Abstract = {Respiration and photosynthesis of the planktonic foraminifera
   Globigerinoides ruber, Orbulina universa, and Globigerinella siphonifera
   and their symbiotic algae were calculated from measured dissolved oxygen
   gradients using microelectrodes, using different temperatures in dark
   and light (250 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1)) conditions. At one temperature
   (24 degrees C) the respiration rate increased as a power function of the
   foraminiferan organic carbon mass with a 0.57 +/- 0.18 exponent. The
   effect of temperature on respiration was quantified in two ways: by
   normalizing the rates to the organic carbon mass and by normalizing the
   observed rates to a constant temperature (24 degrees C). This latter
   normalization was also used for photosynthesis. The respiration rates
   increase as a function of temperature for all species and can be
   described either with a Q(10) = 3.18 (+/- 0.27) or with an Arrhenius
   temperature of T-A = 10,293 degrees K (+/- 768 degrees K). Similar
   calculations for net photosynthesis yielded a Q(10) = 2.68 (+/- 0.36)
   and a T-A = 8766uK (+/- 1203 degrees K), and calculations for gross
   photosynthesis yielded a Q(10) = 2.76 (+/- 0.29) and a T-A = 9026
   degrees K (+/- 926 degrees K). For the species studied, the
   photosynthesis : respiration ratio varied from moderate for G.
   siphonifera (0.58) to very high (13) for O. universa. The high ratios
   indicate that photosynthesis is much higher than the carbon requirements
   for both foraminifera and symbiont growth. This excess carbon might be
   the source of organic exudates.},

Title = {Symbiont genotype influences holobiont response to increased temperature},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {As coral reefs face warming oceans and increased coral bleaching, a
   whitening of the coral due to loss of microalgal endosymbionts, the
   possibility of evolutionary rescue offers some hope for reef
   persistence. In tightly linked mutualisms, evolutionary rescue may occur
   through evolution of the host and/or endosymbionts. Many obligate
   mutualisms are composed of relatively small, fast-growing symbionts with
   greater potential to evolve on ecologically relevant time scales than
   their relatively large, slower growing hosts. Numerous jellyfish species
   harbor closely related endosymbiont taxa to other cnidarian species such
   as coral, and are commonly used as a model system for investigating
   cnidarian mutualisms. We examined the potential for adaptation of the
   upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea xamachana to increased temperature via
   evolution of its microalgal endosymbiont, Symbiodinium microadriaticum.
   We quantified trait variation among five algal genotypes in response to
   three temperatures (26 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 32 degrees C) and
   fitness of hosts infected with each genotype. All genotypes showed
   positive growth rates at each temperature, but rates of respiration and
   photosynthesis decreased with increased temperature. Responses varied
   among genotypes but were unrelated to genetic similarity. The effect of
   temperature on asexual reproduction and the timing of development in the
   host also depended on the genotype of the symbiont. Natural selection
   could favor different algal genotypes at different temperatures,
   affecting host fitness. This eco-evolutionary interaction may be a
   critical component of understanding species resilience in increasingly
   stressful environments.},

Abstract = {Adaptation, acclimatization and symbiont diversity are known to regulate
   thermal tolerance in corals, but the role of these mechanisms remains
   poorly constrained in other photosymbioses, such as large benthic
   foraminifera (LBFs), which are known to bleach at temperatures that are
   likely to be exceeded in the near future. LBFs inhabit a broad range of
   shallow-water settings. Within species, differences in thermal tolerance
   have been found among populations from different habitats, but it is not
   clear whether such differences occur among LBFs inhabiting similar
   habitats, but differing in other aspects, such as symbiont type. To this
   end, we compared responses to thermal stress in specimens from a
   population of Amphistegina lessonii, an abundant Indo-Pacific species,
   to specimens of Amphistegina gibbosa, its Atlantic counter-part, from a
   similar environment but two different water depths (5 and 18 m). Test
   groups of each species were exposed in a common experiment to three
   thermal stress scenarios over a four-week period. Growth, respiration,
   mortality and motility were measured to characterize the holobiont
   response. Coloration, photosynthesis and chlorophyll a content were
   measured to determine the response of the endosymbiotic diatoms. The
   photosymbionts were characterized by genetic fingerprinting. Our results
   show that, although groups of A. gibbosa were collected from different
   habitats, their responses were similar, indicating only marginally
   higher tolerance to thermal peaks in specimens from the shallower site.
   In contrast, species-specific differences were stronger, with A.
   lessonii showing higher tolerance to episodic stress and less pronounced
   impacts of chronic stress on motility, growth and photosymbiont
   performance. These interspecies variations are consistent with the
   presence of different and more diverse symbiont assemblages in A.
   lessonii compared with A. gibbosa. This study demonstrates the
   importance of considering symbiont diversity in the assessment of infra-
   and interspecific variations in stress responses in LBFs.},

Title = {Effects of elevated temperature and <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> on the

Abstract = {Many reef organisms, such as the giant clams, are confronted with global
   change effects. Abnormally high seawater temperatures can lead to mass
   bleaching events and subsequent mortality, while ocean acidification may
   impact biomineralization processes. Despite its strong ecological and
   socio-economic importance, its responses to these threats still need to
   be explored. We investigated physiological responses of 4-year-old
   Tridacna maxima to realistic levels of temperature (+1.5 degrees C) and
   partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) (+800 mu atm of CO2)
   predicted for 2100 in French Polynesian lagoons during the warmer
   season. During a 65-day crossed-factorial experiment, individuals were
   exposed to two temperatures (29.2 degrees C, 30.7 degrees C) and two
   pCO(2) (430 mu atm, 1212 mu atm) conditions. The impact of each
   environmental parameter and their potential synergetic effect were
   evaluated based on respiration, biomineralization and photophysiology.
   Kinetics of thermal and/or acidification stress were evaluated by
   performing measurements at different times of exposure (29, 41, 53, 65
   days). At 30.7 degrees C, the holobiont O-2 production, symbiont
   photosynthetic yield and density were negatively impacted. High pCO(2)
   had a significant negative effect on shell growth rate, symbiont
   photosynthetic yield and density. No significant differences of the
   shell microstructure were observed between control and experimental
   conditions in the first 29 days; however, modifications (i.e.
   less-cohesive lamellae) appeared from 41 days in all temperature and
   pCO(2) conditions. No significant synergetic effect was found. Present
   thermal conditions (29.2 degrees C) appeared to be sufficiently
   stressful to induce a host acclimatization response. All these
   observations indicate that temperature and pCO(2) are both forcing
   variables affecting T. maxima's physiology and jeopardize its survival
   under environmental conditions predicted for the end of this century.},

Title = {Symbiont Chloroplasts Remain Active During Bleaching-Like Response

   Retaria)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Month = {OCT 29},
Abstract = {Collodaria (Retaria) are important contributors to planktonic
   communities and biogeochemical processes (e.g., the biologic pump) in
   oligotrophic oceans. Similarly to corals, Collodaria live in symbiosis
   with dinoflagellate algae, a relationship that is thought to explain
   partly their ecological success. In the context of global change, the
   robustness of the symbiotic interaction, and potential subsequent
   bleaching events are of primary interest for oceanic ecosystems
   functioning. In the present study, we compared the ultrastructure,
   morphology, symbiont density, photosynthetic capacities and respiration
   rates of colonial Collodaria exposed to a range of temperatures
   corresponding to natural conditions (21 degrees C), moderate (25 degrees
   C), and high (28 degrees C) thermal stress. We showed that symbiont
   density immediately decreased when temperature rose to 25 degrees C,
   while the overall Collodaria holobiont metabolic activity increased.
   When temperature reached 28 degrees C, the holobiont respiration nearly
   stopped and the host morphological structure was largely damaged, as if
   the host tolerance threshold has been crossed. Over the course of the
   experiment, the photosynthetic capacities of remaining algal symbionts
   were stable, chloroplasts being the last degraded organelles in the
   microalgae. These results contribute to a better characterization and
   understanding of temperature-induced bleaching processes in planktonic
   photosymbioses.},

Volume = {58},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Minor and trace elements in foraminiferal carbonates are potential
   paleo-proxies of climate, nutrient and seawater composition. There are
   very few reports of trace element composition of symbiont-bearing,
   larger foraminifera that are known to be important constituents of
   shallow-marine, modem and ancient carbonates. In this paper we examine
   the range of variation in Mg and Sr content of Recent species of these
   foraminifera from a lagoon of Lakshadweep Atoll (Indian Ocean) and
   Akajima Islands, Japan. Two hyaline species, Amphistegina lessonii and
   Neorotalia calcar,and two porcellaneous species, Antphisorus hentprichii
   and Marginopora vertebralis were collected live from Lakshadweep
   islands. Mg/Ca in these foraminifera is of an order of magnitude higher
   than the values reported for planktonic and symbiont-free benthic
   foraminifera. The Sr/Ca values are, however, comparable with the
   reported values in other foraminiferal taxa and they are found to vary
   within a narrow range. Electron-probe micro-analysis of three
   symbiont-bearing benthic species indicates spatial heterogeneity of high
   orders in Mg/Ca composition in all the species. The annual variation in
   temperature and pH of the lagoon water cannot explain the observed
   amplitude of the compositional variation. The photosynthesis and
   respiration of the symbionts and host foraminifera are possibly the
   major cause of compositional heterogeneity in individual tests, as has
   also been recently postulated for symbiont-bearing planktonic
   foraminiferal species. It highlights the need to isolate biological
   factors and necessitates species-specific paleotemperature scale in
   paleoclimatic analysis. We also analyzed delta O-18, delta C-13, Ca, Mg
   and Sr in carefully dissected chambers of a reef-dwelling, porcellaneous
   benthic foraminifer, Marginopora kudakajimaensis, collected live in four
   seasons. A moderate positive correlation is observed between Mg/Ca and
   temperature. However, large inter- and intra-test variation in Mg limits
   the precision of Mg/Ca as palaeotemperature proxy. The Sr/Ca of the test
   calcite is unrelated to temperature of the sea water. The delta C-13 of
   M. kudakajiniaensis does not correlate with delta O-18, Mg/Ca or Sr/Ca.

Abstract = {Elevated temperatures and nutrients are degrading coral reef ecosystems,
   but the understanding of how early life stages of reef corals respond to
   these stressors remains limited. Here, we test the impact of temperature
   (mean similar to 27 degrees C vs. similar to 29 degrees C) and nitrate
   and phosphate enrichment (ambient, + 5 mu M nitrate, + 1 mu M phosphate
   and combined + 5 mu M nitrate with 1 mu M phosphate) on coral larvae
   using three Hawaiian coral species with different modes of symbiont
   transmission and reproduction: Lobactis scutaria (horizontal, gonochoric
   broadcast spawner), Pocillopora acuta (vertical, hermaphroditic brooder)
   and Montipora capitata (vertical, hermaphroditic broadcast spawner).
   Temperature and nutrient effects were species specific and appear
   antagonistic for L. scutaria and M. capitata, but not for P. acuta.
   Larvae survivorship in all species was lowest under nitrate enrichment
   at 27 degrees C. M. capitata and L. scutaria survivorship increased at
   29 degrees C. However, positive effects of warming on survivorship were
   lost under high nitrate, but phosphate attenuated nitrate effects when
   N/P ratios were balanced. P. acuta larvae exhibited high survivorship (>
   91\%) in all treatments and showed little change in larval size, but
   lower respiration rates at 29 degrees C. Elevated nutrients (+N+P) led
   to the greatest loss in larvae size for aposymbiotic L. scutaria, while
   positive growth in symbiotic M. capitata larvae was reduced under
   warming and highest in +N+P treatments. Overall, we report a greater
   sensitivity of broadcast spawners to warming and nutrient changes
   compared to a brooding coral species. These results suggest variability
   in biological responses to warming and nutrient enrichment is influenced
   by life-history traits, including the presence of symbionts (vertical
   transmission), in addition to nutrient type and nutrient stoichiometry.},

Abstract = {Perturbed colonies of Phenganax parrini and Sarcothelia sp. exhibit
   migration of symbionts of Symbiodinium spp. into the stolons.
   Densitometry and visual inspection indicated that polyps bleached while
   stolons did not. When migration was triggered by temperature, light and
   confinement, colonies of Sarcothelia sp. decreased rates of oxygen
   formation in the light (due to the effects of perturbation on
   photosynthesis and respiration) and increased rates of oxygen uptake in
   the dark (due to the effects of perturbation on respiration alone).
   Colonies of P. parrini, by contrast, showed no significant changes in
   either aspect of oxygen metabolism. When migration was triggered by
   light and confinement, colonies of Sarcothelia sp. showed decreased
   rates of oxygen formation in the light and increased rates of oxygen
   uptake in the dark, while colonies of P. parrini maintained the former
   and increased the latter. During symbiont migration into their stolons,
   colonies of both species showed dramatic increases in reactive oxygen
   species (ROS), as visualized with a fluorescent probe, with stolons of
   Sarcothelia sp. exhibiting a nearly immediate increase of ROS.
   Differences in symbiont type may explain the greater sensitivity of
   colonies of Sarcothelia sp. Using fluorescent probes, direct
   measurements of migrating symbionts in the stolons of Sarcothelia sp.
   showed higher levels of reactive nitrogen species and lower levels of
   ROS than the surrounding host tissue. As measured by native
   fluorescence, levels of NAD(P) H in the stolons were unaffected by
   perturbation. Symbiont migration thus correlates with dramatic
   physiological changes and may serve as a marker for coral condition.},

Abstract = {The association between the symbiont Symbiodinium microadriaticum
   (zooxanthellae) and its host jellyfish, Cassiopea xamachana, was
   investigated as a function of jellyfish size and season. Symbiont cell
   diameter and volume were higher during January than September. Although
   zooxanthella-specific chlorophyll was independent of jellyfish size,
   both chlorophyll a and c were higher during January. Regardless of
   season, algal density and jellyfish size were inversely related. The
   diel mitotic index (MI) of zooxanthellae was phased, with a peak of
   0.25\% occurring between 09:00 and 12:00 h. September photosynthetic
   rates were always higher than January rates and reflected the seasonal
   light and temperature regimes at the latitude of the Florida Keys (USA).
   Photosynthesis, when normalized to either zooxanthella density or
   protein, displayed an inverse relationship with jellyfish size. Medusan
   respiration rates also showed an inverse relationship with jellyfish
   size, with September metabolism being higher than that of January. The
   carbon budgets calculated for these medusae indicate that the carbon
   photosynthetically fixed by the zooxanthellae, and subsequently
   translocated to the host, is capable of satisfying about 169\% of the
   host's metabolic demand (CZAR) and is independent of both jellyfish size
   and season. These seasonally influenced physiological effects underscore
   the necessity for seasonal examinations of algal-cnidarian symbioses in

Volume = {33},

Abstract = {A terminal electron acceptor alternative to mitochondrial cytochrome c
   oxidase (COX), mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX), is ubiquitous in
   higher plants and represented in nearly every algal taxon but is poorly
   documented in dinoflagellates. AOX competes for electrons with the
   conventional COX and has been hypothesized to function as a means of
   reducing oxidative stress in mitochondria, as well as a potential
   mechanism for ameliorating thermal and other physiological stressors.
   Here, the presence of an active AOX in cultured Symbiodinium was assayed
   by the response of oxygen consumption to the AOX inhibitor
   salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) and the COX inhibitor cyanide (CN).
   CN-insensitive, SHAM-sensitive oxygen consumption was found to account
   for a large portion (26 \%) of Symbiodinium dark respiration and is
   consistent with high levels of AOX activity. This experimental evidence
   of the existence of a previously unreported terminal oxidase was further
   corroborated by analysis of publicly available Symbiodinium
   transcriptome data. The potential for enhanced AOX expression to play a
   compensatory role in mediating thermal stress was supported by inhibitor
   assays of cultured Symbiodinium at low (18 A degrees C), moderate (26 A
   degrees C), and high (32 A degrees C) temperature conditions. Maximum
   capacity of the putative AOX pathway as a proportion of total dark
   oxygen consumption was found to increase from 26 \% at 26 A degrees C to
   45 \% and 53 \% at 18 A degrees C and 32 A degrees C, respectively, when
   cells were acclimated to the treatment temperatures. Cells assayed at 18
   and 32 A degrees C without acclimation exhibited either the same or
   lower AOX capacity as controls, suggesting that the AOX protein is
   upregulated under temperature stress. The physiological implications for
   the presence of AOX in the coral/algal symbiosis and its potential role
   in response to many forms of biotic and abiotic stress, particularly

Abstract = {The Mg/Ca composition of calcium carbonate tests (shells) secreted by
   planktonic foraminifera is increasingly being employed to estimate past
   seawater temperatures and reconstruct paleocean and climate records
   spanning hundreds of thousands of years. We show, using two
   high-resolution microanalysis techniques, that the final chamber of the
   planktonic foraminifera Orbulina universa typically comprises between
   three and six paired, low and high Mg, growth bands. The number and
   spacing of these bands is consistent with a diurnal origin, modulated by
   changing pH within the foraminiferal microenvironment due to the
   day-night, photosynthesis-respiration cycle of algal symbionts. The
   amplitude of Mg/Ca variation within individual tests and across many
   daily growth bands cannot be accounted for by seawater temperature in
   the shallow, euphotic zone habitat of O. universa. Our results indicate
   the Mg/Ca composition of calcite precipitated by O. universa in nature
   is strongly influenced by diurnal changes in the biological activity of
   algal symbionts and the host foraminifer. This brings into question the
   fundamental premise often made in applying Mg/Ca palaeoseawater
   thermometry, that the Mg/Ca composition of foraminiferal calcite is
   determined by seawater temperature, and whether the Mg/Ca composition of
   other planktonic species that are more widely used for palaeoseawater
   thermometry are subject to similar influences. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Most plant species form mycorrhizas, yet these are neglected by plant
   physiologists. One consequence of this neglect is reduced ability to
   predict plant respiration, because respiration rate (R) in mycorrhizal

   substrate availability associated with enhanced nutrient uptake, coupled
   with increased respiratory product demand. Other predictions include
   that mycorrhizal colonization will affect scaling of R with tissue
   nitrogen concentrations; that mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal root R
   differ in their response to nutrient supply; and that the impact of
   colonization on R is related to fungal biomass. Failure to examine
   properly the role of colonization in determining root R means that

Abstract = {The sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima hosts two phylogenetically
   different symbiotic microalgae, a dinoflagellate Symbiodinium
   (zooxanthellae, ZX) and a chlorophyte (zoochlorellae, ZC). The
   photosynthetic productivity (P), respiration (R), and contribution of
   algal carbon translocated to the host (CZAR) in response to a year's
   seasonal ambient changes of natural light and temperature are documented
   for both ZX- and ZC-bearing anemones. Light and temperature both affect
   photosynthesis, respiration, and CZAR, as well as various algal
   parameters; while there are evident seasonal differences, for the most
   part the relative effects on P, R, and CZAR by the two environmental
   variables cannot be determined. Net photosynthesis (P-n) of both ZX and
   ZC was significantly higher during spring and summer. During these
   seasons, the P-n of ZX was always greater than that of ZC. Regardless of
   algal symbiont, anemone respiration (R) was significantly higher during
   the spring and summer. The annual net carbon fixation rate of anemones
   with ZX and ZC was 325 and 276 mg C anemone(-1) year(-1), respectively,
   which translates to annual net community productivity rates of 92 and 60
   g C m(-1) year(-1) for anemones with ZX or ZC, respectively. CZAR did
   not show a clear relationship with season; however the CZAR for ZX was
   always significantly greater than for ZC. Lower ZX growth rates, coupled
   with higher photosynthetic rates and higher CZAR estimates, compared to
   ZC, suggest that if A. elegantissima is simply carbon limited,
   ZX-bearing anemones should be the dominant symbiont in the field.
   However ZC-bearing anemones persist in low light and reduced temperature
   microhabitats, therefore more than the translocation of carbon from ZC
   must be involved. Given that global climate change will increase water
   temperatures, the potential for latitudinal range shifts of both ZC and
   ZX (S. californium and muscatinei) might be used as biological
   indicators of thermal shifts in the littoral zone of the Pacific
   Northwest.},

Abstract = {This study experimentally investigated the effect of an early summer
   short-term summer thermal anomaly in November on Heron Reef (Great
   Barrier Reef), on the performance of the coral-algal symbiosis during a
   subsequent, thermally induced bleaching event (defined by loss of
   symbionts) in February 2009. Fragments of the reef flat coral, Acropora
   millepora, exposed to the two heating events lost 78\% of their
   symbionts and showed a 64\% decline in dark adapted quantum yield
   (Fv/Fm) to values less than 0.25. Whereas corals that were only heated
   in the second event lost 57\% symbionts and displayed a 75\% decline in
   Fv/Fm to values less than 0.2. Coral in both pre-stressed and non
   pre-stressed treatments at 34 degrees C had net photosynthetic rates
   significantly less than zero (P-net max<0), suggesting that daytime O-2
   respiration rates were significantly greater than rates of O-2 evolution
   through photosynthesis. Increases in the daily light field and/or
   increases in temperature led to the observation of dark-adapted
   xanthophyll de-epoxidation suggesting that the potential for
   non-photochemical quenching is maintained into the dark (after 1 h dark
   adaption). Pre-stressed corals were also found to have de-epoxidation
   ratios three times greater than non pre-stressed corals at 34 degrees C
   and xanthophyll pool to Chl a, much greater than non pre-stressed
   corals. Combined, these results indicate that symbionts in pre-stressed
   corals have a greater ability to dump incoming light energy as heat We
   conclude that whilst differences were observed between pre-stressed and
   non pre-stressed populations in measurements of photosynthetic
   productivity, photosynthetic pigments and areal protein, thermal
   bleaching as defined by symbiont loss did not vary between treatments.

Abstract = {Understanding how rising seawater pCO(2) and temperatures impact coral
   aragonite accretion is essential for predicting the future of reef
   ecosystems. Here, we report 2 long-term (10-11 month) studies assessing
   the effects of temperature (25 and 28 degrees C) and both high and low
   seawater pCO(2) (180-750 mu atm) on the calcification, photosynthesis
   and respiration of individual massive Porites spp. genotypes.
   Calcification rates were highly variable between genotypes, but high
   seawater pCO(2) reduced calcification significantly in 4 of 7 genotypes
   cultured at 25 degrees C but in only 1 of 4 genotypes cultured at 28
   degrees C. Increasing seawater temperature enhanced calcification in
   almost all corals, but the magnitude of this effect was seawater pCO(2)
   dependent. The 3 degrees C temperature increase enhanced calcification
   rate on average by 3\% at 180 mu atm, by 35\% at 260 mu atm and by >
   300\% at 750 mu atm. The rate increase at high seawater pCO(2) exceeds
   that observed in inorganic aragonites. Responses of gross/net
   photosynthesis and respiration to temperature and seawater pCO(2) varied
   between genotypes, but rates of all these processes were reduced at the
   higher seawater temperature. Increases in seawater temperature, below
   the thermal stress threshold, may mitigate against ocean acidification
   in this coral genus, but this moderation is not mediated by an increase
   in net photosynthesis. The response of coral calcification to
   temperature cannot be explained by symbiont productivity or by
   thermodynamic and kinetic influences on aragonite formation.},

Abstract = {Algal symbiont-bearing benthic foraminifera are producers of both
   organic and inorganic carbon in coral-reef ecosystems. However, their
   contribution to the total budget of reef carbon production has not been
   adequately quantified. We used O-2-respirometry and alkalinity-anomaly
   techniques to estimate the organic and inorganic carbon production rates
   of three species of symbiont-bearing large foraminifera common to coral
   reef flats in the northwest Pacific Ocean. The species studied were
   Baculogypsina sphaerulata and Calearina gaudichaudii, which both harbor
   diatom endosymbionts, and Marginopora kudakajimensis, which harbors
   dinoflagellate endosymbionts. Live mature individuals were placed onto
   mesh in clear airtight containers filled with filtered seawater. The
   containers were incubated for several hours at a constant temperature
   and subjected to different levels of light intensity. Seawater was
   continuously mixed throughout the experiment. Dissolved oxygen, pH and
   total alkalinity were measured before and after incubation. Three
   species of larger benthic foraminifera were net organic and inorganic
   carbon producers. The P/R ratio exceeded 1 for all species. No
   photoinhibition was observed up to 1500 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), and
   calcification was enhanced by light. These findings suggest that the
   three species are net carbon producers adapted to high-light, reef-flat
   environments. In addition, we calculated that Baculogypsina sphaerulata
   and C. gaudichaudii together accounted for 2-7.5\% of the gross primary
   production of a reef-crest community, whereas M. kudakajimensis supplied
   1-11\% of the gross primary production of a backreef community. The two
   calcarinids and M. kudakajimensis contributed similar to 1 and 10\% of
   the inorganic carbon production of seaward reef flat and protected
   lagoon communities, respectively. Together with previous reports, these
   estimates suggest that algal symbiont-bearing foraminifera play a minor
   but essential role in the organic and inorganic carbon production of
   coral-reef ecosystems.},

   investigated the effect of three temperatures (5, 20, and 35 A degrees

   significantly altered by the extreme temperatures (5 and 35 A degrees C)
   and the pH level produced differences in the fungal characters at pH
   8.5. The alga was more tolerant of the wide temperature range than the
   fungus while the fungus was more tolerant of pH changes than the alga.
   An interaction effect by temperature and pH on the symbiont characters

Abstract = {The impact of elevated CO2 and temperature on photosynthesis and

   (28, 32 A degrees C) and pCO(2) (400, 1,000 A mu atm) levels spanning a
   range of current and future climate-change scenarios. The photosynthetic
   capacity of M. vertebralis was measured with O-2 microsensors and a
   pulse-amplitude-modulated chlorophyll (Chl) fluorometer, in combination
   with estimates of Chl a and Chl c (2) concentrations and calcification
   rates. After 5 weeks, control specimens remained unaltered for all
   parameters. Chlorophyll a concentrations significantly decreased in the
   specimens at 1,000 A mu atm CO2 for both temperatures, while no change
   in Chl c (2) concentration was observed. Photoinhibition was observed
   under elevated CO2 and temperature, with a 70-80 \% decrease in the

   elevated temperatures in both CO2 treatments as compared to the control
   temperature, supporting that temperature has more impact on
   photosynthesis and O-2 flux than changes in ambient CO2. Photosynthetic
   pigment loss and a decrease in photochemical efficiency are thus likely
   to occur with increased temperature. The elevated CO2 and high

Abstract = {Throughout its geographic range, the temperate-zone anemone Anthopleura
   elegantissima is the host of one or both of two distinctively different
   symbiotic microalgae: a dinoflagellate Symbiodinium (zooxanthellae, ZX)
   and a chlorophyte (zoochlorellae, ZC). Given the broad vertical
   intertidal and latitudinal range of this anemone, we investigated the
   role of temperature in determining whether A. elegantissima supports one
   algal symbiont over the other and whether temperature regulates the
   observed distributions of natural populations of ZX and ZC. Temperature
   appears to be a key factor in regulating both the photophysiology and
   metabolism of this algal-cnidarian association. In anemones containing
   ZX, neither algal densities nor chlorophyll content varied with
   temperature (6-24.degreesC); in contrast, anemones with ZC displayed
   reduced densities and chlorophyll content at the highest temperature
   treatment (24 degreesC). Both. ZX and ZC photosynthetic rates were
   directly related to temperature, as were anemone respiration rates. The
   higher photosynthetic rates, maintenance of a stable algal density and
   chlorophyll content, and higher potential contribution of algal carbon
   toward animal respiration (CZAR) suggest that the ZX are the more viable
   symbiont as temperature increases, but we suggest alternative reasons
   why ZC are preserved in this symbiotic association. Elevated
   temperatures reduce ZC densities and chlorophyll, suggesting that higher
   temperatures affect this relationship in a negative fashion, presumably
   due to a higher cost of maintaining ZC by the association;
   alternatively, these costs may be affiliated with the deterioration of
   the ZC themselves. These results suggest that temperature may be one of
   the most significant environmental parameters that sets the intertidal
   microhabitat and latitudinal distribution patterns of the two algal taxa
   observed in the field.},

Title = {Individual variation in growth and physiology of symbionts in response
   to temperature},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},

Abstract = {In many cases, understanding species' responses to climate change
   requires understanding variation among individuals in response to such
   change. For species with strong symbiotic relationships, such as many
   coral reef species, genetic variation in symbiont responses to
   temperature may affect the response to increased ocean temperatures. To
   assess variation among symbiont genotypes, we examined the population
   dynamics and physiological responses of genotypes of Breviolum
   antillogorgium in response to increased temperature. We found broad
   temperature tolerance across genotypes, with all genotypes showing
   positive growth at 26, 30, and 32 degrees C. Genotypes differed in the
   magnitude of the response of growth rate and carrying capacity to
   increasing temperature, suggesting that natural selection could favor
   different genotypes at different temperatures. However, the historical
   temperature at which genotypes were reared (26 or 30 degrees C) was not
   a good predictor of contemporary temperature response. We found
   increased photosynthetic rates and decreased respiration rates with
   increasing contemporary temperature, and differences in physiology among
   genotypes, but found no significant differences in the response of these
   traits to temperature among genotypes. In species with such broad
   thermal tolerance, selection experiments on symbionts outside of the
   host may not yield results sufficient for evolutionary rescue from
   climate change.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are endangered by constantly rising water temperature due to
   global warming. This triggers a breakdown of the nutritional symbiosis
   between cnidarian hosts and their Symbiodiniaceae symbionts, resulting
   in the loss of the algal partner. In the Symbiodiniaceae exists a high
   genetic diversity with broad physiological plasticity within and between
   species, resulting in large thermal tolerance. While these variations
   have been studied in individual taxa, comprehensive comparative
   experimental data on numerous species are still rare. In the present
   study, the photosynthetic performance and tolerance as function of light
   and temperature of nine Symbiodiniaceae genetic types of four different
   clades were determined. The data indicate significant differences in the
   response patterns. Almost all algal isolates exhibited low to moderate
   light requirements for photosynthesis without photoinhibition, and a
   photosynthetic efficiency between 20 and 80\% in the temperature range
   20-34 degrees C, indicating a broad thermal tolerance to temperature
   fluctuations in tropical regions. The presented data clearly point to a
   broad photophysiological tolerance and thermal plasticity of genetically
   different Symbiodiniaceae, which contributes as an important finding to
   a better understanding of host-symbiont response to an increasing sea
   surface temperature.},

Abstract = {Dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium, the endosymbiont of reef
   corals, play an important role in coral-bleaching events which can be
   induced by prolonged enhanced seawater temperature anomalies, and which
   are predicted to occur at increasing frequencies and severities due to
   global warming. The genus Symbiodinium exhibits high genetic diversity
   with physiological variation within and among species, leading to a
   range of thermal tolerance. Although these variations have been examined
   in individual species, comprehensive comparative experimental data
   across several species are still rare. Therefore, in the present study,
   the photophysiological and thermal response patterns of six genetically
   characterized Symbiodinium genotypes were comparatively investigated.
   The six Symbiodinium genotypes were isolated from four different host
   species from the following biogeographic locations: Hawaii (Central
   Pacific), Panama (Caribbean), Florida (Caribbean), and Palau (West
   Pacific). Photosynthesis-irradiance curve and growth measurements at
   temperatures ranging from 20 to 33 A degrees C were carried out. All
   physiological data clearly indicate significant differences in the
   response patterns of the six Symbiodinium genotypes. While some types
   photosynthesized, respired, and grew at 33 A degrees C, others showed a
   partial or complete inhibition. The genotype-specific response over the
   experimental temperature reveals the potential range response of a given
   symbiont and variation between strains that adaptation might act upon.},

Abstract = {The dinoflagellate Symbiodinium trenchii associates with a wide array of
   host corals throughout the world, and its thermal tolerance has made it
   of particular interest within the context of reef coral resilience to a
   warming climate. However, future reefs are increasingly likely to face
   combined environmental stressors, further complicating our understanding
   of how S. trenchii will possibly acclimatize to future climate
   scenarios. Over a 33-day period, we characterized the individual and
   combined affects of high temperature (26.5 vs. 31.5 degrees C), pCO(2)
   (400 vs. 760 mu atm), and elevated nutrients (0.4 and 0.2 vs. 3.5 and
   0.3 mu mol of NO3/NO2 and PO43-, respectively) on S. trenchii within the
   host coral species Turbinaria reniformis. Global analysis across all
   treatments found temperature to be the largest driver of physiological
   change. However, exposure to elevated temperature led to changes in
   symbiont physiology that differed across pCO(2) concentrations. Net
   photosynthesis and cellular chlorophyll a increased with temperature
   under ambient pCO(2), whereas temperature-related differences in
   cellular volume and its affect on pigment packaging were more pronounced
   under elevated pCO(2). Furthermore, increased nutrients mitigated the
   physiological response to high temperature under both ambient and
   elevated pCO(2) conditions and represented a significant interaction
   between all three physical parameters. Individual responses to
   temperature and pCO(2) were also observed as cellular density declined
   with elevated temperature and calcification along with respiration rates
   declined with increased pCO(2). Symbiodinium trenchii remained the
   dominant symbiont population within the host across all treatment
   combinations. Our results reveal distinct physiological changes in
   response to high temperature within the S. trenchii/T. reniformis
   symbioses that are dependent on pCO(2) and nutrient concentration, and
   represent important interactive effects to consider as we consider how
   corals will respond under future climate change scenarios.},

Abstract = {Lichens are a symbiosis between a fungus and one or more photosynthetic
   microorganisms that enables the symbionts to thrive in places and
   conditions they could not compete independently. Exchanges of water and
   sugars between the symbionts are the established mechanisms that support
   lichen symbiosis. Herein, we present a new linkage between algal
   photosynthesis and fungal respiration in lichen Flavoparmelia caperata
   that extends the physiological nature of symbiotic co-dependent
   metabolisms, mutually boosting energy conversion rates in both
   symbionts. Measurements of electron transport by oximetry show that
   photosynthetic O-2 is consumed internally by fungal respiration. At low
   light intensity, very low levels of O-2 are released, while
   photosynthetic electron transport from water oxidation is normal as
   shown by intrinsic chlorophyll variable fluorescence yield (period-4
   oscillations in flash-induced Fv/Fm). The rate of algal O-2 production
   increases following consecutive series of illumination periods, at low
   and with limited saturation at high light intensities, in contrast to
   light saturation in free-living algae. We attribute this effect to arise
   from the availability of more CO2 produced by fungal respiration of
   photosynthetically generated sugars. We conclude that the lichen
   symbionts are metabolically coupled by energy conversion through
   exchange of terminal electron donors and acceptors used in both
   photosynthesis and fungal respiration. Algal sugars and O-2 are consumed
   by the fungal symbiont, while fungal delivered CO2 is consumed by the
   alga.},

Abstract = {Two inhibitors of the Calvin-Benson cycle {[}glycolaldehyde (GA) and
   potassium cyanide (KCN)] were used in cultured Symbiodinium cells and in
   nubbins of the coral Pocillopora damicornis to test the hypothesis that
   inhibition of the Calvin-Benson cycle triggers coral bleaching.
   Inhibitor concentration range-finding trials aimed to determine the
   appropriate concentration to generate inhibition of the Calvin-Benson
   cycle, but avoid other metabolic impacts to the symbiont and the animal
   host. Both 3 mmol l(-1) GA and 20 mol l(-1) KCN caused minimal
   inhibition of host respiration, but did induce photosynthetic
   impairment, measured by a loss of photosystem II function and oxygen
   production. GA did not affect the severity of bleaching, nor induce
   bleaching in the absence of thermal stress, suggesting inhibition of the
   Calvin-Benson cycle by GA does not initiate bleaching in P. damicornis.
   In contrast, KCN did activate a bleaching response through symbiont
   expulsion, which occurred in the presence and absence of thermal stress.
   While KCN is an inhibitor of the Calvin-Benson cycle, it also promotes
   reactive oxygen species formation, and it is likely that this was the
   principal agent in the coral bleaching process. These findings do not
   support the hypothesis that temperature-induced inhibition of the
   Calvin-Benson cycle alone induces coral bleaching.},

Abstract = {Sponges are major components of benthic communities across the world and
   have been identified as potential ``winners{''} on coral reefs in the
   face of global climate change as result of their tolerance to ocean
   warming and acidification (OA). Previous studies have also hypothesised
   that photosymbiont-containing sponges might have higher productivity
   under future OA conditions as a result of photosymbionts having
   increased access to CO2 and subsequently greater carbon production. Here
   we test this hypothesis for a widespread and abundant
   photosymbiont-containing sponge species Lamellodysidea herbacea at a CO2
   seep in Papua New Guinea simulating OA conditions. We found seep sponges
   had relatively higher cyanobacterial abundance, chlorophyll
   concentrations and symbiont photosynthetic efficiency than non-seep
   sponges, and a three-fold higher sponge abundance at the seep site.
   However, while gross oxygen production was the same for seep and
   non-seep sponges, seep sponge dark respiration rates were higher and
   instantaneous photosynthesis: respiration (P:R) ratios were lower. We
   show that while photosymbiont containing sponges may not have increased
   productivity under OA, they are able to show flexibility in their
   relationships with microbes and offset increased metabolic costs
   associated with climate change associated stress.},

Abstract = {Atmospheric CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) is expected to increase to 700
   mu atm or more by the end of the present century. Anthropogenic CO2 is
   absorbed by the oceans, leading to decreases in pH and the CaCO3
   saturation state (Omega) of the seawater. Elevated pCO(2) was shown to
   drastically decrease calcification rates in tropical zooxanthellate
   corals. Here we show, using the Mediterranean zooxanthellate coral
   Cladocora caespitosa, that an increase in pCO(2), in the range predicted
   for 2100, does not reduce its calcification rate. Therefore, the
   conventional belief that calcification rates will be affected by ocean
   acidification may not be widespread in temperate corals. Seasonal change
   in temperature is the predominant factor controlling photosynthesis,
   respiration, calcification and symbiont density. An increase in pCO(2),
   alone or in combination with elevated temperature, had no significant
   effect on photosynthesis, photosynthetic efficiency and calcification.
   The lack of sensitivity C. caespitosa to elevated pCO(2) might be due to
   its slow growth rates, which seem to be more dependent on temperature
   than on the saturation state of calcium carbonate in the range projected
   for the end of the century.},

Abstract = {An important question in climate modeling is whether carbon cycling is
   fundamentally different in warm versus cold climate states. A key line
   of evidence regarding this question comes from the unusually large
   difference in carbon-isotope values (delta C-13) between
   shallow-dwelling muricate foraminifera and foraminifera living deeper in
   the water column in the Paleogene. This has been interpreted as evidence
   that warmer temperatures elevated the metabolic rates of
   carbon-recycling bacteria, resulting in a steeper gradient in the delta
   C-13 of dissolved inorganic carbon (delta C-13(DIC)) and reduced carbon
   export. However, this interpretation depends on the assumption that
   vital effects-biological processes that bias foraminiferal delta
   C-13-are constant throughout time. We test this assumption using a
   chemical model of the foraminiferal microenvironment and find that the
   hypothesized increase in metabolic rates should also increase vital
   effects, meaning that both Paleogene delta C-13(DIC) gradients and the
   temperature dependence of metabolism must have been significantly lower
   than previously estimated. We further propose that muricate foraminifera
   may have evolved a novel ``mat{''} strategy for photosymbiosis wherein
   symbionts rested on the muricae in a thin layer surrounding the shell.
   This hypothesis can explain both the function of muricae and the
   observed isotopic data without the need for any change in metabolism.
   Our work thus challenges existing interpretations of delta C-13 and
   provides a path forward to empirically test the magnitude of
   temperature-dependent metabolic change in the deep past.},

Abstract = {Establishing the thermal reaction norm of coral larvae under elevated
   pCO(2) is crucial to anticipate how larval dispersal and population
   maintenance may be affected by future climate change. Here, we
   characterized the functional relationship between temperature (27-33
   degrees C) and larval performance of the reef coral Pocillopora
   damicornis under two pCO(2) levels. The results showed that the
   temperature threshold of larvae was between 32 and 33 degrees C, as
   evidenced by the abrupt declines in photochemical efficiency and
   symbiont density, whereas no oxidative damage was observed between 27
   and 33 degrees C and elevated pCO(2) did not influence any of these
   parameters. In addition, larval respiration and photosynthesis rates
   exhibited parabolic responses to temperature, and this relationship
   conformed to the Gaussian-Gompertz model with an optimal temperature
   around 31.5 degrees C, which was approximately 2.5 degrees C above the
   summer mean temperature, suggesting the potential for thermal
   acclimation. Most importantly, elevated pCO(2) significantly enhanced
   the larval photosynthesis and the stimulatory effect of elevated pCO(2)
   on the photosynthetic rates and capacity was more pronounced in cool and
   warm temperatures, indicative of shifted thermal sensitivity under high
   pCO(2). These results suggest that ocean acidification could alter the
   thermal performance curves and tolerance window of brooded P. damicornis
   larvae, with profound and important implications for larval ecology in a
   future changing ocean.},

Abstract = {In this study, we tested whether larvae brooded by the reef coral
   Pocillopora damicornis from a naturally extreme and highly variable
   environment are preadapted to cope with predicted increases in
   temperature and pCO(2). We exposed larvae to two temperatures (29 vs.
   30.8 degrees C) crossed with two pCO(2) levels (similar to 500 vs.
   similar to 1000 mu atm) in a full-factorial experiment for 5 d. Larval
   performance was assessed as dark respiration (R-D), net and gross
   photosynthesis (P-N and P-G, respectively), survival, settlement, and
   the activity of carbonic anhydrase (CA), the central enzyme involved in
   photosynthesis. The results showed that R-D was unaffected by either
   elevated temperature or pCO(2), while elevated temperature and/or pCO(2)
   stimulated P-N and P-G and increased the ratios of P-N to R-D,
   indicating a relatively higher autotrophic capacity. Consequently,
   larval survivorship under elevated temperature and/or pCO(2) was
   consistently 14\% higher than that under the control treatment.
   Furthermore, elevated temperature and pCO(2) did not affect host CA
   activity, but synergistically enhanced symbiont CA activity,
   contributing greatly to the stimulated photosynthetic capacity. These
   results suggest that brooded larvae of P. damicornis larvae from
   Luhuitou may be preadapted to cope with projected warming and ocean
   acidification. More generally, it appears that corals from highly
   variable environments may have increased resilience to the widespread
   climate change.},

Abstract = {Species have evolved different mechanisms to cope with spatial and
   temporal temperature variability. Species with broad geographical
   distributions may be thermal generalists that perform well across a
   broad range of temperatures, or they might contain subpopulations of
   locally adapted thermal specialists. We quantified the variation in
   thermal performance of two coral species, Porites cylindrica and
   Acropora spp., along a latitudinal gradient over which temperature
   varies by approximately 68 degrees C. Photosynthesis rates, respiration
   rates, maximum quantum yield and maximum electron transport rates were
   measured on coral fragments exposed to an acute temperature increase and
   decrease up to 58 degrees C above and below the local average
   temperature. Results showed geographical variation in the performance
   curves of both species at holobiont and symbiont level, but this did not
   lead to an alignment of the optimal temperature for performance with the
   average temperature of the local environment, suggesting suboptimal
   coral performance of these coral populations in summer. Furthermore,
   symbiont thermal performance generally had an optimum closer to the
   average environmental temperature than holobiont performance, suggesting
   that symbionts have a higher capacity for acclimatization than the coral
   host, and can aid the coral host when temperatures are unfavourable.

Abstract = {Thermal performance curves describe the relationship between temperature
   and the rate of biological processes. These relationships can vary among
   species and environments, allowing organisms to acclimatize to their
   local thermal regime. This study quantified the seasonal variation in
   the thermal performance of several coral and symbiont-dominated
   physiological traits for the thermally tolerant coral species Porites
   cylindrica and the thermally sensitive coral species Acropora
   valenciennesi. Photosynthesis rates, respiration rates, maximum
   photosystem II (PSII) quantum yield and electron transport rates were
   measured in winter and summer on coral fragments exposed to an acute
   temperature increase and decrease up to 5 degrees C above and below the
   average seawater temperature in each season. Results showed that
   colonies of A. valenciennesi acclimated primarily by shifting their
   optimal temperature to a higher temperature in summer, whereas colonies
   of P. cylindrica had broader thermal breadth during summer. For
   symbionts within both species, performance was higher at all
   temperatures in summer, while the thermal optima and performance breadth
   remained unchanged. Despite these changes in thermal performance, the
   thermal optima of most traits did not match the ambient environmental
   temperature, but fell between the summer and winter temperatures.
   Overall, these results showed that both coral species were
   physiologically plastic in response to temperature change, but that
   there are constraints on the rate or capacity for acclimation that
   prevent a perfect match between the average temperature of the
   environment and the thermal optimum of the species.},

Abstract = {Interpretation of carbon isotope records from late Quaternary planktonic
   foraminifers are confounded due to the presence of a significant
   physiological component in the carbon isotopic signal. A quantitative
   carbon isotope (QC) model is presented which relates the carbon isotopic
   composition of a foraminiferal shell to the physiological processes of
   respiration and symbiont photosynthesis and to the delta C-13 value of
   seawater Sigma CO2. T he QC model is calibrated with physiological and
   stable isotopic data from laboratory experiments with living planktonic
   foraminifers. Model simulations of chamber and shell delta C-13 values
   with the symbiont-bearing foraminifers, Orbulina universa and
   Globigerinoides sacculifer, suggest (1) variations in symbiont density
   and photosynthetic rate (light level or habitat depth) are the primary
   physiological parameters controlling intraspecific carbon isotopic
   variability in these species, (2) respiration has little effect on the
   delta C-13 of O. universa, and (3) each chamber in a multichambered
   foraminiferal test will have a distinct value depending on its position

Title = {Climate change promotes parasitism in a coral symbiosis},
Journal = {ISME JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Coastal oceans are increasingly eutrophic, warm and acidic through the
   addition of anthropogenic nitrogen and carbon, respectively. Among the
   most sensitive taxa to these changes are scleractinian corals, which
   engineer the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth. Corals' sensitivity is
   a consequence of their evolutionary investment in symbiosis with the
   dinoflagellate alga, Symbiodinium. Together, the coral holobiont has
   dominated oligotrophic tropical marine habitats. However, warming
   destabilizes this association and reduces coral fitness. It has been
   theorized that, when reefs become warm and eutrophic, mutualistic
   Symbiodinium sequester more resources for their own growth, thus
   parasitizing their hosts of nutrition. Here, we tested the hypothesis
   that sub- bleaching temperature and excess nitrogen promotes symbiont
   parasitism by measuring respiration (costs) and the assimilation and
   translocation of both carbon (energy) and nitrogen (growth; both
   benefits) within Orbicella faveolata hosting one of two Symbiodinium
   phylotypes using a dual stable isotope tracer incubation at ambient (26
   degrees C) and sub- bleaching (31 degrees C) temperatures under elevated
   nitrate. Warming to 31 degrees C reduced holobiont net primary
   productivity (NPP) by 60\% due to increased respiration which decreased
   host \% carbon by 15\% with no apparent cost to the symbiont.
   Concurrently, Symbiodinium carbon and nitrogen assimilation increased by
   14 and 32\%, respectively while increasing their mitotic index by 15\%,
   whereas hosts did not gain a proportional increase in translocated
   photosynthates. We conclude that the disparity in benefits and costs to
   both partners is evidence of symbiont parasitism in the coral symbiosis
   and has major implications for the resilience of coral reefs under
   threat of global change.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {The absorbtion of human-emitted CO2 by the oceans (elevated P-CO2) is
   projected to alter the physiological performance of coral reef organisms
   by perturbing seawater chemistry (i.e. ocean acidification).
   Simultaneously, greenhouse gas emissions are driving ocean warming and
   changes in irradiance (through turbidity and cloud cover), which have
   the potential to influence the effects of ocean acidification on coral
   reefs. Here, we explored whether physiological impacts of elevated
   P-CO2, on a coral-algal symbiosis (Pocillopora acuta-Symbiodiniaceae)
   are mediated by light and/or temperature levels. In a 39 day experiment,
   elevated P-CO2 (962 versus 431 patm P-CO2) had an interactive effect
   with midday light availability (400 versus 800 pmol photons m(-2) s(-1))
   and temperature (25 versus 29 degrees C) on areal gross and net
   photosynthesis, for which a decline at 29 degrees C was ameliorated
   under simultaneous high-Pm and high-light conditions. Light-enhanced
   dark respiration increased under elevated P-CO2 and/or elevated
   temperature. Symbiont to host cell ratio and chlorophyll a per symbiont
   increased at elevated temperature, whilst symbiont areal density
   decreased. The ability of moderately strong light in the presence of
   elevated P-CO2 to alleviate the temperature-induced decrease in
   photosynthesis suggests that higher substrate availability facilitates a
   greater ability for photochemical quenching, partially offsetting the
   impacts of high temperature on the photosynthetic apparatus. Future
   environmental changes that result in moderate increases in light levels
   could therefore assist the P. acuta holobiont to cope with the `one-two
   punch' of rising temperatures in the presence of an acidifying ocean.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to test whether elevated pCO(2)

   Seriatopora caliendrum (Ehrenberg 1834) either independently or
   interactively with high temperature (30.5 A degrees C). Response
   variables detected the sequence of events associated with the onset of
   bleaching: reduction in the photosynthetic performance of symbionts as
   measured by maximum photochemical efficiency (F (v)/F (m)) and effective
   photochemical efficiency (Delta F/F (m)') of PSII, declines in net
   photosynthesis (P (net)) and photosynthetic efficiency (alpha, alpha),
   and finally, reduced chlorophyll a and symbiont concentrations. S.
   caliendrum was collected from Nanwan Bay, Taiwan, and subjected to
   combinations of temperature (27.7 vs. 30.5 A degrees C) and pCO(2) (45.1
   vs. 85.1 Pa) for 14 days. High temperature reduced values of all
   dependent variables (i.e., bleaching occurred), but high pCO(2) did not
   affect Symbiodinium photophysiology or productivity, and did not cause
   bleaching. These results suggest that short-term exposure to 81.5 Pa

Abstract = {Coral cell cultures made from reef-building scleractinian corals have
   the potential to aid in the pursuit of understanding of the

   for supporting the use of coral explants as laboratory models for
   studying coral symbioses. In particular, it highlights how these small,

Title = {Caribbean scleractinian corals exhibit highly variable tolerances to
   acute hypoxia},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAY 17},
Abstract = {IntroductionClimate change, and the increase in sea surface temperature,
   is exacerbating ocean deoxygenation because of the inherent property of
   seawater to sequester less dissolved gas, such as oxygen, at warmer
   temperatures. While most coral reef studies focus on the effects of
   thermal stress and ocean acidification, few studies acknowledge the
   threat of hypoxia. Hypoxia is traditionally defined as 6.3 kPa (2 mg L-1
   O2), however, a universal hypoxia threshold is not useful given the vast
   range of responses among marine organisms. The range of metabolic
   responses and tolerances to hypoxia are unknown for Caribbean coral
   species and their algal symbionts. ObjectiveHere, we quantified the
   spectrum of acute hypoxia tolerances and the range of metabolic
   responses of six ecologically and structurally important Caribbean coral
   species (Acropora cervicornis, Siderastrea radians, Siderastrea siderea,
   Porites astreoides, Porites porites, and Orbicella faveolata) and their
   algal symbionts (Symbiodinium, Breviolum, and Durusdinium spp.).
   MethodsA total of 24 coral fragments (4 individuals per species) were
   exposed to 10 distinct oxygen concentrations ranging from normoxia
   (20.38 kPa) to severe hypoxia (3.3 kPa). We used intermittent flow
   respirometry to measure coral host respiration in the dark and algal
   symbiont photosynthesis in the light at each oxygen level. We determined
   a line of best fit for the metabolic rate vs. PO2 data and calculated
   the critical oxygen partial pressure (PO2 crit), a method that has not
   been tested on symbiotic species. ResultsCoral species and their algal
   symbionts measured here displayed a wide range of hypoxia tolerances.
   For the coral hosts, PO2 crit values differed roughly two-fold ranging
   from 5.74 kPa to 16.93 kPa, and for the algal symbionts, PO2 crit values
   differed roughly three-fold ranging from 3.9 kPa to 11.3 kPa.
   DiscussionThese results should be regarded as a first step to
   characterizing the metabolic response and acute tolerance of multiple
   coral hosts and algal symbionts to a wide range of oxygen
   concentrations. Given that some PO2 crit values were above the generally
   accepted hypoxia threshold, these results have implications for the
   community composition of reefs under a rapidly changing climate and can
   guide purposeful reef restoration.},

Abstract = {Changes in the seawater carbonate chemistry (ocean acidification) from
   increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations negatively
   affect many marine calcifying organisms, but may benefit primary
   producers under dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) limitation. To improve
   predictions of the ecological effects of ocean acidification, the net
   gains and losses between the processes of photosynthesis and
   calcification need to be studied jointly on physiological and population
   levels. We studied productivity, respiration, and abundances of the
   symbiont-bearing foraminifer species Marginopora vertebralis on natural
   CO2 seeps in Papua New Guinea and conducted additional studies on
   production and calcification on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) using
   artificially enhanced pCO2. Net oxygen production increased up to 90\%
   with increasing pCO2; temperature, light, and pH together explaining
   61\% of the variance in production. Production increased with increasing
   light and increasing pCO2 and declined at higher temperatures.
   Respiration was also significantly elevated (similar to 25\%), whereas
   calcification was reduced (1639\%) at low pH/high pCO2 compared to
   present-day conditions. In the field, M. vertebralis was absent at three
   CO2 seep sites at pHTotal levels below similar to 7.9 (pCO2 similar to
   700 similar to mu atm), but it was found in densities of over 1000
   similar to m-2 at all three control sites. The study showed that
   endosymbiotic algae in foraminifera benefit from increased DIC
   availability and may be naturally carbon limited. The observed reduction
   in calcification may have been caused either by increased energy demands
   for proton pumping (measured as elevated rates of respiration) or by
   stronger competition for DIC from the more productive symbionts. The net
   outcome of these two competing processes is that M. vertebralis cannot
   maintain populations under pCO2 exceeding 700 similar to mu atm, thus
   are likely to be extinct in the next century.},

Abstract = {The successful dispersal of coral larvae is vital to the population
   replenishment and reef recovery and resilience. De -spite that this
   critical early stage is susceptible to ocean warming and acidification,
   little is known about the responses of coral larvae to warming and
   acidification across different biological scales. This study explored
   the influences of el-evated temperature (29 ? versus 33 ?) and pCO2 (500
   mu atm versus 1000 mu atm) on brooded larvae of Pocillopora damicornis
   at the organismal, cellular and gene expression levels. Heat stress
   caused bleaching, depressed light-enhanced dark respiration,
   photosynthesis and autotrophy, whereas high pCO(2) stimulated
   photosynthesis. Although survival was unaffected, larvae at 33 ? were
   ten-times more likely to settle than those at 29 ?, suggesting reduced
   capacity to disperse and differentiate suitable substrate. Remarkably,
   heat stress induced greater symbiont loss at am -bient pCO(2) than at
   high pCO(2), while cell-specific pigment concentrations of symbionts at
   33 \& DEG;C increased twofold under ambient pCO2 relative to high pCO(2)
   suggesting pCO(2)-dependent bleaching patterns. Considerable increases
   in activities of host antioxidants superoxide dismutase (SOD) and
   catalase (CAT) at 33 ? indicated oxidative stress, whereas lipid
   peroxidation and caspase activities were contained, thereby restraining
   larval mortality at 33 ?. Fur -thermore, the coral host mounted stronger
   transcriptional responses than symbionts. High pCO(2) stimulated host
   met-abolic pathways, possibly because of the boosted algal productivity.
   In contrast, host metabolic processes and symbiont photosystem genes
   were downregulated at 33 ?. Interestingly, the upregulation of
   extracellular matrix genes and glycosaminoglycan degradation pathway at
   33 ? was more evident under ambient pCO(2) than high pCO(2), suggesting
   compromised host tissue integrity that could have facilitated symbiont
   expulsion and bleaching. Our results provide insights into how coral
   larvae respond to warming and acidification at different levels of
   biological organization, and demonstrate that ocean acidification can
   mediate thermal bleaching and gene expression in coral larvae under heat
   stress.},

Abstract = {In this paper I challenge the notion that a healthy and resilient coral
   is (in all cases) a fast-growing coral, and by inference, that a reef
   characterised by a fast trajectory toward high coral cover is
   necessarily a healthy and resilient reef. Instead, I explain how
   emerging evidence links fast skeletal extension rates with elevated
   coral-algae (symbiotic) respiration rates, most-often mediated by
   nutrient-enlarged symbiont populations and/or rising sea temperatures.
   Elevated respiration rates can act to reduce the autotrophic capacity
   (photosynthesis:respiration ratio) of the symbiosis. This restricts the
   capacity of the coral host to build and maintain sufficient energy
   reserves (e.g. lipids) needed to sustain essential homeostatic
   functions, including sexual reproduction and biophysical stress
   resistance. Moreover, it explains the somewhat paradoxical scenario,
   whereby at the ecological instant before the reef-building capacity of
   the symbiosis is lost, a reef can look visually at its best and be
   accreting CaCO3 at its maximum.},

Abstract = {Thermal priming of reef corals can enhance their heat tolerance;
   however, the legacy effects of heat stress during parental brooding on
   larval resilience remain understudied. This study investigated whether
   preconditioning adult coral Pocillopora damicornis to high temperatures
   (29 degrees C and 32 degrees C) could better prepare their larvae for
   heat stress. Results showed that heat-acclimated adults brooded larvae
   with reduced symbiont density and shifted thermal performance curves.
   Reciprocal transplant experiments demonstrated higher bleaching
   resistance and better photosynthetic and autotrophic performance in
   heat-exposed larvae from acclimated adults compared to unacclimated
   adults. RNA-seq revealed strong cellular stress responses in larvae from
   heat-acclimated adults that could have been effective in rescuing host
   cells from stress, as evidenced by the widespread upregulation of genes
   involved in cell cycle and mitosis. For symbionts, a molecular
   coordination between light harvesting, photoprotection and carbon
   fixation was detected in larvae from heat-acclimated adults, which may
   help optimize photosynthetic activity and yield under high temperature.
   Furthermore, heat acclimation led to opposing regulations of symbiont
   catabolic and anabolic pathways and favoured nutrient translocation to
   the host and thus a functional symbiosis. Notwithstanding, the improved
   heat tolerance was paralleled by reduced light-enhanced dark
   respiration, indicating metabolic depression for energy saving. Our
   findings suggest that adult heat acclimation can rapidly shift thermal
   tolerance of brooded coral larvae and provide integrated physiological
   and molecular evidence for this adaptive plasticity, which could
   increase climate resilience. However, the metabolic depression may be
   maladaptive for long-term organismal performance, highlighting the
   importance of curbing carbon emissions to better protect corals.},

   occurred between noon and 18:00h. Growth and dieback events often
   occurred simultaneously and were tightly coupled with soil temperature
   and moisture, suggesting a rapid acclimation of the external phase of AM
   fungi to the immediate environment. Changes in the environmental

Abstract = {The nutritional symbiosis between coral hosts and photosynthetic
   dinoflagellates is fundamental to the functioning of coral reefs. Rising
   seawater temperatures destabilize this relationship, resulting in
   drastic declines in world-wide coral cover. Thermal history is thought
   to play an important role in shaping a coral's response to subsequent
   thermal stress. Here, we exposed Pocillopora damicomis to two thermal
   acclimation regimes (ambient vs. warm) and compared the effect that
   acclimation had on the coral holobiont's response to a subsequent seven
   day heat stress event. We conducted daily physiological measurements at
   the holobiont level (gross photosynthesis, respiration, host protein
   content, symbiont density and chlorophyll content) throughout the
   heating event, as well as cellular-level imaging of C-13-bicarbonate and
   N-15-nitrate assimilation (using NanoSIMS) at the end of the heat stress
   event. Thermal acclimation history had a negligible effect on the
   measurements conducted at the holobiont level during the heat stress
   event. No differences were observed in the O-2-budget between ambient
   and warm-acclimated corals and only small fluctuations in host protein,
   symbiont density and chlorophyll content were detected. In contrast,
   this lack of differential response, was not mirrored at the cellular
   level. Warm-acclimated corals had substantially higher C-13 enrichment
   in the host gastrodermis and lipid bodies, but significantly lower
   N-15-nitrate assimilation in the symbionts and the host tissue layers,
   relative to the ambient-acclimated corals. We discuss potential reasons
   for the disconnect that occurred between symbiont bicarbonate and
   nitrate assimilation (in the absence of photosynthetic breakdown) in the
   warm-acclimated corals. We suggest this represents either a shift in
   nitrogen utilization, or supply limitation by the host. Our findings
   raise several interesting hypotheses regarding the role that nitrogen
   metabolism plays in thermal stress, which will warrant further
   investigation if we are to understand the acclimatization capacity of
   the coral holobiont.},

Abstract = {Marine ecosystems, particularly coastal environments, are rapidly
   changing due to anthropogenic impacts resulting in increased global
   climate change (ocean warming), ocean acidification, hypoxia, and
   eutrophication. On coral reefs, symbiont-bearing large benthic
   foraminifera (LBFs) can play a key role as reef constituents and
   carbonate producers, contributing up to 5\% of reef-scale carbonate
   budgets. However, projected climate change, particularly ocean warming,
   has the potential to significantly alter the conditions in which marine
   organisms persist. While the response of LBFs to elevated thermal stress
   is well documented in laboratory studies, the potential influence of
   adaptation or acclimatization through prior environmental thermal
   history on this response remains largely unknown. In this study,
   specimens of Calcarina gaudichaudii, an LBF from the Penghu Islands,
   Taiwan, were collected from thermally variable intertidal and thermally
   stable subtidal (similar to 6 m depth) environments representing thermal
   history. LBFs were then acclimated to laboratory conditions at ambient
   (25 degrees C) and elevated (28 degrees C) temperatures for three weeks,
   and subsequently exposed to control and heat stress treatments (25
   degrees C, 28 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 33 degrees C) for an additional
   one week. Photosynthetic rates (determined through oxygen flux
   measurements) of C. gaudichaudii significantly decreased in specimens
   collected at subtidal depths acclimated at 25 degrees C when compared to
   those acclimated at 28 degrees C, whereas there was no effect of thermal
   history on respiration, indicating that symbiont and holobiont responses
   may differ in LBFs. Additionally, maximum photochemical efficiency
   (Fv/Fm) significantly decreased as a result of heat stress, although
   bleaching was not visually observed after one week. These results
   highlight the plastic responses of the algal microbiome and indicate
   that thermal history, acclimatization temperature, and heat stress
   interact to affect the physiological status of C. gaudichaudii. This
   study adds to the growing literature which highlights the larger
   implications of understanding thermal history as an important factor to
   consider to better understand how ecosystem processes (e.g., carbonate
   production) are altered on modern coral reefs.},

Abstract = {Enhancing the resilience of corals to rising temperatures is now a
   matter of urgency, leading to growing efforts to explore the use of heat
   tolerant symbiont species to improve their thermal resilience. The
   notion that adaptive traits can be retained by transferring the
   symbionts alone, however, challenges the holobiont concept, a
   fundamental paradigm in coral research. Holobiont traits are products of
   a specific community (holobiont) and all its co-evolutionary and local
   adaptations, which might limit the retention or transference of
   holobiont traits by exchanging only one partner. Here we evaluate how
   interchanging partners affect the short- and long-term performance of
   holobionts under heat stress using clonal lineages of the cnidarian
   model system Aiptasia (host and Symbiodiniaceae strains) originating
   from distinct thermal environments. Our results show that holobionts
   from more thermally variable environments have higher plasticity to heat
   stress, but this resilience could not be transferred to other host
   genotypes through the exchange of symbionts. Importantly, our findings
   highlight the role of the host in determining holobiont productivity in
   response to thermal stress and indicate that local adaptations of
   holobionts will likely limit the efficacy of interchanging unfamiliar
   compartments to enhance thermal tolerance.},

Abstract = {PremiseThe long-term potential for acclimation by lichens to changing
   climates is poorly known, despite their prominent roles in forested
   ecosystems. Although often considered ``extremophiles,{''} lichens may
   not readily acclimate to novel climates well beyond historical norms. In
   a previous study (Smith et al., 2018), Evernia mesomorpha transplants in
   a whole-ecosystem climate change experiment showed drastic mass loss
   after 1 yr of warming and drying; however, the causes of this mass loss
   were not addressed. MethodsWe examined the causes of this
   warming-induced mass loss by measuring physiological, functional, and
   reproductive attributes of lichen transplants. ResultsSevere loss of
   mass and physiological function occurred above +2 degrees C of
   experimental warming. Loss of algal symbionts ({''}bleaching{''}) and
   turnover in algal community compositions increased with temperature and
   were the clearest impacts of experimental warming. Enhanced CO2 had no
   significant physiological or symbiont composition effects. The
   functional loss of algal photobionts led to significant loss of mass and
   specific thallus mass (STM), which in turn reduced water-holding
   capacity (WHC). Although algal genotypes remained detectable in thalli
   exposed to higher stress, within-thallus photobiont communities shifted
   in composition toward greater diversity. ConclusionsThe strong negative
   impacts of warming and/or lower humidity on Evernia mesomorpha were
   driven by a loss of photobiont activity. Analogous to the effects of
   climate change on corals, the balance of symbiont carbon metabolism in
   lichens is central to their resilience to changing conditions.},

Abstract = {Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are becoming more frequent as a consequence of
   climate change. These discrete events are causing widespread stress and
   mortality in marine ecosystems, including coral reefs. The heat
   tolerance of different coral species is often complex and depends on a
   combination of environmental and biological factors, making accurate
   predictions of the impact of MHWs on individual species challenging.
   Heating rate has been shown to influence coral bleaching in Acropora
   species, but it remains unknown how heating rate influences bleaching in
   other corals with contrasting morphology and bleaching sensitivities. In
   this study, we explored the sensitivity of Pocillopora damicornis and
   Plesiastrea versipora, representing branching and encrusting growth
   forms, respectively, to heating rate. We experimentally simulated MHWs
   with slow (0.5 degrees C d-1) and fast (1 degrees C d-1) heating rates
   and measured physiological responses to quantify changes in coral
   health, including photochemical efficiency, holobiont metabolism, tissue
   biomass, chl a, and symbiont density. Our results confirm that heating
   rate is a good predictor of coral bleaching sensitivity for these
   species, with faster heating rates causing more severe bleaching and
   declines in coral health. However, bleaching sensitivity differed
   between P. damicornis and P. versipora, with P. damicornis more affected
   by the faster heating rate. The use of heating rate, in addition to
   other metrics such as duration and intensity of heat, will enhance our
   capacity to predict the local impact of MHW events and their overarching
   ecological consequences for coral ecosystems.},

Abstract = {In order for sessile organisms to survive environmental fluctuations and
   exposures to pollutants, molecular mechanisms (i.e. stress responses)
   are elicited. Previously, detrimental effects of natural and
   anthropogenic stressors on coral health could not be ascertained until
   significant physiological responses resulted in visible signs of stress
   (e.g. tissue necrosis, bleaching). In this study, a focused. anthozoan
   holobiont microarray was used to detect early and sub-lethal effects of
   spatial and temporal environmental changes on gene expression patterns
   in the scleractinian coral, Montastraea cavernosa, on south Florida
   reefs. Although all colonies appeared healthy (i.e. no visible tissue
   necrosis or bleaching), corals were differentially physiologically
   compensating for exposure to stressors that varied over time. Corals
   near the Port of Miami inlet experienced significant changes in
   expression of stress responsive and symbiont (zooxanthella)-specific
   genes after periods of heavy precipitation. In contrast, coral
   populations did not demonstrate stress responses during periods of
   increased water temperature (up to 29 degrees C). Specific acute and
   long-term localized responses to other stressors were also evident. A
   correlation between stress response genes and symbiont-specific genes
   was also observed, possibly indicating early processes involved in the
   maintenance or disruption of the coral zooxanthella symbiosis. This is
   the first study to reveal spatially- and temporally-related variation in
   gene expression in response to different stressors of in situ coral
   populations, and demonstrates that microarray technology can be used to
   detect specific sub-lethal physiological responses to specific
   environmental conditions that are not visually detectable. (c) 2012

Abstract = {Corals are relatively stenothermic organisms and highly sensitive to
   thermal stress. To understand how heating rate modulates the holobiont
   response to thermal challenge, we compared the effects of acute heat
   shock and cumulative thermal exposures on Acropora cervicornis from
   Southeast Florida (26 degrees 06 N, 80 degrees 05 W). In March of 2017,
   maximum dark-adapted yield of photosystem II (F-V/F-M), rates of dark
   respiration (R), and rates of gross photosynthesis (P-g) were measured
   at temperatures spanning 25-36 degrees C. Thermal performance curves of
   each response variable were constructed as a function of temperature and
   thermal dose (i.e., degree heating minutes). Acute exposure (i.e.,
   instantaneously increasing temperature by between 2.5 and 10 degrees C)
   resulted in a more marked decline in physiology despite a lower thermal
   dose, compared to the cumulative exposure (2.5 degrees C h(-1)).
   Apparent deficits in coral holobiont metabolism were observed as a
   function of both temperature and thermal dose, but examination of
   holobiont metabolism in a dose-context revealed more pronounced
   differences between acute and cumulative exposures. Subtle physiological
   differences may be more easily identified and better cross-study
   comparisons of cnidarian thermal tolerance may be achieved by placing
   temperature exposures in degree heating times. In addition, the ratio of
   daily P-g:R fell below 1 when temperatures exceeded 32 degrees C,
   corroborating prior observations that P-g:R may be a means of
   identifying physiological deficits in advance of visual signs of
   dysbiosis, such as bleaching.},

Abstract = {The intertidal sea anemone Anthopleura egantissima contains two
   symbiotic algae, zoochlorellae and zooxanthellae, in the Northern Puget
   Sound region. Possible nutritional advantages to hosting one algal
   symbiont over the other were explored by comparing the photosynthetic
   and carbon translocation rates of both symbionts under different
   environmental conditions. Each alga translocated 30\% of
   photosynthetically fixed carbon in freshly collected anemones, although
   zoochlorellae fixed and translocated less carbon than zooxanthellae. The
   total amount of carbon translocated to the host was equivalent because
   densities of zoochlorellae were two to three times greater than were
   densities of zooxanthellae. In A. elegantissima maintained under high
   and low irradiance (100 and 10 mu mol photons/m(2)/s) at 20 degrees C
   and 13 degrees C for 21 days, bath algae fixed and translocated carbon
   at greater rates at 20 degrees C (translocation rates: 0,38 pg C
   /zoochlorella/h; 1.12 pg C /zooxanthella/h) than at 13 degrees C
   (translocation rates: 0.06 pg C /zoochlorella/h; 0.37 pg C
   /zooxanthella/h), However, zoochlorellate anemones received 3.5 times
   less carbon at 20 degrees C than at 13 degrees C because the higher
   temperature caused a significant reduction in the density of
   zoochlorellae. Environmental variables, Like temperature, that influence
   the densities of the two symbionts will affect their relative
   nutritional contribution to the host. Whether these differences in
   carbon translocation rates of the two algal symbionts affect the ecology
   of their anemone host awaits further investigation.},

Title = {Quantitative interpretation of vertical profiles of calcium and pH in
   the coral coelenteron},
Journal = {MARINE CHEMISTRY},

Volume = {204},

Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {Scleratinian corals (hard corals) and their symbiotic algae are the
   ecological engineers of biodiverse and geological important coral reef
   habitats. The complex, linked physiological processes that enable the
   holobiont (coral + algae) to calcify and generate reef structures are
   consequently of great interest. However, the mechanism of calcification
   is difficult to study for several reasons including the small spatial
   scales of the processes and the close coupling between the symbiont and
   host. In this study, we explore the utility of pH and Ca2+
   microelectrodes for constraining the rates and spatial distribution of
   photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification. The work focuses on
   vertical profiles of pH and Ca2+ through the coelenteron cavity, a
   semi-isolated compartment of modified seawater amenable to quantitative
   interpretation. In two studied species, Turbincuia reniformis and
   Acropora nallepora, Ca2+ concentrations decreased in a roughly linear
   manner from the mouth to the base of the coelenteron, indicating the
   primary physiological process affecting Ca2+ concentration is removal
   for calcification below the coelenteron. In contrast, the H+
   concentration remained relatively constant over much of the coelenteron
   cavity before it increased sharply toward the base of the coelenteron,
   indicative of proton-pumping from the calcification fluid below. The
   estimated H+ gradient between the coelenteron cavity and the
   calcification site was > 10 times higher than previously predicted.
   Consequently, the energy required to export protons from the calcifying
   fluid was estimated to be similar to 3 times higher than previously
   calculated. A one-dimensional reaction-diffusion model was used to
   interpret the pH profile considering the effects of photosynthesis,
   respiration, and calcification. This model provided a good fit to the
   observed pH profile and helped to constrain the rates and spatial
   distribution of these processes. Our modeling results also suggested
   that adult corals with deeper polyps may be more sensitive to ocean
   acidification (OA) because of enhanced difficulty to transport H+ out of
   the coelenteron and into the surrounding seawater.},

Volume = {40},

Abstract = {Temperate organisms are generally exposed to a more variable and cooler
   climate than tropical organisms, and are therefore expected to have
   broader thermal tolerance and a different thermal performance curve.
   This study investigated these hypotheses by comparing the thermal
   performance of two common tropical coral species found in the Great
   Barrier Reef with the two most common temperate coral species from the
   Mediterranean Sea. Photosynthesis rates, dark respiration rates, maximum
   PSII quantum yield (F-v/F-m) and electron transport rates (rETR(m)) were
   measured on coral fragments exposed to an acute temperature increase and
   decrease up to 5 degrees C above and below the average environmental
   seawater temperature. Dark respiration rates and F-v/F-m increased
   linearly with temperature, suggesting broad thermal tolerance. For
   photosynthesis and rETR(m), the performance breadths were surprisingly
   similar between the tropical and temperate species. However, the thermal
   optimum for performance was generally below the local average
   temperature, and only coincided with the prevailing environmental
   temperature for one of the tropical species. The broad thermal tolerance
   for photosynthesis displayed in this study supports previous
   observations that corals can survive short periods of abnormally warm
   temperatures and suggests that corals adopt thermal generalist
   strategies to cope with temperature variation in the environment.
   Nevertheless, current mean temperatures are 10-30\% above the thermal
   optimum for the species studied here, demonstrating that conditions are
   already pushing the boundaries of coral thermal tolerance.},

Abstract = {Stable oxygen and carbon isotope measurements on biogenic calcite and
   aragonite have become standard tools for reconstructing past
   oceanographic and climatic change. In aquatic organisms, O-18/O-16
   ratios in the shell carbonate are a function of the ratio in the sea
   water and the calcification temperature(1). In contrast, C-13/C-12
   ratios are controlled by the ratio of dissolved inorganic carbon in sea
   water and physiological processes such as respiration and symbiont
   photosynthesis', These geochemical proxies have been used with analyses
   of foraminifera shells to reconstruct global ice volumes(3), surface and
   deep ocean temperatures(4,5), ocean circulation changes(6) and
   glacial-interglacial exchange between the terrestrial and oceanic carbon
   pools(7). Here, we report experimental measurements on living symbiotic
   and non-symbiotic plankton foraminifera (Orbulina universa and
   Globigerina bulloides respectively) showing that the C-13/C-12 and
   O-18/O-16 ratios of the calcite shells decrease with increasing seawater
   {[}CO32-]. Because glacial-period oceans had higher pH and {[}CO32-]
   than today(8), these new relationships confound the standard
   interpretation of glacial foraminiferal stable-isotope data In
   particular, the hypothesis that the glacial-interglacial shift in the
   C-13/C-12 ratio was due to a transfer of terrestrial carbon into the
   ocean(7) can be explained alternatively by an increase in ocean
   alkalinity(25). A carbonate-concentration effect could also help explain
   some of the extreme stable-isotope variations during the Proterozoic and
   Phanerozoic aeons(9).},

Title = {Individual and combined effect of organic eutrophication (DOC) and ocean

Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) enrichment and ocean warming both
   negatively affect hard corals, but studies on their combined effects on
   other reef organisms are scarce. Octocorals are likely to become key
   players in future reef communities, but they are still highly
   under-investigated with regard to their responses to global and local
   environmental changes. Thus, we evaluated the individual and combined
   effects of DOC enrichment (10, 20 and 40 mg L(-)1 DOC, added as glucose)
   and warming (stepwise from 26 to 32 degrees C) on the widespread
   Indo-Pacific gorgonian Pinnigorgia flava in a 45-day laboratory
   experiment. Oxygen fluxes (net photosynthesis and respiration), as well
   as Symbiodiniaceae cell density and coral growth were assessed. Our
   results highlight a differential ecophysiological response to DOC
   enrichment and warming as well as their combination. Individual DOC
   addition did not significantly affect oxygen fluxes nor Symbiodiniaceae
   cell density and growth, while warming significantly decreased
   photosynthesis rates and Symbiodiniaceae cell density. When DOC
   enrichment and warming were combined, no effect on P. flava oxygen
   fluxes was observed while growth responded to certain DOC conditions
   depending on the temperature. Our findings indicate that P. flava is
   insensitive to the individual effect of DOC enrichment, but not to
   warming and the two stressors combined. This suggests that, if
   temperature remains below certain thresholds, this gorgonian species may
   gain a competitive advantage over coral species that are reportedly more
   affected by DOC eutrophication. However, under the expected increasing
   temperature scenarios, it is also likely that this octocoral species
   will be negatively affected, with potential consequences on community
   structure. This study contributes to our understanding of the conditions
   that drive phase shift dynamics in coastal coral reef ecosystemds.},

   usually displayed the opposite trend. The results show that corals from
   all depths exhibited bleaching (loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates and/or
   their pigments) every year, regardless of whether they appeared white,

Abstract = {In situ and laboratory experiments conducted over the past quarter of a
   century have greatly increased our understanding of the ecology of
   deep-sea hydrothermal systems. Early experiments suggested that
   chemosynthetic primary production constituted the principal source of
   organic matter for biological communities associated with vents,
   although subsequent studies have revealed many complexities associated
   with interactions between microbes and higher organisms inhabiting these
   ecosystems. A diversity of host-microbial symbiont relationships has
   been identified and experimental studies have revealed the exquisite
   physiological adaptations within the giant tubeworm, Riftia pachyptila,
   for the uptake, fixation, and assimilation of carbon. In vitro
   experiments demonstrated the unusual sulfide binding properties of
   tubeworm hemoglobin that prevent inhibition of the cytochrome-c oxidase
   enzyme system during transport of sulfide to symbiont-bearing tissues.
   Studies of respiration and growth of several species of vent organisms
   conducted over the past two decades transformed earlier views that low
   metabolism and slow growth are characteristics of all organisms
   inhabiting all deep-sea environments. Results of recent experiments
   suggest that metabolic rates correlate with the degree of mobility of
   the organisms rather than with any specific attribute of the deep-sea
   environment itself, and growth rates of certain vent organisms (e.g., R.
   pachyptila) were found to be among the highest in any marine
   environments. While extreme thermal tolerance has been suggested as
   characteristic of certain vent fauna (e.g., alvinellid polychaetes and
   alvinocarid shrimp), the majority of vent metazoans live at temperatures
   below 20 degreesC and additional experiments are necessary to reconcile
   field experiments documenting thermal tolerance in situ, thermal
   tolerance in vivo, and thermal sensitivity of biochemical constituents
   of vent organisms. Transplantation and clearance experiments, as well as
   in situ characterization of vent fluid chemistry, have greatly increased
   our understanding of organism-environment interactions. Early analyses
   of metazoan egg size and larval morphology, coupled with in vivo larval
   culture experiments, available physical oceanographic data, and genetic
   studies of gene flow, have contributed greatly to our understanding of
   mechanisms of dispersal between widely separated vent sites. The
   documentation of invertebrate colonization and succession of new vents
   following a volcanic eruption, and a series of manipulative field
   experiments, provide considerable insights into the relative roles of
   abiotic conditions and biotic interactions in structuring vent
   communities. Recent and emerging technological developments, such as in
   situ chemical analyzers, observatory approaches, and laboratory-based
   pressure culture systems, should provide invaluable new experimental
   tools for tackling many remaining questions concerning the ecology of
   deep-sea hydrothermal systems. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Climate change threatens coral survival by causing coral bleaching,
   which occurs when the coral's symbiotic relationship with algal
   symbionts (Symbiodiniaceae) breaks down. Studies on thermal adaptation
   focus on symbionts because they are accessible both in vitro and in
   hospite. However, there is little known about the physiological and
   biochemical response of adult corals (without Symbiodiniaceae) to
   thermal stress. Here we show acclimatization and/or adaptation potential
   of menthol-bleached aposymbiotic coral Platygyra verweyi in terms of
   respiration breakdown temperature (RBT) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH)
   enzyme activity in samples collected from two reef sites with
   contrasting temperature regimes: a site near a nuclear power plant
   outlet (NPP-OL, with long-term temperature perturbation) and Wanlitong
   (WLT) in southern Taiwan. Aposymbiotic P. verweyi from the NPP-OL site
   had a 3.1 degrees C higher threshold RBT than those from WLT. In
   addition, MDH activity in P. verweyi from NPP-OL showed higher thermal
   resistance than those from WLT by higher optimum temperatures and the
   activation energy required for inactivating the enzyme by heat. The MDH
   from NPP-OL also had two times higher residual activity than that from
   WLT after incubation at 50 degrees C for 1 h. The results of RBT and
   thermal properties of MDH in P. verweyi demonstrate potential
   physiological and enzymatic response to a long-term and regular thermal

   investigated the combined effects of elevated sea surface temperatures
   and pCO(2) on two species of photosymbiont-bearing coral reef
   Foraminifera: Heterostegina depressa (hosting diatoms) and Marginopora
   vertebralis (hosting dinoflagellates). The effects of single and
   combined stressors were studied by monitoring survivorship, growth, and
   physiological parameters, such as respiration, photochemistry (pulse
   amplitude modulation fluorometry and oxygen production), and chl a
   content. Specimens were exposed in flow-through aquaria for up to seven
   weeks to combinations of two pCO(2) (similar to 790 and similar to 490 A
   mu atm) and two temperature (28 and 31 A degrees C) regimes. Elevated
   temperature had negative effects on the physiology of both species.
   Elevated pCO(2) had negative effects on growth and apparent
   photosynthetic rate in H.depressa but a positive effect on effective
   quantum yield. With increasing pCO(2), chl a content decreased in H.
   depressa and increased in M. vertebralis. The strongest stress responses
   were observed when the two stressors acted in combination. An
   interaction term was statistically significant in half of the measured
   parameters. Further exploration revealed that 75 \% of these cases
   showed a synergistic (= larger than additive) interaction between the
   two stressors. These results indicate that negative physiological
   effects on photosymbiont-bearing coral reef Foraminifera are likely to
   be stronger under simultaneous acidification and temperature rise than
   what would be expected from the effect of each of the stressors

Abstract = {Stable endosymbiotic relationships between cnidarian animals and
   dinoflagellate algae are vital for sustaining coral reef ecosystems.
   Recent studies have shown that elevated seawater temperatures can cause
   the collapse of their endosymbiosis, known as `bleaching', and result in
   mass mortality. However, the molecular interplay between temperature
   responses and symbiotic states still remains unclear. To identify
   candidate genes relevant to the symbiotic stability, we performed
   transcriptomic analyses under multiple conditions using the symbiotic
   and apo-symbiotic (symbiont free) Exaiptasia diaphana, an emerging model
   sea anemone. Gene expression patterns showed that large parts of
   differentially expressed genes in response to heat stress were specific
   to the symbiotic state, suggesting that the host sea anemone could react
   to environmental changes in a symbiotic state-dependent manner.
   Comparative analysis of expression profiles under multiple conditions
   highlighted candidate genes potentially important in the symbiotic state
   transition under heat-induced bleaching. Many of these genes were
   functionally associated with carbohydrate and protein metabolisms in
   lysosomes. Symbiont algal genes differentially expressed in hospite
   encode proteins related to heat shock response, calcium signaling,
   organellar protein transport, and sugar metabolism. Our data suggest
   that heat stress alters gene expression in both the hosts and symbionts.
   In particular, heat stress may affect the lysosome-mediated degradation
   and transportation of substrates such as carbohydrates through the
   symbiosome (phagosome-derived organelle harboring symbiont) membrane,
   which potentially might attenuate the stability of symbiosis and lead to
   bleaching-associated symbiotic state transition.},

Title = {Bleaching reduces reproduction in the giant clam Tridacna gigas},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {706},
Pages = {47-56},
Month = {FEB 23},
Abstract = {Bleaching or the expulsion of the photosynthetic symbiont
   Symbiodiniaceae ('zooxanthellae') caused by the increase in seawater
   temperatures causes massive mortalities in giant clams. After a
   bleaching disturbance, population recovery is heavily dependent on
   reproduction and recruitment success. However, how bleaching directly
   affects the reproductive performance of giant clams is, to date,
   unknown. Here, we examined the direct impacts of bleaching on the
   reproduction of the giant clam Tridacna gigas between 2020 and 2021 in
   the Philippines. A continuous 6 mo monitoring of egg concentration, egg
   stage, egg size, recovery, and survival in prolonged bleached (moderate
   or severe) and non-bleached hatchery-bred T. gigas maintained in the
   wild was conducted. The probability of producing eggs and the proportion
   of intact eggs (developing and mature) were highest in healthy giant
   clams, followed by moderately bleached giant clams, and lowest in
   severely bleached giant clams in which >50\% individuals had empty
   gonads. The oocyte mean diameter was similar among giant clams,
   regardless of degree of bleaching. Only 5 severely bleached giant clams
   showed partial color recovery, whereas 2 healthy and 12 severely
   bleached giant clams died. This study shows that apart from the lethal
   effects of severe bleaching, the reproductive processes of surviving
   bleached T. gigas such as gametogenesis and egg production can be also
   negatively affected. Results suggest that the increasing frequency and
   intensity of bleaching due to thermal stress can lower the reproductive
   potential of giant clams and likely other zooxanthellate organisms,
   resulting in reduced recruitment and population decline.},

Abstract = {The threats of wide-scale coral bleaching and reef demise associated
   with anthropogenic climate change are widely known. Moreover, rates of
   genetic adaptation and/or changes in the coral-zooxanthella partnerships
   are considered unlikely to be sufficiently fast for corals to acquire
   increased physiological resistance to increasing sea temperatures and
   declining pH. However, it has been suggested that coral reef resilience
   to climate change may be improved by good local management of coral
   reefs, including management of water quality. Here, using major data
   sets from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, we investigate
   geographic patterns of coral bleaching in 1998 and 2002 and outline a
   synergism between heat stress and nutrient flux as a major causative
   mechanism for those patterns. The study provides the first concrete
   evidence for the oft-expressed belief that improved coral reef
   management will increase the regional-scale survival prospects of coral
   reefs to global climate change.},

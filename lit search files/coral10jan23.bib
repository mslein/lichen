Abstract = {The effects of ocean acidification (OA) on coral reefs have been studied
   thoroughly with a focus on the response of calcification of corals and
   calcified algae. However, there are still large gaps in our knowledge of
   the effects of OA on photosynthesis and respiration of these organisms.
   Comparisons among species and determination of the functional
   relationships between pCO(2) and either photosynthesis or respiration
   are difficult using previously published data, because experimental
   conditions typically vary widely between studies. Here, we tested the
   response of net photosynthesis, gross photosynthesis, dark respiration,
   and light-enhanced dark respiration (LEDR) of eight coral taxa and seven
   calcified alga taxa to six different pCO(2) levels (from 280 to 2000 mu
   atm). Organisms were maintained during 7-10 days incubations in
   identical conditions of light, temperature, and pCO(2) to facilitate
   comparisons among species. Net photosynthesis was not affected by pCO(2)
   in seven of eight corals or any of the algae; gross photosynthesis did
   not respond to pCO(2) in six coral taxa and six algal taxa; dark
   respiration also was unaffected by pCO(2) in six coral and six algae;
   and LEDR did not respond to pCO(2) in any of the tested species.
   Overall, our results show that pCO(2) levels up to 2000 mu atm likely
   will not fertilize photosynthesis or modify respiration rates of most of
   the main calcifiers on the back reef of Moorea, French Polynesia.},

Abstract = {This study describes the effects of temperature on the respiration of
   brooded larvae of scleractinian corals, and evaluates the implications
   of these effects relative to seawater temperature when peak larval
   release occurs. Respiration rates of larvae from Pocillopora damicornis,
   Seriatopora hystrix and Stylophora pistillata were quantified in
   darkness as oxygen uptake during 1-3. h exposures to five temperatures
   between 26.4 and 29.6 degrees C. To assess the biological significance
   of these experiments, the temperature of the seawater into which larvae
   of P. damicornis and S. hystrix were released was measured for 32-34.
   months over 5 years between 2003 and 2008. Mean respiration varied from
   0.029 to 0.116 nmol O-2 larva(-1) min(-1), and was related parabolically
   to temperature with a positive threshold at 28.0 degrees C. The
   temperature coefficients (Q(10)) for the ascending portion of these
   relationships (Q(10)=15-76) indicate that the temperature dependency is
   stronger than can be explained by kinetics alone, and probably reflects
   behavioral and developmental effects. Larval release occurred year-round
   in synchrony with the lunar periodicity when seawater temperature ranged
   from 21.8 to 30.7 degrees C, and more than half of the sampled larvae
   were released at 27.5-28.9 degrees C. The coincidence on the temperature
   scale of peak larval release with the thermal threshold for respiration
   suggests that high metabolic rates have selective value for pelagic
   coral larvae. The large and rapid effects of temperature on larval
   respiration have implications for studies of the effects of climate
   change on coral reproduction, particularly when seawater temperature
   exceeds similar to 28 degrees C, when our results predict that larval
   respiration will be greatly reduced.},

Title = {Compound effects of thermal stress and tissue abrasion on photosynthesis

   (Lamarck, 1816)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2019},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Reef-building corals are threatened by multiple stressors, including
   rising ocean temperatures due to anthropogenic climate change, and
   tissue abrasion inflicted by increasing frequencies of recreational
   diving on tropical reefs. Both can impair coral growth and survival, but
   interactive effects of temperature and abrasion remain unknown. We
   conducted laboratory experiments to investigate the metabolic physiology
   of endangered Caribbean staghorn corals Acropora cervicornis (Lamarck,
   1816) in response to both types of stressors: (1) temperature variation
   (22, 25, 28, and 30 degrees C) and (2) tissue abrasion (15\% of tissue
   removed vs. non-abraded controls). Using flow-through respirometry, we
   measured net photosynthesis and respiration in 26 coral fragments (6
   genotypes) exposed to 8 treatment combinations (4 temperature x 2
   abrasion treatments). In non-abraded corals, net photosynthesis peaked
   at 25 degrees C but respiration increased linearly with temperature.
   Higher temperatures caused a decline in the ratio of photosynthesis to
   respiration (P:R), wherein corals were unable to meet their metabolic
   energy needs (P:R < 1). In addition, there was a significant interaction
   effect between the two stressors, in which tissue abrasion impaired
   photosynthesis and augmented respiration, especially at higher
   temperatures. We conclude that under conditions of both diver damage and
   elevated temperature, A. cervicornis cannot meet its energetic demands.
   These results indicate impairment of coral resilience to
   temperature-induced bleaching in areas exposed to high levels of
   abrasion (i.e.: popular dive sites). This information provides a
   scientific basis to support local reef management during climate change,
   and also reveals the metabolic processes that precede and underlie coral
   bleaching on tropical reefs.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs provide a range of important services to humanity, which are
   underpinned by community-level ecological processes such as coral
   calcification. Estimating these processes relies on our knowledge of
   individual physiological rates and species-specific abundances in the
   field. For colonial animals such as reef-building corals, abundance is
   frequently expressed as the relative surface cover of coral colonies, a
   metric that does not account for demographic parameters such as coral
   size. This may be problematic because many physiological rates are
   directly related to organism size, and failure to account for linear
   scaling patterns may skew estimates of ecosystem functioning. In the
   present study, we characterize the scaling of three physiological rates
   - calcification, respiration, and photosynthesis - considering the
   colony size for six prominent, reef-building coral taxa in Mo'orea,
   French Polynesia. After a seven-day acclimation period in the
   laboratory, we quantified coral physiological rates for three hours
   during daylight (i.e., calcification and gross photosynthesis) and one
   hour during night light conditions (i.e., dark respiration). Our results
   indicate that area-specific calcification rates are higher for smaller
   colonies across all taxa. However, photosynthesis and respiration rates
   remain constant over the colony-size gradient. Furthermore, we revealed
   a correlation between the demographic dynamics of coral genera and the
   ratio between net primary production and calcification rates. Therefore,
   intraspecific scaling of reef-building coral physiology not only
   improves our understanding of community-level coral reef functioning but
   it may also explain species-specific responses to disturbances.},

Abstract = {The response of scleractinian recruits to rising temperature will play
   an important role in determining how coral populations will be affected
   by global climate change, yet understanding these responses is made
   difficult by the lack of empirical data. In this study, the effects of
   elevated temperature (29.3 degrees C vs 27.3 degrees C) oil small
   colonies (mean diameters of 3-9 mm) of the Caribbean corals Porites
   spp., Agaricia spp. (Lamarck, 1801), Siderastrea siderea (Ellis and
   Solander, 1786), and Stephanocoenia intersepta (Lamarck, 1816) were
   tested by measuring the oxygen diffusion boundary layer (DBL) over the
   coenosarc in darkness at a constant flow speed of 0.8 cm s(-1). The
   results were used to estimate the aerobic respiration by means of Fick's
   first law. Temperature had no effect on the DBL thickness, but there
   were interactive effects of temperature and taxon on the oxygen
   concentration adjacent to the tissue and the respiration rates. Between
   27.3 degrees C and 29.3 degrees C, the respiration of coenosarc tissue
   increased dramatically for S. intersepta (Q(10) = 105), but decreased
   for Porites spp. (Q(10) = 0.1), and remained unchanged for Agaricia spp.
   and S. siderea. These trends are inconsistent with a kinetic model of
   the effects of temperature on aerobic respiration, and it is
   hypothesized that they reflect the effects of behavior (e.g., tissue
   contraction or altered fluid transport among polyps) in mediating
   changes in the metabolic activity of the coenosarc.},

Abstract = {Extreme reef environments have become useful natural laboratories to
   investigate physiological specificities of species chronically exposed
   to future-like climatic conditions. The lagoon of Bourake in New
   Caledonia (21 degrees 56 ` 56.16 `' S; 125 degrees 59 ` 36.82 `' E) is
   one of the only reef environments studied where the three main climatic
   stressors predicted to most severely impact corals occur. In this
   lagoon, temperatures, seawater pH(T) and dissolved oxygen chronically
   fluctuate between extreme and close-to-normal values (17.5-33.85 degrees
   C, 7.23-7.92 pH(T) units and 1.87-7.24 mg O-2 L-1, respectively). In
   March 2020, the endosymbiont functions (chl a, cell density and
   photosynthesis) and respiration rates were investigated in seven coral
   species from this lagoon and compared with those of corals from an
   adjacent reference site using hour-long incubations mimicking
   present-day and future conditions. Corals originating from Bourake
   displayed significant differences in these variables compared to
   reference corals, but these differences were species-specific.
   Photosynthetic rates of Bourake corals were all significantly lower than
   those of reference corals but were partially compensated by higher
   chlorophyll contents. Respiration rates of the Bourake corals were
   either lower or comparable to those of reference corals. Conversely,
   photosynthesis and respiration rates of most studied species were
   similar regardless of the incubation conditions, which mimicked either
   present-day or future conditions. This study supports previous work
   indicating that no unique response can explain corals' tolerance to
   sub-optimal conditions and that a variety of mechanisms will be at play
   for corals in a changing world.},

Title = {Physiological response of the cold-water coral Desmophyllum dianthus to
   thermal stress and ocean acidification},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Month = {FEB 2},
Abstract = {Rising temperatures and ocean acidification driven by anthropogenic
   carbon emissions threaten both tropical and temperate corals. However,
   the synergistic effect of these stressors on coral physiology is still
   poorly understood, in particular for cold-water corals. This study
   assessed changes in key physiological parameters (calcification,
   respiration and ammonium excretion) of the widespread cold-water coral
   Desmophyllum dianthus maintained for similar to 8 months at two
   temperatures (ambient 12 degrees C and elevated 15 degrees C) arid two
   pCO(2) conditions (ambient 390 ppm and elevated 750 ppm). At ambient
   temperatures no change in instantaneous calcification, respiration or
   ammonium excretion rates was observed at either pCO2 levels. Conversely,
   elevated temperature (15 degrees C) significantly reduced calcification
   rates, and combined elevated temnetatute and PCO2 signincantlY reduced
   respiration rates. Changes in the ratio of respired oxygen to excreted
   nitrogen (O:N), which provides information on the main sources of energy
   being metabolized, indicated a shift from mixed use of protein and
   carbohydrate/lipid as metabolic substrates under control conditions, to
   less efficient protein-dominated catabolism under both stressors.
   Overall, this study shows that the physiology of D. dianthus is more
   sensitive to thermal than pCO(2) stress, and that the predicted
   combination of rising temperatures and ocean acidification in the coming
   decades may severely impact this cold-water coral species.},

Abstract = {Metabolic rates provide a valuable means to assess the condition of
   early life stages of scleractinians, but their small biomass creates a
   signal-to-noise problem in a confined respirometer. To avoid this
   problem, measurements of the oxygen diffusion boundary layer (DBL) and
   Fick's first law were used to calculate the respiration rate of
   coenosarc tissue on recruits (i.e., colonies 5 - 14 mm diameter) of
   Porites lutea ( Edwards and Haime, 1860) exposed to two temperatures at
   a flow speed of 0.6 cm s(-1). All experiments were completed in Moorea,
   French Polynesia, between November and December 2003. At 26.8 degreesC,
   the DBL was 565 +/- 55 mum thick, the oxygen saturation adjacent to the
   tissue was 80 +/- 3\%, and the mean respiration of the coenosarc was 1.2
   +/- 0.1 mul O-2 cm(-2) h(-1) ( all values mean +/- SE, n= 10). Exposure
   to 29.7 degreesC for 24 - 48 h did not a. ect the DBL thickness but
   significantly reduced the oxygen saturation adjacent to the tissue ( to
   74\%) and increased the mean respiration rate by 35\%. As the small
   corals differed slightly in size, in a uniform flow speed they
   experienced dissimilar flow environments as characterized by the
   Reynolds number ( Re), thereby creating the opportunity to test the flow
   dependency of respiration. At 26.8 degreesC, respiration and Re were
   unrelated, but at 29.7 degreesC, the relationship was positive and
   statistically significant. Thus, respiration of small corals may not be
   mass transfer limited at low temperature, but relatively small increases
   in temperature may result in an increased metabolic rate leading to mass
   transfer limitation and flow-dependent rates of respiration.},

Abstract = {Understanding how rising seawater pCO(2) and temperatures impact coral
   aragonite accretion is essential for predicting the future of reef
   ecosystems. Here, we report 2 long-term (10-11 month) studies assessing
   the effects of temperature (25 and 28 degrees C) and both high and low
   seawater pCO(2) (180-750 mu atm) on the calcification, photosynthesis
   and respiration of individual massive Porites spp. genotypes.
   Calcification rates were highly variable between genotypes, but high
   seawater pCO(2) reduced calcification significantly in 4 of 7 genotypes
   cultured at 25 degrees C but in only 1 of 4 genotypes cultured at 28
   degrees C. Increasing seawater temperature enhanced calcification in
   almost all corals, but the magnitude of this effect was seawater pCO(2)
   dependent. The 3 degrees C temperature increase enhanced calcification
   rate on average by 3\% at 180 mu atm, by 35\% at 260 mu atm and by >
   300\% at 750 mu atm. The rate increase at high seawater pCO(2) exceeds
   that observed in inorganic aragonites. Responses of gross/net
   photosynthesis and respiration to temperature and seawater pCO(2) varied
   between genotypes, but rates of all these processes were reduced at the
   higher seawater temperature. Increases in seawater temperature, below
   the thermal stress threshold, may mitigate against ocean acidification
   in this coral genus, but this moderation is not mediated by an increase
   in net photosynthesis. The response of coral calcification to
   temperature cannot be explained by symbiont productivity or by
   thermodynamic and kinetic influences on aragonite formation.},

   psu. The P-g:R ratio was always higher at the control salinity. Most of
   the colonies maintained at 40 psu died, and this was explained by a very

Abstract = {Cold-water corals (CWCs) are key ecosystem engineers in deep-sea benthic
   communities around the world. Their distribution patterns are related to
   several abiotic and biotic factors, of which seawater temperature is
   arguably one of the most important due to its role in coral
   physiological processes. The CWC Dendrophyllia cornigera has the
   particular ability to thrive in several locations in which temperatures
   range from 11 to 17 A degrees C, but to be apparently absent from most
   CWC reefs at temperatures constantly below 11 A degrees C. This study
   thus aimed to assess the thermal tolerance of this CWC species,
   collected in the Mediterranean Sea at 12 A degrees C, and grown at the
   three relevant temperatures of 8, 12, and 16 A degrees C. This species
   displayed thermal tolerance to the large range of seawater temperatures
   investigated, but growth, calcification, respiration, and total organic
   carbon (TOC) fluxes severely decreased at 8 A degrees C compared to the
   in situ temperature of 12 A degrees C. Conversely, no significant
   differences in calcification, respiration, and TOC fluxes were observed
   between corals maintained at 12 and 16 A degrees C, suggesting that the
   fitness of this CWC is higher in temperate rather than cold
   environments. The capacity to maintain physiological functions between
   12 and 16 A degrees C allows D. cornigera to be the most abundant CWC
   species in deep-sea ecosystems where temperatures are too warm for other
   CWC species (e.g., Canary Islands). This study also shows that not all
   CWC species occurring in the Mediterranean Sea (at deep-water
   temperatures of 12-14 A degrees C) are currently living at their upper
   thermal tolerance limit.},

Abstract = {Plesiastrea versipora is a hermatypic coral with a distribution that
   extends to the southern limit for hermatypic corals. The normal annual
   temperature range for this coral in Port Phillip Bay (Victoria)
   (approximately 10-21 degreesC) is well below the physiological optimum
   for the majority of hermatypic corals (25-29 degreesC). The rate of
   photosynthesis and respiration in Plesiastrea generally increased with
   temperature before levelling out at the higher temperatures, with Q(10)
   data suggesting that both photosynthesis and respiration in Plesiastrea
   acclimate to changing temperatures. Respiration showed a similar trend
   to photosynthesis, with respect to temperature, but with a slightly
   lower rate of increase. Photosynthetic rate in Plesiastrea is comparable
   with that of reef corals despite lower temperatures and irradiance. When
   expressed as a function of chlorophyll a content photosynthesis
   approached perfect temperature compensation with prolonged exposure to
   various temperatures. Temperature-dependent changes with chlorophyll
   content may be responsible for temperature related changes in
   photosynthetic rate. This may be a mechanism for stabilising the
   symbiotic relationship over a wide temperature range. Autotrophic
   ability, estimated from photosynthesis/respiration (P/R) ratios, was
   greatest at higher temperatures and was only slightly less than that of
   reef corals. At low temperatures Plesiastrea may be dependent on
   heterotrophic feeding. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {In coral reefs, heterotrophic bacteria play an important role in driving
   carbon cycle and sustaining coral health. Bacterial production (BP),
   bacterial respiration (BR) and bacterial community composition (BCC)
   were determined in the Luhuitou fringing reef and the surrounding ocean
   in the northern South China Sea on a seasonal basis, in order to examine
   bacterial metabolic activity and effect of temperature on bacterial
   community in the fringing coral reef. Our results showed that higher BP
   (3.52-12.45 mu g C L-1 d(-1)) and bacterial growth efficiency
   (0.16-0.28) and lower cellular BR (8.34-31.73 fg C cell(-1) d(-1)) in
   the Luhuitou fringing reef than the surrounding ocean was more likely
   attributed to substrate availability. Enhanced dissolved organic
   nitrogen availability preferentially triggered the growth of bacteria
   with high nucleic acid content (HNA bacteria), which was most possibly
   responsible for high BP in the coral reef. Heterotrophic bacteria were
   more sensitive to temperature in the highly productive Luhuitou fringing
   reef than the surrounding ocean. Temperature shaped BCC by mediating
   enzymatic activity in the coral reef, likely triggering opportunistic
   infections. Warming might not only promote the growth of HNA bacteria
   and shift BCC in the coral reef, which was partly responsible for coral
   disease, but also reduce oxygen replenishment from the surface due to
   stratification and elevate the oxygen consumption owing to high BR,
   consequently threatening the survival of corals. Our findings helped to
   better understand how heterotrophic bacteria mediated the survival of
   corals in response to fluctuations of temperature.},

   of the coral with symbiotic zooxanthellae were measured in summer and

   summer and winter, whereas it was higher in summer than in winter under
   each irradiance. At 25/50/100 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1), it was nearly
   the seawater temperature in each season. Dark respiration rate was
   higher in winter than in summer, especially in the range from
   20-30degreesC. In both seasons the optimum temperature for gross

   temperature variations (20-28 degrees C)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {225},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Temperature is a key driver of metabolic rates. So far, we know little
   about potential physiological adjustments of subtropical corals to
   seasonal temperature changes (>8 degrees C) that substantially exceed
   temperature fluctuation experienced by their counterparts in the
   tropics. This study investigated the effect of temperature reductions on
   Montastraea cavemosa and Ponies astreoides in Bermuda (32 degrees N; sea
   surface temperature similar to 19-29 degrees C) over 5 weeks, applying
   the following treatments: (i) constant control temperature at 28 degrees
   C, and (ii) temperature reduction (0.5 degrees C day(-1)) followed by
   constant temperature (20 days; acclimatization period) at 24 degrees C
   and (iii) at 20 degrees C. Both species decreased photosynthesis and
   respiration during temperature reduction as expected, which continued to
   decrease during the acclimatization period, indicating adjustment to a
   low energy turnover rather than thermal compensation. Trajectories of
   physiological adjustments and level of thermal compensation, however,
   differed between species. Montastraea cavemosa zooxanthellae metrics
   showed a strong initial response to temperature reduction, followed by a
   return to close to control values during the acclimatization period,
   reflecting a high physiological flexibility and low thermal
   compensation. Ponies astreoides zooxanthellae, in contrast, showed no
   initial response, but an increase in pigment concentration per
   zooxanthellae and similar photosynthesis rates at 24 degrees C and 20
   degrees C at the end of the experiment, indicating low acute thermal
   sensitivity and the ability for thermal compensation at the lowest
   temperature. Respiration decreased more strongly than photosynthesis,
   leading to significant build-up of biomass in both species (energy
   reserves). Results are important in the light of potential poleward
   migration of corals and of potential latitudinal and species-specific
   differences in coral thermal tolerance.},

Abstract = {Although prior exposure to high light is reported to make the coral
   Goniastrea aspera more tolerant to bleaching, effects of prior exposure
   to high temperature have not been studied. We examined the influence of
   prior exposure to high temperature on the photoinhibition-sensitivity of
   photosynthetic activity in the zooxanthellae of two
   bleaching-susceptible corals, Stylophora pistillata and Montipora
   digitata, and two bleaching-tolerant corals, Pachyseris rugosa and
   Pavona divaricata from Okinawa, Japan. Coral fragments were acclimated
   either at 24 or 31degreesC for 5 days, and then exposed to high light
   (1,200 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1)) for 2 h at 24 or 31degreesC.
   Bleaching-susceptible species acclimated at 31degreesC showed
   significant increase in photosynthetic activity (P-max) and total
   chlorophyll content, while bleaching-tolerant species showed the
   opposite pattern. The rate of dark respiration (R) was significantly
   higher in fragments acclimated at 31degreesC than in those acclimated at
   24degreesC in all investigated coral species. F-v/F-m decreased to a
   similar extent after high light treatment at 31degreesC in corals
   acclimated at 24 and 31degreesC in both tolerant and susceptible
   species. Pmax and chlorophyll content of bleaching-susceptible corals
   showed a more pronounced decline after high light exposure at 31degreesC
   than those of bleaching-tolerant species. The extent of reduction in
   P-max and chlorophyll content was significantly higher in fragments of
   S. pistillata and M. digitata acclimated at 31degreesC than in those
   acclimated at 24degreesC. Significant decrease in R was evident only in
   susceptible species acclimated at 31degreesC and exposed to high light
   at 31degreesC. These results suggest that mechanisms underlying the
   thermal acclimation of photosynthesis vary with coral species. A high
   photosynthetic acclimation potential to temperature might be associated
   with a response of P-max but not F-v/F-m. Susceptibility of S.
   pistillata and M. digitata to synergistic effects of high light and
   elevated temperature depends on a decreased capacity of their
   zooxanthellae to cope with photodamage, although the role of the host
   can not be excluded.},

Journal = {DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {193},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Deep-sea reef ecosystems are hotspots of biodiversity but are
   particularly threatened by seawater warming, because the species that
   live there have evolved within a narrow thermal range. The degree to
   which cold-water corals (CWCs), the reef builders, can acclimate to
   changes in their thermal environment requires more investigation. Our
   study is one of the very first to assess the thermal performance of
   Dendrophylliidae CWCs on a 2-year basis. Colonies of Dendrophyllia
   cornigera and D. ramea, collected in the Mediterranean Sea, were exposed
   during 2 years to their natural mean temperatures (referred as control
   temperature, CT) or to temperatures being 4 degrees C (T+4) and 8
   degrees C (T+8) higher. A 4 degrees C decrease in temperature (T-4) was
   also tested for D. ramea. Several physiological parameters, such as
   rates of growth, calcification, and respiration, as well as total
   organic carbon release were measured after 2 and 20 months of treatment.
   The results obtained show that Dendrophylliidae corals are able to
   survive a +4 degrees C over a two-year period, and even a +8 degrees C
   for D. ramea. The elevation in temperature induced a transient increase
   in all physiological parameters. However, after 20 months, parameters
   were significantly decreased compared to the first measurement. At the
   end of the experiment, growth rates were even significantly lower at T+4
   and T+8 compared to the control temperature, suggesting that the coral
   lifespan is significantly reduced over the long term. Finally, we
   observed a positive relationship between respiration and calcification
   rates in these corals, suggesting that the calcification process is
   dependent on the inorganic carbon provided by respiration. Overall, this
   study shows that physiological processes in CWC species are slow and
   that long-term incubations are necessary to predict the impact of
   climate change on their survival capacities.},

Title = {Species-specific impact of microplastics on coral physiology},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {269},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {There is evidence that microplastic (MP) pollution can negatively
   influence coral health; however, mechanisms are unknown and most studies
   have used MP exposure concentrations that are considerably higher than
   current environmental conditions. Furthermore, whether MP exposure
   influences coral susceptibility to other stressors such as ocean warming
   is unknown. Our objective was to determine the physiology response of
   corals exposed to MP concentrations that have been observed in-situ at
   ambient and elevated temperature that replicates ocean warming. Here,
   two sets of short-term experiments were conducted at ambient and
   elevated temperature, exposing the corals Acropora sp. and Seriatopora
   hystrix to microspheres and microfibres. Throughout the experiments,
   gross photosynthesis and net respiration was quantified using a
   4-chamber coral respirometer, and photosynthetic yields of photosystem
   II were measured using Pulse-Amplitude Modulated (PAM) fluorometry.
   Results indicate the effect of MP exposure is dependent on MP type,
   coral species, and temperature. MP fibres (but not spheres) reduced
   photosynthetic capability of Acropora sp., with a 41\% decrease in
   photochemical efficiency at ambient temperature over 12 days. No
   additional stress response was observed at elevated temperature;
   photosynthetic performance significantly increased in Seriatopora
   hystrix exposed to MP spheres. These findings show that a disruption to
   coral photosynthetic ability can occur at MP concentrations that have
   been observed in the marine environment and that MP pollution impact on
   corals remains an important aspect for further research. (C) 2020

Abstract = {We show here that CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) and temperature
   significantly interact on coral physiology. The effects of increased
   pCO(2) and temperature on photosynthesis, respiration and calcification
   rates were investigated in the scleractinian coral Stylophora
   pistillata. Cuttings were exposed to temperatures of 25degreesC or
   28degreesC and to pCO(2) values of ca. 460 or 760 muatm for 5 weeks. The
   contents of chlorophyll c(2) and protein remained constant throughout
   the experiment, while the chlorophyll a content was significantly
   affected by temperature, and was higher under the
   `high-temperature-high-pCO(2)' condition. The cell-specific density was
   higher at `high pCO(2)' than at `normal pCO(2)' (1.7 vs. 1.4). The net
   photosynthesis normalized per unit protein was affected by both
   temperature and pCO(2), whereas respiration was not affected by the
   treatments. Calcification decreased by 50\% when temperature and pCO(2)
   were both elevated. Calcification under normal temperature did not
   change in response to an increased pCO(2). This is not in agreement with
   numerous published papers that describe a negative relationship between
   marine calcification and CO2. The confounding effect of temperature has
   the potential to explain a large portion of the variability of the
   relationship between calcification and pCO(2) reported in the
   literature, and warrants a re-evaluation of the projected decrease of
   marine calcification by the year 2100.},

Title = {Photosynthesis and respiration of the soft coral Xenia umbellata respond
   to warming but not to organic carbon eutrophication},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUL 27},
Abstract = {Eutrophication with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as a far
   under-investigated stressor, and ocean warming, can strongly affect
   coral reefs and hard corals as major reefs ecosystem engineers. However,
   no previous studies have investigated the metabolic responses of soft
   corals to DOC eutrophication, or its interaction with ocean warming.
   Thus, we investigated respiration and photosynthesis response of Xenia
   umbellata, a common mixotrophic soft coral from the Indo-pacific, to (1)
   three levels of DOC eutrophication simulated by glucose addition over
   the first 21 days of experiment and (2) ocean warming scenarios where
   the temperature was gradually increased from 26 degrees C (control
   condition) to 32 degrees C over another 24 days in an aquarium
   experiment. We found no significant difference in response to DOC
   treatments and all corals survived regardless of the DOC concentrations,
   whilst subsequent exposure to simulated ocean warming significantly
   decreased gross photosynthesis by approximately 50\% at 30 degrees C,
   and 65\% at 32 degrees C, net photosynthesis by 75\% at 30 degrees C and
   79\% at 32 degrees C, and respiration by a maximum of 75\% at 30 degrees
   C; with a slight increase at 32 degrees C of 25\%. The ratio between
   gross photosynthesis and respiration decreased by the end of the warming
   period but remained similar between controls and colonies previously
   exposed to DOC. Our findings suggest that soft corals may be more
   resistant than hard corals to DOC eutrophication and in consequence, may
   potentially experiment in less magnitude the negative effects of
   increased temperature or subsequently both stressors. The results of
   this study may contribute to explain the successful role of soft corals
   in phase shifts as reported from many coral reefs. Where predicted
   declines in reef ecosystems health due to increased eutrophication
   levels can be exacerbated by future warming.},

Abstract = {This study tested the hypothesis that the response of corals to
   temperature and pCO 2 is consistent between taxa. Juvenile massive
   Porites spp. and branches of P. rus from the back reef of Moorea were
   incubated for 1 similar to month under combinations of temperature (29.3
   similar to degrees C and 25.6 similar to degrees C) and pCO 2 (41.6
   similar to Pa and 81.5 similar to Pa) at an irradiance of 599 similar to
   mu mol quanta m-2 s-1. Using microcosms and CO2 gas mixing technology,
   treatments were created in a partly nested design (tanks) with two
   between-plot factors (temperature and pCO 2), and one within-plot factor
   (taxon); calcification was used as a dependent variable. pCO 2 and
   temperature independently affected calcification, but the response
   differed between taxa. Massive Porites spp. was largely unaffected by
   the treatments, but P. rus grew 50\% faster at 29.3 similar to degrees C
   compared with 25.6 similar to degrees C, and 28\% slower at 81.5 similar
   to Pa vs. 41.6 similar to Pa CO2. A compilation of studies placed the
   present results in a broader context and tested the hypothesis that
   calcification for individual coral genera is independent of pH, {[}HCO3
   -], and {[}CO3 2-]. Unlike recent reviews, this analysis was restricted
   to studies reporting calcification in units that could be converted to
   nmol CaCO3 similar to cm-2 similar to h-1. The compilation revealed a
   high degree of variation in calcification as a function of pH, {[}HCO3
   -], and {[}CO3 2-], and supported three conclusions: (1) studies of the
   effects of ocean acidification on corals need to pay closer attention to
   reducing variance in experimental outcomes to achieve stronger synthetic
   capacity, (2) coral genera respond in dissimilar ways to pH, {[}HCO3 -],
   and {[}CO3 2-], and (3) calcification of massive Porites spp. is
   relatively resistant to short exposures of increased pCO 2, similar to
   that expected within 100 y.},

   only at low light levels. At higher irradiance, relative electron
   transport rate (rETR) approached saturation more slowly than rates of
   oxygen production. At constant temperature, a change in light did not
   induce any change in zooxanthellae (zoox) and chlorophyll (Chl a+c(2))
   concentrations (mean 3.7x10(6) zoox cm(-2) and 14.1 mu g cm(-2),
   respectively); however, chlorophyll concentrations significantly
   increased under low light and temperature, probably in order to maintain
   a sufficient level of autotrophy. Maximal gross photosynthesis (Pg(max))
   as well as the saturation irradiance (E(k)) and the respiration rate (R)
   were, however, significantly higher at 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) compared
   to the lower light treatments, independently of temperature conditions.
   Acclimation to high light appeared to be partly driven by a change in
   the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) capacity of the algal cells, and
   to a maximal rate of photon utilization. Conversely, under low light
   conditions, coral polyps presented a lower E(k), but also lower
   respiration rates, which correspond to a decrease in the energy
   expenditure. This ability to acclimate to different light conditions,
   might allow C. caespitosa to rapidly regulate its autotrophic rate in
   the different light conditions encountered in its natural habitats.},

Title = {Broad Thermal Tolerance in the Cold-Water Coral Lophelia pertusa From
   Arctic and Boreal Reefs},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JAN 21},
Abstract = {Along the Norwegian coasts and margins, extensive reefs of the stony
   coral Lophelia pertusa act as hotspots for local biodiversity. Climate
   models project that the temperature of Atlantic deep waters could rise
   by 1-3 degrees C by 2100. In this context, understanding the effects of
   temperature on the physiology of cold-water species will help in
   evaluating their resilience to future oceanic changes. We investigated
   the response of L. pertusa to stepwise short-term increases in
   temperature. We sampled corals from four reefs, two located north of the
   Arctic circle and two at the mid-Norwegian shelf (boreal). In on-board
   experiments (one per reef), the sampled fragments were exposed to
   increasing temperatures from 5 to 15 degrees C over 58 h. Respiration
   increased linearly by threefold for a 10 degrees C increase. The
   short-term temperature increase did not induce mortality, cellular
   (neutral red assay for lysosome membrane stability; but one exception)
   or oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation assay) - to a few exceptions.
   However, the variability of the respiration responses depended on the
   experiment (i.e., reef location), possibly linked to the genetic
   structure of the individuals that we sampled (e.g., clones or siblings).
   The corals from the Arctic and boreal regions appear to have a high
   tolerance to the rapid temperature fluctuations they experience in the
   field. Over extended periods of time however, an increased metabolism
   could deplete the energy stored by the corals, if not met by an
   increased food availability and/or uptake. Empirical data on organisms'
   thermal performance curves, such as the one presented in this study for
   L. pertusa, will be useful to implement predictive models on the
   responses of species and populations to climate change.},

Abstract = {Water quality is declining in many coastal areas, which has caused coral
   degradation worldwide. In addition, reduced water quality may aggravate
   the impacts of seawater temperature. In this study the effects of
   increased temperature (31 degrees C), nitrate enrichment (+5 mu M
   NO(3)(-)), low salinity (20) and combinations of these stressors were
   investigated compared to ambient water (25 degrees C, 30, 0.3 mu M
   NO(3)(-)) on the metabolism and survival of the coral Turbinaria
   mesenterina from the Tonkin Gulf, Vietnam. The results showed that all
   specimens exposed to a combination of all three stressors (i.e. high
   temperature + high nitrate + low salinity) died after 24 h exposure,
   while those that had been exposed to high nitrate + low salinity at
   ambient temperature did not show any effects on the metabolism or
   survival. Furthermore, corals exposed to low salinity + high temperature
   displayed a decrease in gross primary production/respiration (GP/R)
   ratio and the mortality rate was 50\%. In addition, all corals exposed
   to increased temperature, alone or in combination with another stressor,
   displayed a GP/R(24h) ratio below 1.0, suggesting that they depend on
   stored energy to cover their metabolic requirements. The results showed
   that corals may tolerate short-term exposure to stressors such as low
   salinity + high nitrate concentration in ambient temperature, while
   additional increased temperature lead to rapid mortality, hence
   suggesting a synergistic effect.
   Thus, the effect of climate change might be more severe in nearshore
   coastal areas where corals already are exposed to several disturbances.

Abstract = {The scleractinian cold-water corals (CWC) Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora
   oculata represent two major deep-sea reef-forming species that act as
   key ecosystem engineers over a wide temperature range, extending from
   the northern Atlantic (ca. 5-9 degrees C) to the Mediterranean Sea (ca.
   11-13 degrees C). Recent research suggests that environmental
   parameters, such as food supply, settling substrate availability or
   aragonite saturation state may represent important precursors
   controlling habitat suitability for CWC. However, the effect of one
   principal environmental factor, temperature, on CWC key physiological
   processes is still unknown. In order to evaluate this effect on
   calcification, respiration, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) net flux,
   colonies of Mediterranean L pertusa and M. oculata were acclimated in
   aquaria to three temperatures (12, 9 and 6 degrees C), by consecutive
   decrements of 1 month duration. L pertusa and M. oculata maintained at
   Mediterranean control conditions (i.e. 12 degrees C) displayed constant
   rates, on average respiring 4.8 and 4.0 mu mol O-2 cm(-2) coral surface
   area d(-1), calcifying 22.3 and 12.3 gmol CaCO3 g(-1) skeletal dry
   weight d(-1) and net releasing 2.6 and 3.1 mu mol DOC cm(-2) coral
   surface area d(-1), respectively. Respiration of L pertusa was not
   affected by lowered temperatures, while M. oculata respiration declined
   significantly (by 48\%) when temperature decreased to 9 degrees C and 6
   degrees C relative to controls. L pertusa calcification at 9 degrees C
   was similar to controls, but decreased significantly (by 58\%) at 6
   degrees C. For M. oculata, calcification declined by 41\% at 9 degrees C
   and by 69\% at 6 degrees C. DOC net flux was similar throughout the
   experiment for both CWC. These findings reveal species-specific
   physiological responses by CWC within their natural temperature range. L
   pertusa shows thermal acclimation in respiration and calcification,
   while these mechanisms appear largely absent in M. oculata.
   Conclusively, species-specific thermal acclimation may significantly
   affect the occurrence and local abundance of cosmopolitan CWC species,
   consequently influencing their important role in habitat engineering and
   ecosystem functioning in various thermal environments. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {The effects of elevated temperature and high pCO(2) on the metabolism of
   Galaxea fascicularis were studied with oxygen and pH microsensors.
   Photosynthesis and respiration rates were evaluated from the oxygen
   fluxes from and to the coral polyps. High-temperature alone lowered both
   photosynthetic and respiration rates. High pCO(2) alone did not
   significantly affect either photosynthesis or respiration rates. Under a
   combination of high-temperature and high-CO2, the photosynthetic rate
   increased to values close to those of the controls. The same pH in the
   diffusion boundary layer was observed under light in both (400 and 750
   ppm) CO2 treatments, but decreased significantly in the dark as a result
   of increased CO2. The ATP contents decreased with increasing
   temperature. The effects of temperature on the metabolism of corals were
   stronger than the effects of increased CO2. The effects of acidification
   were minimal without combined temperature stress. However, acidification
   combined with higher temperature may affect coral metabolism due to the
   amplification of diel variations in the microenvironment surrounding the
   coral and the decrease in ATP contents. (C) 2013 Academie des sciences.

Abstract = {Coral reefs across the Caribbean are undergoing unprecedented rates of
   decline in coral cover during the last three decades, and coral
   recruitment is one potential process that could aid the recovery of
   coral populations. To better understand the effects of climate change on
   coral larval ecology, the larvae of Porites astreoides were studied to
   determine the immediate and post-settlement effects of elevated
   temperature and associated oxidative stress. Larvae of Porites
   astreoides were exposed to 27 A degrees C (ambient) and +3.0 A degrees C
   (elevated temperature) seawater for a short duration of 24 h; then, a
   suite of physiological parameters were measured to determine the extent
   of sublethal stress. Following the +3.0 A degrees C treatment, larvae
   did not show a significant difference in maximum quantum yield of PSII
   (F (v)/F (m)) or respiratory demand when compared to controls maintained
   at 27 A degrees C. The addition of micromolar concentrations of hydrogen
   peroxide did not impact respiration or photochemical efficiency.
   Catalase activity in the larvae increased (> 60 \%) following exposure
   to elevated temperature when compared to the controls. Short-term larval
   survival and settlement and metamorphosis were not affected by increased
   temperature or the H2O2 treatment. However, the settled spat that were
   exposed to elevated temperature underwent a 99 \% reduction in survival
   compared to 90 \% reduction for the control spat when examined 24 days
   following the deployment of 4-day-old settled spat on settlement tiles
   in the field. These results show that short-term exposure to some
   stressors might have small impacts on coral physiology, and no effects
   on larval survival, settlement and metamorphosis. However, due to
   post-settlement mortality, these stressors can cause a significant
   reduction in coral recruitment.},

Title = {Photosynthetic response of Persian Gulf acroporid corals to summer

Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {With on-going climate change, coral susceptibility to thermal stress
   constitutes a central concern in reefconservation. In the Persian Gulf,
   coral reefs are confronted with a high seasonal variability in water
   temperature, and both hot and cold extremes have been associated with
   episodes of coral bleaching and mortality. Using physiological
   performance as a measure of coral health, we investigated the thermal
   susceptibility of the common acroporid, Acropora downingi, near Hengam
   Island where the temperature oscillates seasonally in the range
   20.2-34.2 degrees C. In a series of two short-term experiments comparing
   coral response in summer versus winter conditions, we exposed corals
   during each season (1) to the corresponding seasonal average and extreme
   temperature levels in a static thermal environment, and (2) to a
   progressive temperature deviation from the annual mean toward the
   corresponding extreme seasonal value and beyond in a dynamic thermal
   environment. We monitored four indictors of coral physiological
   performance: net photosynthesis (Pn), dark respiration (R), autotrophic
   capability (Pn/R), and survival. Corals exposed to warming during summer
   showed a decrease in net photosynthesis and ultimately died, while
   corals exposed to cooling during winter were not affected in their
   photosynthetic performance and survival. Coral autotrophic capability
   Pn/R was lower at the warmer thermal level within eachseason, and during
   summer compared to winter. Corals exposed to the maximum temperature of
   summer displayed Pn/R < 1, inferring that photosynthetic performance
   could not support basal metabolic needs under this environment. Our
   results suggest that the autotrophic performance of the Persian Gulf A.
   downingi is sensitive to the extreme temperatures endured in summer, and
   therefore its populations may be impacted by future increases in water
   temperature.},

Number = {11},

Abstract = {Coral reefs of the Florida Keys typically experience seasonal
   temperatures of 20-31 degrees C. Deviation outside this range causes
   physiological impairment of reef-building corals, potentially leading to
   coral colony death. In January and February 2010, two closely spaced
   cold fronts, possibly driven by an unusually extreme Arctic Oscillation,
   caused sudden and severe seawater temperature declines in the Florida
   Keys. Inshore coral reefs {[}e. g., Admiral Reef (ADM)] experienced
   lower sustained temperatures (i.e., < 12 degrees C) than those further
   offshore {[}e. g., Little Grecian Reef (LG), minimum temperature = 17.2
   degrees C]. During February and March 2010, we surveyed ADM and observed
   a mass die-off of reef-building corals, whereas 12 km away LG did not
   exhibit coral mortality. We subsequently measured the physiological
   effects of low-temperature stress on three common reef-building corals
   (i.e., Montastraea faveolata, Porites astreoides, and Siderastrea
   siderea) over a range of temperatures that replicated the inshore
   cold-water anomaly (i.e., from 20 to 16 to 12 degrees C and back to 20
   degrees C). Throughout the temperature modulations, coral respiration as
   well as endosymbiont gross photosynthesis and maximum quantum efficiency
   of photosystem II were measured. In addition, Symbiodinium genotypic
   identity, cell densities, and chlorophyll a content were determined at
   the beginning and conclusion of the experiment. All corals were
   significantly affected at 12 degrees C, but species-specific
   physiological responses were found indicating different coral and/or
   Symbiodinium cold tolerances. Montastraea faveolata and P. astreoides
   appeared to be most negatively impacted because, upon return to 20
   degrees C, significant reductions in gross photosynthesis and dark
   respiration persisted. Siderastrea siderea, however, readily recovered
   to pre-treatment rates of dark respiration and gross photosynthesis.
   Visual surveys of inshore reefs corroborated these results, with S.
   siderea being minimally affected by the cold-water anomaly, whereas M.
   faveolata and P. astreoides exhibited nearly 100\% mortality. This study
   highlights the importance of understanding the physiological attributes
   of genotypically distinct coral-Symbiodinium symbioses that contribute
   to tolerance, recovery, and consequences to an environmental
   perturbation. These data also document effects of a rarely studied
   environmental stressor, possibly initiated by remote global climate
   events, on coral-Symbiodinium symbioses and coral reef communities.},

Abstract = {Elevated temperatures and nutrients are degrading coral reef ecosystems,
   but the understanding of how early life stages of reef corals respond to
   these stressors remains limited. Here, we test the impact of temperature
   (mean similar to 27 degrees C vs. similar to 29 degrees C) and nitrate
   and phosphate enrichment (ambient, + 5 mu M nitrate, + 1 mu M phosphate
   and combined + 5 mu M nitrate with 1 mu M phosphate) on coral larvae
   using three Hawaiian coral species with different modes of symbiont
   transmission and reproduction: Lobactis scutaria (horizontal, gonochoric
   broadcast spawner), Pocillopora acuta (vertical, hermaphroditic brooder)
   and Montipora capitata (vertical, hermaphroditic broadcast spawner).
   Temperature and nutrient effects were species specific and appear
   antagonistic for L. scutaria and M. capitata, but not for P. acuta.
   Larvae survivorship in all species was lowest under nitrate enrichment
   at 27 degrees C. M. capitata and L. scutaria survivorship increased at
   29 degrees C. However, positive effects of warming on survivorship were
   lost under high nitrate, but phosphate attenuated nitrate effects when
   N/P ratios were balanced. P. acuta larvae exhibited high survivorship (>
   91\%) in all treatments and showed little change in larval size, but
   lower respiration rates at 29 degrees C. Elevated nutrients (+N+P) led
   to the greatest loss in larvae size for aposymbiotic L. scutaria, while
   positive growth in symbiotic M. capitata larvae was reduced under
   warming and highest in +N+P treatments. Overall, we report a greater
   sensitivity of broadcast spawners to warming and nutrient changes
   compared to a brooding coral species. These results suggest variability
   in biological responses to warming and nutrient enrichment is influenced
   by life-history traits, including the presence of symbionts (vertical
   transmission), in addition to nutrient type and nutrient stoichiometry.},

Abstract = {Oxygen and total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) fluxes at the
   water-sediment interface were measured using benthic chambers to assess
   the short-term variations of community respiration (CR) in the back reef

   values were observed at midday and midnight. The evolution of fluxes was
   positively related to oxygen concentration in ambient water, but not to
   temperature changes. In the study area, high daytime primary production
   augments the amount of energy available for community metabolism and
   increases benthic respiration. The benthic communities are therefore
   subjected to short-term variable environmental conditions with oxygen
   supersaturation during the day, and moderately hypoxic conditions at the

   chl and/or zooxanthellae) of the scleractinian corals Stylophora
   pistillata (Esper) and Galaxea fascicularis (Linnaeus) in response to
   elevated temperature (daily temperature rises of 3-4 degrees C) over 15
   days. Feeding experiments were carried out in which the corals were
   either fed daily with zooplankton or starved. Compared to fed corals,
   starvation of both species resulted in a significant decrease in daily
   photosynthetic oxygen evolution over time. Gross (Pg) and net (Pn)
   photosynthetic production of starved corals of both species between
   10:00-11:00 hrs had declined by similar to 50\% at day 15 while there
   were no marked changes in Pg and Pn of fed corals. After 15 days,
   starved S. pistillata contained significantly lower zooxanthellae
   densities, lipid and protein concentrations than fed corals, Starved
   G.fascicularis also displayed a decrease in zooxantllae densities which
   was accompanied by a significant decline in algal chl concentrations.
   Contrary to S. pistillata, feeding treatment had no effect on the lipid
   concentrations of G. fascicularis. Total protein concentrations however
   were significantly lower in straved than in fed G.fascicularis.
   Furthermore, starvation resulted in a significant decrease in
   respiration of S. pistillata during the last four days of the experiment
   while treatment had no effect on the respiration Fates of G.
   fascicularis. Overall the oxygen consumption of S. pistillata of both
   treatments was about 39-67\% higher than the respiration of
   G.fascicularis indicating that low metabolic rates may have allowed
   Starved G. fascicularis to conserve energy reserves over the course of
   the experiment. The combined results reveal a strong positive
   relationship between food availability, Sustained photosynthetic
   activity and reduced loss in pigmentation of both species under elevated
   temperature conditions. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The effects of temperature on two reef building corals Pocillopora
   damicornis and P. verrucosa inhabiting the Obhur Creek, a small
   embayment on the western, Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia, was studied
   from December 2009 to November 2010. The overall annual range of
   seawater temperature in Obhur Creek was between 24.5 degrees C and 33
   degrees C . Zooxanthellae abundance and diversity showed seasonal
   variations: the number of zooxanthellae in P. damicornis was slightly
   higher than in P. verrucosa, and the abundance of zooxanthellae of both
   species was low in summer and high during winter. The respiration rate
   of P. verrucosa did not vary between summer and winter, suggesting
   compensatory acclimation. In contrast, the respiratory rate in P.
   damicornis was lower in winter than in summer. During the winter season
   the metabolic rate was higher in both species owing to the optimum
   seawater temperature (30 degrees C). As a result of the abundance of
   zooxanthellae and the optimum seawater temperature, the growth rates of
   the skeletons of the two coral species were higher in winter and lower
   in summer. In general, the results showed that P. verrucosa is more
   flexible with respect to temperature than P. damicornis. The difference
   in zooxanthellae thermal tolerances at 35 degrees C may be due to the
   algal genotypes between the two species, resulting in P. damicornis
   becoming bleached as the rate of metabolism exceeds the rate of
   photosynthesis with increasing temperature.},

Abstract = {Thermal performance curves describe the relationship between temperature
   and the rate of biological processes. These relationships can vary among
   species and environments, allowing organisms to acclimatize to their
   local thermal regime. This study quantified the seasonal variation in
   the thermal performance of several coral and symbiont-dominated
   physiological traits for the thermally tolerant coral species Porites
   cylindrica and the thermally sensitive coral species Acropora
   valenciennesi. Photosynthesis rates, respiration rates, maximum
   photosystem II (PSII) quantum yield and electron transport rates were
   measured in winter and summer on coral fragments exposed to an acute
   temperature increase and decrease up to 5 degrees C above and below the
   average seawater temperature in each season. Results showed that
   colonies of A. valenciennesi acclimated primarily by shifting their
   optimal temperature to a higher temperature in summer, whereas colonies
   of P. cylindrica had broader thermal breadth during summer. For
   symbionts within both species, performance was higher at all
   temperatures in summer, while the thermal optima and performance breadth
   remained unchanged. Despite these changes in thermal performance, the
   thermal optima of most traits did not match the ambient environmental
   temperature, but fell between the summer and winter temperatures.
   Overall, these results showed that both coral species were
   physiologically plastic in response to temperature change, but that
   there are constraints on the rate or capacity for acclimation that
   prevent a perfect match between the average temperature of the
   environment and the thermal optimum of the species.},

Title = {Mangrove and Seagrass Beds Provide Different Biogeochemical Services for
   Corals Threatened by Climate Change},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {Rapidly rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations are driving acidification
   in parallel with warming of the oceans. Future ocean acidification
   scenarios have the potential to impact coral growth and associated reef
   function, although reports suggest such affects could be reduced in
   adjacent seagrass habitats as a result of physio-chemical buffering.
   To-date, it remains unknown whether these habitats can actually support
   the metabolic function of a diverse range of corals. Similarly, whether
   mangroves provide the same ecological buffering service remains unclear.
   We examine whether reef-associated habitat sites (seagrass and
   mangroves) can act as potential refugia to future climate change by
   maintaining favorable chemical conditions (elevated pH and aragonite
   saturation state relative to the open-ocean), but by also assessing
   whether the metabolic function (photosynthesis, respiration and
   calcification) of important reef-building corals are sustained. We
   investigated three sites in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans and
   consistently observed that seagrass beds experience an overall elevation
   in mean pH (8.15 +/- 0.01) relative to the adjacent outer-reef (8.12 +/-
   0.03), but with periods of high and low pH. Corals in the seagrass
   habitats either sustained calcification or experienced an average
   reduction of 17.0 +/- 6.1\% relative to the outer-reef. In contrast,
   mangrove habitats were characterized by a low mean pH (8.04 +/- 0.01)
   and a relatively moderate pH range. Corals within mangrove-dominated
   habitats were thus pre-conditioned to low pH but with significant
   suppression to calcification (70.0 +/- 7.3\% reduction relative to the
   outer-reef). Both habitats also experienced more variable temperatures
   (diel range up to 2.5 degrees C) relative to the outer-reef (diel range
   less than 0.7 degrees C), which did not correspond with changes in
   calcification rates. Here we report, for the first time, the biological
   costs for corals living in reef-associated habitats and characterize the
   environmental services these habitats may play in potentially mitigating
   the local effects of future ocean acidification.},

Abstract = {Body size has large effects on organism physiology, but these effects
   remain poorly understood in modular animals with complex morphologies.
   Using two trials of a similar to 24 day experiment conducted in 2014 and
   2015, we tested the hypothesis that colony size of the coral Pocillopora
   verrucosa affects the response of calcification, aerobic respiration and
   gross photosynthesis to temperature (similar to 26.5 and similar to 29.7
   degrees C) and PCO2 (similar to 40 and similar to 1000 atm). Large
   corals calcified more than small corals, but at a slower size-specific
   rate; areanormalized calcification declined with size. Whole-colony and
   areanormalized calcification were unaffected by temperature, P-CO2, or
   the interaction between the two. Whole-colony respiration increased with
   colony size, but the slopes of these relationships differed between
   treatments. Area-normalized gross photosynthesis declined with colony
   size, but whole-colony photosynthesis was unaffected by P-CO2, and
   showed a weak response to temperature. When scaled up to predict the
   response of large corals, area-normalized metrics of physiological
   performance measured using small corals provide inaccurate estimates of
   the physiological performance of large colonies. Together, these results
   demonstrate the importance of colony size in modulating the response of
   branching corals to elevated temperature and high P-CO2},

Title = {ATP Supply May Contribute to Light-Enhanced Calcification in Corals More
   Than Abiotic Mechanisms},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Zooxanthellate corals are known to increase calcification rates when
   exposed to light, a phenomenon called light-enhanced calcification that
   is believed to be mediated by symbionts' photosynthetic activity. There
   is controversy over the mechanism behind this phenomenon, with
   hypotheses coarsely divided between abiotic and biologically-mediated
   mechanisms. At the same time, accumulating evidence shows that
   calcification in corals relies on active ion transport to deliver the
   skeleton building blocks into the calcifying medium, making it is an
   energetically costly activity. Here we build on generally accepted
   conceptual models of the coral calcification machinery and conceptual
   models of the energetics of coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis to develop a
   model that can be used to isolate the biologically-mediated and abiotic
   effects of photosynthesis, respiration, temperature, and seawater
   chemistry on coral calcification rates and related metabolic costs. We
   tested this model on data from the Mediterranean scleractinian Cladocora
   caespitosa, an acidification resistant species. We concluded that most
   of the variation in calcification rates due to photosynthesis,
   respiration and temperature can be attributed to biologically-mediated
   mechanisms, in particular to the ATP supplied to the active ion
   transports. Abiotic effects are also present but are of smaller
   magnitude. Instead, the decrease in calcification rates caused by
   acidification, albeit small, is sustained by both abiotic and
   biologically-mediated mechanisms. However, there is a substantial extra
   cost of calcification under acidified conditions. Based on these
   findings and on a literature review we suggest that the energy aspect of
   coral calcification might have been so far underappreciated.},

   increased when both stressors were combined. Coral respiration rates
   were significantly reduced by the combined stressors after 2 weeks of

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {219},
Number = {6},
Pages = {870-877},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Many organisms exhibit depressed metabolism when resources are limited,
   a change that makes it possible to balance an energy budget. For
   symbiotic reef corals, daily cycles of light and periods of intense
   cloud cover can be chronic causes of food limitation through reduced
   photosynthesis. Furthermore, coral bleaching is common in present-day
   reefs, creating a context in which metabolic depression could have
   beneficial value to corals. In the present study, corals (massive
   Porites spp.) were exposed to an extreme case of resource limitation by
   starving them of food and light for 20 days. When resources were
   limited, the corals depressed area-normalized respiration to 37\% of
   initial rates, and coral biomass declined to 64\% of initial amounts,
   yet the corals continued to produce skeletal mass. However, the declines
   in biomass cannot account for the declines in area-normalized
   respiration, as mass-specific respiration declined to 30\% of the first
   recorded time point. Thus, these corals appear to be capable of
   metabolic depression. It is possible that some coral species are better
   able to depress metabolic rates than others; such variation could
   explain differential survival during conditions that limit resources
   (e.g. shading). Furthermore, we found that maintenance of existing
   biomass, in part, supports the production of skeletal mass. This
   association could be explained if maintenance supplies needed energy
   (e.g. ATP) or inorganic carbon (i.e. CO2) that otherwise limits the
   production of skeletal mass. Finally, the observed metabolic depression
   can be explained as a change in pool sizes, and does not require a
   change in metabolic rules.},

Abstract = {In this paper I challenge the notion that a healthy and resilient coral
   is (in all cases) a fast-growing coral, and by inference, that a reef
   characterised by a fast trajectory toward high coral cover is
   necessarily a healthy and resilient reef. Instead, I explain how
   emerging evidence links fast skeletal extension rates with elevated
   coral-algae (symbiotic) respiration rates, most-often mediated by
   nutrient-enlarged symbiont populations and/or rising sea temperatures.
   Elevated respiration rates can act to reduce the autotrophic capacity
   (photosynthesis:respiration ratio) of the symbiosis. This restricts the
   capacity of the coral host to build and maintain sufficient energy
   reserves (e.g. lipids) needed to sustain essential homeostatic
   functions, including sexual reproduction and biophysical stress
   resistance. Moreover, it explains the somewhat paradoxical scenario,
   whereby at the ecological instant before the reef-building capacity of
   the symbiosis is lost, a reef can look visually at its best and be
   accreting CaCO3 at its maximum.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUL 7},
Abstract = {In the foreseeable future, coastal coral reef ecosystems are likely to
   face further increases in eutrophication. Lipids and fatty acids (FAs),
   as important components of corals, are becoming a hot topic to study the
   effects of eutrophication on corals. This study investigated the effects
   of nitrate (NO3-) enrichment (0, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mu M) on the
   respiration, photosynthesis, and FA compositions of Pocillopora
   damicornislarvae. Our results showed that saturated FAs (SFAs) were the
   most abundant in P. damicornislarvae over all treatment groups, followed
   by polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs). The unsaturated-to-SFA ratio (U/S) and
   unsaturation index (UI) reduced at low nitrate concentrations (<10 mu
   M), since the level of SFAs (mainly 16:0 and 18:0) increased whereas
   PUFAs (mainly 18:3n3, 20:3n6, and 22:6n3) decreased. Consequently, the
   biomembranes of the larvae may have become more rigid and viscous, which
   slowed excessive nitrate entry. Moreover, significantly enhanced
   photosynthetic functions of zooxanthellae in larvae were found in the N5
   group (5 mu M). However, the opposite FA patterns were observed inP.
   damicornislarvae at higher nitrate concentrations (>20 mu M). The UI and
   U/S levels were elevated due to the increased PUFAs levels and decreased
   SFA levels at higher nitrate concentrations. Compared with the N5 and
   N10 groups, the fluidity of the biomembrane of the larvae did not
   continue to decrease but instead increased at higher nitrate
   concentrations, indicating that the biomembrane restructuring in the
   larvae may have become ineffective. Moreover, respiration increased and
   the consumption of numerous lipids led to a significant decrease in
   TFAs. These could adversely affect the dispersal, settlement, and
   development of larvae. Overall,P. damicornislarvae can adapt to low
   levels of nitrate (<10 mu M) due to biomembrane restructuring through
   changes in FA composition. However, negative effects occur in larvae
   when nitrate exceeds 20 mu M.},

Abstract = {Most laboratory experiments examining the effect of ocean acidification
   on marine organisms use stable pH/pCO(2)treatments based on average
   projections for the open ocean. However, pH/pCO(2)levels vary spatially
   and temporally in marine environments, and this variation can affect
   organism responses to pH/pCO(2). On coral reefs, diel
   pH/pCO(2)variability at the individual reef scale has been reported in a
   few studies, but variation among microhabitats within a reef remains
   poorly understood. This study determined the pH/pCO(2)variability of
   three different reefs, and three contrasting coral reef microhabitats
   (dominated by hard coral, soft coral, or open substrate) within each
   reef. Three SeaFET pH loggers were deployed simultaneously at the three
   microhabitats within a reef over a 9-day period. This was repeated at
   three different reefs around the Lizard Island lagoon. The loggers
   recorded pH(T)and temperature every 5 min. Water samples were collected
   from each microhabitat during four points of the tidal cycle (high, low,
   rising, and falling) and analysed for total alkalinity and dissolved
   inorganic carbon. The data show a clear dielpCO(2)cycle, increasing
   overnight and decreasing during the day, in association with
   photosynthesis and respiration cycles. DielpCO(2)differed more between
   reefs than between microhabitats within reefs. Variation between reefs
   was most likely influenced by water flow, with the more protected (low
   flow) reefs experiencing a greater range inpCO(2)(Delta 250 mu atm) than
   the exposed (high flow) reefs (Delta 116 mu atm). These results add to a
   growing body of the literature on the diel variation ofpCO(2)of shallow,
   nearshore environments and suggest that when projecting
   futurepCO(2)levels, it is important to consider reef metabolism as well
   as physical and hydrodynamic factors.},

Abstract = {Disentangling the metabolic functioning of corals' endosymbionts
   (Symbiodiniaceae) is relevant to understanding the response of coral
   reefs to warming oceans. In this work, we first question whether there
   is an energetic coupling between photosynthesis and respiration in
   Symbiodiniaceae (Symbiodinium,DurusdiniumandEffrenium), and second, how
   different levels of energetic coupling will affect their adaptive
   responses to global warming. Coupling between photosynthesis and
   respiration was established by determining the variation of metabolic
   rates during thermal response curves, and how inhibition of respiration
   affects photosynthesis. Adaptive (irreversible) responses were studied
   by exposing twoSymbiodiniumspecies with different levels of
   photosynthesis-respiration interaction to high temperature conditions
   (32 degrees C) for 1 yr. We found that some Symbiodiniaceae have a high
   level of energetic coupling; that is, photosynthesis and respiration
   have the same temperature dependency, and photosynthesis is negatively
   affected when respiration is inhibited. Conversely, photosynthesis and
   respiration are not coupled in other species. In any case, prolonged
   exposure to high temperature caused adjustments in both photosynthesis
   and respiration, but these changes were fully reversible. We conclude
   that energetic coupling between photosynthesis and respiration exhibits
   wide variation amongst Symbiodiniaceae and does not determine the
   occurrence of adaptive responses in Symbiodiniaceae to temperature
   increase.},

Abstract = {A terminal electron acceptor alternative to mitochondrial cytochrome c
   oxidase (COX), mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX), is ubiquitous in
   higher plants and represented in nearly every algal taxon but is poorly
   documented in dinoflagellates. AOX competes for electrons with the
   conventional COX and has been hypothesized to function as a means of
   reducing oxidative stress in mitochondria, as well as a potential
   mechanism for ameliorating thermal and other physiological stressors.
   Here, the presence of an active AOX in cultured Symbiodinium was assayed
   by the response of oxygen consumption to the AOX inhibitor
   salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) and the COX inhibitor cyanide (CN).
   CN-insensitive, SHAM-sensitive oxygen consumption was found to account
   for a large portion (26 \%) of Symbiodinium dark respiration and is
   consistent with high levels of AOX activity. This experimental evidence
   of the existence of a previously unreported terminal oxidase was further
   corroborated by analysis of publicly available Symbiodinium
   transcriptome data. The potential for enhanced AOX expression to play a
   compensatory role in mediating thermal stress was supported by inhibitor
   assays of cultured Symbiodinium at low (18 A degrees C), moderate (26 A
   degrees C), and high (32 A degrees C) temperature conditions. Maximum
   capacity of the putative AOX pathway as a proportion of total dark
   oxygen consumption was found to increase from 26 \% at 26 A degrees C to
   45 \% and 53 \% at 18 A degrees C and 32 A degrees C, respectively, when
   cells were acclimated to the treatment temperatures. Cells assayed at 18
   and 32 A degrees C without acclimation exhibited either the same or
   lower AOX capacity as controls, suggesting that the AOX protein is
   upregulated under temperature stress. The physiological implications for
   the presence of AOX in the coral/algal symbiosis and its potential role
   in response to many forms of biotic and abiotic stress, particularly
   oxidative stress, are discussed.},

Abstract = {Temperate organisms are generally exposed to a more variable and cooler
   climate than tropical organisms, and are therefore expected to have
   broader thermal tolerance and a different thermal performance curve.
   This study investigated these hypotheses by comparing the thermal
   performance of two common tropical coral species found in the Great
   Barrier Reef with the two most common temperate coral species from the
   Mediterranean Sea. Photosynthesis rates, dark respiration rates, maximum
   PSII quantum yield (F-v/F-m) and electron transport rates (rETR(m)) were
   measured on coral fragments exposed to an acute temperature increase and
   decrease up to 5 degrees C above and below the average environmental
   seawater temperature. Dark respiration rates and F-v/F-m increased
   linearly with temperature, suggesting broad thermal tolerance. For
   photosynthesis and rETR(m), the performance breadths were surprisingly
   similar between the tropical and temperate species. However, the thermal
   optimum for performance was generally below the local average
   temperature, and only coincided with the prevailing environmental
   temperature for one of the tropical species. The broad thermal tolerance
   for photosynthesis displayed in this study supports previous
   observations that corals can survive short periods of abnormally warm
   temperatures and suggests that corals adopt thermal generalist
   strategies to cope with temperature variation in the environment.
   Nevertheless, current mean temperatures are 10-30\% above the thermal
   optimum for the species studied here, demonstrating that conditions are
   already pushing the boundaries of coral thermal tolerance.},

Abstract = {Bleached corals (Porites cylindrica and Galaxea fascicularis) were
   obtained through extended incubation (over 45 days) under light
   depletion and privation: low light and dark conditions, and heat stress
   (32 degrees C). The colonies in the different treatments became bleached
   and had reduced metabolic rates, photosynthesis, calcification and
   respiration; reduced biomass, zooxanthellae density, and chlorophyll a
   concentrations; and reduced mitochondrial electron transport system
   activity, which represent potential respiration rates. The most
   important reduction in mitochondrial electron transport activity was
   shown when the activities were normalized by the unit of surface and not
   by the unit of host protein. This result indicates that the reduction in
   activity could be mainly explained by the reduction of biomass and
   tissue thickness. However, increased Manganese Superoxide dismutase (Mn
   SOD) activity, a mitochondrial SOD, suggests that ROS production occurs
   in the mitochondria under heat stress with the consequence of
   potentially damaging the electron transport system. The reduced
   calcification rates observed are hypothesized to be the results of a
   decrease in the energy available for calcification due to the reduced
   photosynthetic rates, limiting the availability of substrates for
   respiration and therefore the energy production, and the decreased in
   the number of active mitochondrial electron transport system. Electron
   transport system activity associated with respiration is the basis of
   all metabolic processes and is not biased by incubation like traditional
   measurements of respiration in an aquarium. Therefore, ETSA could be
   used as an overall indicator of coral health, especially for host animal
   health. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Effects of elevated seawater temperature show high spatial heterogeneity
   and variation within and among coral species. The objective of this
   study was to investigate how two coral species, Porites lutea and
   Galaxea fascicularis, from two high latitude reefs differently exposed
   to chronic disturbance, respond to elevated seawater temperatures.
   Corals were collected from reefs nearshore (i.e. subjected to high
   sediment load, higher chlorophyll a concentrations, turbidity etc.) and
   offshore (i.e. less exposed). The corals were exposed in the lab to
   gradually increasing temperatures (25.5-33.5 degrees C) for 72 h after
   which they were allowed to recover to ambient temperature (25.5 degrees
   C) for 24 h. Production and respiration were measured after 24, 48, 72
   and 96 h. The results show that P. lutea from nearshore reefs suffered
   an initial decrease in gross primary production/respiration (GP/R) ratio
   after 24 h, after only a moderate temperature increase (+2 degrees C,
   from 25.5 to 27.5 degrees C), while there was no difference in GP/R
   ratio between heat-exposed and controls the other days, indicating that
   the chronic disturbance in the nearshore reef had no effect on their
   thermotolerance. Furthermore, P. lutea from the offshore reef showed a
   decrease in GP/R ratio both after 24 h and 72 h (33.5 degrees C) of
   exposure.
   In comparison, G. fascicularis showed a decrease in GP/R ratio after 48
   h, 72 h and 96 h of exposure for the nearshore corals. Also, after 72 h
   these corals had withdrawn their polyps. There were no differences
   between heat-treated and controls for the offshore G. fascicularis. This
   implies that the chronically disturbed G. fascicularis had lower
   thermotolerance when exposed to a temperature increase.
   This study, hence, shows that the response of corals to elevated
   seawater temperature varies with species and environmental background
   history. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Bleaching affects corals worldwide. We studied the effects of high
   seawater temperature and bacterial challenges on bleaching, metabolism,
   and antioxidant defenses of coral. The coral Montipora digitate and five
   bacterial strains (Vibrio coralliilyticus, Vibrio harveyi, Paracoccus
   carotinifaciens, Pseudoalteromonas sp., and Sulfitobacter sp.) were used
   in an inoculation experiment. The bacteria were isolated from the
   bleached corals and their surrounding seawater. At normal temperatures,
   the bacteria did not cause coral bleaching and did not affect metabolism
   or antioxidant enzyme activities. However, bacterial challenges in
   addition to high-temperature stress resulted in coral bleaching, with a
   70\% decrease in zooxanthellae density compared with the control, a 25\%
   decrease in photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm), a 66\% decrease in
   photosynthesis, and a 101\% reduction in calcification activity. Tissue
   necrosis was observed in the most compromised branches. Respiration and
   activity levels of antioxidant enzymes were not affected. Corals under
   thermal stress alone showed signs of bleaching, but the changes in
   zooxanthellae density and metabolic rates were less severe than those
   under synergistic thermal stress and bacterial challenge. Among the
   bacteria examined, Sulfitobacter sp. had a greater capacity to enhance
   and accelerate the bleaching process under thermal stress. The
   mechanisms by which bacteria affect corals are not yet understood.
   Direct actions include infection and production of toxic substances by
   bacteria; indirect effects due to changes in the bacterial community
   under the influence of added bacteria must also be considered. Our
   results suggest that bacterial challenges combined with thermal stress
   can synergistically lead to negative outcomes in corals. (C) 2012

Abstract = {Exposure to high-frequency temperature variability often but not always
   enhances coral heat tolerance, raising the question of whether this
   depends on the type of variability regime and past vs. current exposure.
   We collected corals from a macrotidal, highly fluctuating temperature
   environment and preconditioned them to either constant or variable daily
   temperatures for similar to 1.5 yr. Corals were then exposed to three
   new temperature variability regimes for similar to 1 month (constant
   control, symmetric variability, and tidal variability) to assess the
   effect of short-term environmental history, followed by a 12-d heat
   stress test. Measurements of visual coral health, photophysiology,
   photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification rates showed that
   preconditioning to constant vs. variable temperatures for 1.5 yr did not
   significantly impact coral physiology and heat tolerance. In contrast,
   environmental history experienced in the month prior to the heat stress
   test significantly influenced the physiological responses, with corals
   exposed to both types of variability having lower heat tolerance.
   Interestingly, corals in the tidal variability regime suffered greater
   health declines than in the symmetric variability regime although both
   treatments had the same cumulative heat exposure. Since heating rate and
   temperature amplitude were higher in the tidal variability regime (but
   time spent above the bleaching threshold was shorter), this suggests
   that short, extreme heat pulses may be more deleterious than longer but
   more moderate ones, though other factors likely also played a role.
   Overall, our findings demonstrate that daily temperature variability has
   significant potential to alter coral heat tolerance but only certain
   types of variability may enhance coral adaptive capacity.},

Title = {Widespread oxyregulation in tropical corals under hypoxia},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {179},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Hypoxia (low oxygen stress) is increasingly reported on coral reefs,
   caused by ocean deoxygenation linked to coastal nutrient pollution and
   ocean warming. While the ability to regulate respiration is a key driver
   of hypoxia tolerance in many other aquatic taxa, corals' oxyregulatory
   capabilities remain virtually unexplored. Here, we examine
   O2-consumption patterns across 17 coral species under declining O2
   partial pressure (pO2). All corals showed ability to oxyregulate, but
   total positive regulation (Tpos) varied between species, ranging from
   0.41 (Pocillopora damicornis) to 2.42 (P. acuta). On average, corals
   performed maximum regulation effort (Pcmax) at low pO2 (30\% air
   saturation, corresponding to lower O2 levels measured on natural reef
   systems), and exhibited detectable regulation down to as low as <10\%
   air saturation. Our study shows that corals are not oxyconformers as
   previously thought, suggesting oxyregulation is likely important for
   survival in dynamic O2 environments of shallow coral reefs subjected to
   hypoxic events.},

Abstract = {Establishing the thermal reaction norm of coral larvae under elevated
   pCO(2) is crucial to anticipate how larval dispersal and population
   maintenance may be affected by future climate change. Here, we
   characterized the functional relationship between temperature (27-33
   degrees C) and larval performance of the reef coral Pocillopora
   damicornis under two pCO(2) levels. The results showed that the
   temperature threshold of larvae was between 32 and 33 degrees C, as
   evidenced by the abrupt declines in photochemical efficiency and
   symbiont density, whereas no oxidative damage was observed between 27
   and 33 degrees C and elevated pCO(2) did not influence any of these
   parameters. In addition, larval respiration and photosynthesis rates
   exhibited parabolic responses to temperature, and this relationship
   conformed to the Gaussian-Gompertz model with an optimal temperature
   around 31.5 degrees C, which was approximately 2.5 degrees C above the
   summer mean temperature, suggesting the potential for thermal
   acclimation. Most importantly, elevated pCO(2) significantly enhanced
   the larval photosynthesis and the stimulatory effect of elevated pCO(2)
   on the photosynthetic rates and capacity was more pronounced in cool and
   warm temperatures, indicative of shifted thermal sensitivity under high
   pCO(2). These results suggest that ocean acidification could alter the
   thermal performance curves and tolerance window of brooded P. damicornis
   larvae, with profound and important implications for larval ecology in a

Abstract = {Coral skeletal Ba/Ca is a proxy for seawater Ba/Ca, used to infer
   oceanic upwelling and terrigenous runoff while {[}Mg2+] is implicated in
   the control of coral biomineralisation. We cultured large individuals
   (>12 cm diameter) of 3 genotypes of massive adult Porites spp. corals
   over a range of seawater pCO(2) to test how atmospheric CO2 variations
   affect skeletal Ba/Ca and Mg/Ca. We identified the skeleton deposited
   after a 5 month acclimation period and analysed the skeletal Ba/Ca and
   Mg/Ca by secondary ion mass spectrometry. Skeletal Mg/Ca varies
   significantly between some duplicate colonies of the same coral genotype
   hampering identification of genotype and seawater pCO(2) effects. Coral
   aragonite:seawater Ba/Ca partition coefficients (K-D Ba/Ca) do not vary
   significantly between duplicate colonies of the same coral genotype. We
   observe large variations in K-D Ba/Ca between different massive Porites
   spp. coral genotypes irrespective of seawater pCO(2). These variations
   do not correlate with coral calcification, photosynthesis or respiration
   rates or with skeletal K-D Mg/Ca or K-D Sr/Ca. Seawater pCO(2) does not
   significantly affect K-D Ba/Ca in 2 genotypes but K-D Ba/Ca is
   significantly higher at 750 atm seawater pCO(2) than at 180 mu atm in 1
   P. lutea genotype. Genotype specific variations in K-D Ba/Ca between
   different Porites spp. could yield large errors (similar to 250\%) in
   reconstructions of seawater Ba when comparing Ba/Ca between corals.
   Analysis of fossil coral specimens deposited at low seawater pCO(2), may
   underestimate past seawater Ba/Ca and ocean upwelling/freshwater inputs
   when compared with modern specimens but the effect is small in

Title = {The physiological response of the deep-sea coral Solenosmilia variabilis
   to ocean acidification},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {Several forms of calcifying scleractinian corals provide important
   habitat complexity in the deep-sea and are consistently associated with
   a high biodiversity of fish and other invertebrates. How these corals
   may respond to the future predicted environmental conditions of ocean
   acidification is poorly understood, but any detrimental effects on these
   marine calcifiers will have wider impacts on the ecosystem. Colonies of
   Solenosmilia variabilis, a protected deep-sea coral commonly occurring
   throughout the New Zealand region, were collected during a cruise in
   March 2014 from the Louisville Seamount Chain. Over a 12-month period,
   samples were maintained in temperature controlled (similar to 3.5
   degrees C) continuous flow-through tanks at a seawater pH that reflects
   the region's current conditions (7.88) and an end-of-century scenario
   (7.65). Impacts on coral growth and the intensity of colour saturation
   (as a proxy for the coenenchyme tissue that covers the coral exoskeleton
   and links the coral polyps) were measured bimonthly. In addition,
   respiration rate was measured after a mid-term (six months) and
   long-term (12 months) exposure period. Growth rates were highly
   variable, ranging from 0.53 to 3.068 mm year(-1) and showed no
   detectable difference between the treatment and control colonies.
   Respiration rates also varied independently of pH and ranged from 0.065
   to 1.756 mu mol O-2 g protein(-1) h(-1). A significant change in colour
   was observed in the treatment group over time, indicating a loss of
   coenenchyme. This loss was greatest after 10 months at 5.28\% and could
   indicate a reallocation of energy with physiological processes (e.g.
   growth and respiration) being maintained at the expense of coenenchyme
   production. This research illustrates important first steps to assessing
   and understanding the sensitivity of deep-sea corals to ocean
   acidification.},

Title = {Metabolic significance of temperature-dependent changes in annual
   resolution coral delta C-13 from the South China Sea during the
   mid-Holocene},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {33},

Abstract = {The complicated effects of climatic and environmental conditions on
   coral delta C-13 have hindered its use as a universal proxy for
   biological activity and climate change. Changes in annual resolution
   delta C-13 levels from the South China Sea (SCS) were studied to explore
   the biological and climatic significance of coral delta C-13 during the
   mid-Holocene. The growth-rate-related kinetic isotope effect on modern
   coral delta C-13 may be limited, site- and/or colony-specific.
   Furthermore, coral delta C-13 and sea surface temperatures (SST) are
   inversely related, but their correlation is weak. These results suggest
   the influence of complicated controlling factors on modern coral delta
   C-13. As for the mid-Holocene corals, no obvious growth-rate-related
   kinetic isotope effect has been found in their coral delta C-13 series,
   and the effect of solar irradiation on coral delta C-13 is difficult to
   directly evaluate for the low resolution of reconstructed solar records
   and the dating errors. However, mid-Holocene coral delta C-13 series
   show temperature-dependent changes over the studied periods during
   6100-6500 yr BP. The significant negative correlation between coral
   delta C-13 and SST has been attributed to the high SSTs during the
   mid-Holocene. This is based on the observation that coral delta C-13 and
   the photosynthesis to respiration ratio (P/R) are usually positively
   related, but P/R is significantly and negatively related to temperature
   under high temperature conditions in that photosynthetic activity of
   heat-stressed corals will drastically reduce due to the decreases of
   population density and photosynthetic rate of the zooxanthellae. (C)

Title = {Metabolic tolerance of the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa

Abstract = {Lophelia pertusa is the world's most common and widespread
   framework-forming cold-water coral. It forms deep-water coral reefs and
   carbonate mounds supporting diverse animal communities on the
   continental shelf and on seamounts. These recently discovered ecosystems
   have been damaged by deep-sea fishing and are threatened by predicted
   shallowing of the aragonite saturation horizon. Despite this, very
   little is known about the ecophysiology of L. pertusa and its likely
   response to environmental changes. Here we describe the first study of
   the respiratory physiology of L. pertusa and the effects of altered
   temperature and oxygen level. This study shows that L. pertusa can
   maintain respiratory independence over a range Of PO2 illustrated by a
   high regulation value (R=78\%). The critical PO2 value of 9-10 kPa is
   very similar to the lower values of oxygen concentration recorded in the
   field. This suggests that oxygen level may be a limiting factor in the
   distribution of this cold-water coral. L. pertusa survived periods of
   anoxia (I h), hypoxia (up to 96 h), but high Q(10) values revealed
   sensitivity to short-term temperature changes (6.5-11 degrees C. For the
   first time vital data have been gathered on the physiology of this
   species that is essential to understand distribution and underpin future
   climate change studies. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Acclimatization to high-variance habitats does not enhance physiological
   tolerance of two key Caribbean corals to future temperature and pH},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {283},

Month = {MAY 25},
Abstract = {Corals are acclimatized to populate dynamic habitats that neighbour
   coral reefs. Habitats such as seagrass beds exhibit broad diel changes
   in temperature and pH that routinely expose corals to conditions
   predicted for reefs over the next 50-100 years. However, whether such
   acclimatization effectively enhances physiological tolerance to, and
   hence provides refuge against, future climate scenarios remains unknown.
   Also, whether corals living in low-variance habitats can tolerate
   present-day high-variance conditions remains untested. We experimentally
   examined how pH and temperature predicted for the year 2100 affects the
   growth and physiology of two dominant Caribbean corals (Acropora palmata
   and Porites astreoides) native to habitats with intrinsically low
   (outer-reef terrace, LV) and/or high (neighbouring seagrass, HV)
   environmental variance. Under present-day temperature and pH, growth and
   metabolic rates (calcification, respiration and photosynthesis) were
   unchanged for HV versus LV populations. Superimposing future climate
   scenarios onto the HV and LV conditions did not result in any enhanced
   tolerance to colonies native to HV. Calcification rates were always
   lower for elevated temperature and/or reduced pH. Together, these
   results suggest that seagrass habitats may not serve as refugia against
   climate change if the magnitude of future temperature and pH changes is
   equivalent to neighbouring reef habitats.},

Title = {Variability of skeletal growth and delta C-13 in massive corals from the
   South China Sea: Effects of photosynthesis, respiration and human
   activities},
Journal = {CHEMICAL GEOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {255},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {414-425},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {The delta C-13, skeletal density and extension rates were analyzed along
   same growth axes of massive coral colonies collected from the shallow
   sea to the east and south of Hainan Island, northern South China Sea.
   Seasonal changes of delta C-13, extension and calcification rates of
   Porites lutea and Porites lobata are in phase and correlated with solar
   radiation. In addition, annual high delta C-13 values, extension and
   calcification rates occur in spring and low values and rates occur in
   late autumn or early winter. The annual highest density band of P. lutea
   formed in spring and the lowest ones in early winter, whereas R lobata
   shows only a weak seasonal density change. We suggest that the seasonal
   features of the coral delta C-13, extension and calcification rates are
   modulated by light-induced photosynthesis determined by solar radiation
   reaching the top of the atmosphere, and by cloud coverage. The results
   also support the suggestion that photosynthesis promotes both the
   extension growth and skeleton thickening for P. lutea, but that it
   mainly promotes the extension growth for P. lobata. Remarkable
   inter-decadal trends are evident in the coral records; these trends are
   progressive decreases of skeletal delta C-13, density and calcification
   rate, and an increase of the extension rate over the last 30 years,
   which are marked by abrupt changes at about 1987. These trends are
   ascribed to intensified coral respiration arising from rising
   temperature, together with the effects of declining nutrient levels
   caused by the destruction of the coastal ecosystem in the sampling
   regions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The respective role of environmental and physiological controls on the
   isotopic composition of coral skeletons is a matter of debate. It has
   been shown that delta(13)C can be affected by light, seawater
   delta(13)C(DIC), nutrition, respiration. spawning, pH and temperature.
   We investigated the effect of light on photosynthesis, respiration.
   calcification, and stable isotope composition (delta(13)C and
   delta(18)O) of the skeleton in the zooxanthellate scleractinian corals
   Acropora sp. and Stylophora pistillata. Colonies were grown on glass
   slides under controlled conditions in the laboratory at low and high
   light (LL and HL: 132 and 258 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1)). The average
   net photosynthesis of Acropora sp. was significantly higher under HL
   than under LL. The difference was not statistically significant for S.
   pistillata. The respiration rate did not change significantly in both
   species under the two light conditions. The calcification rate of S.
   pistillata under HL was 17-fold higher than under LL and 2.5-fold higher
   for Acropora sp. The average skeletal delta(13)C and 5180 of Acropora
   sp. were significantly more negative under LL than under HL. For S.
   pistillata, skeletal delta(18)O was significantly more negative in the
   LL than in the HL condition. The delta(13)C value of the skeleton
   deposited under LL was also more negative than under HL, although the
   difference was not statistically significant. The skeletal delta(13)C
   was significantly correlated with the rate of calcification. both in LL
   and HL. No correlation was found between skeletal 513 C and the
   following other physiological parameters: net and gross photosynthesis
   (P-n and P-g), respiration (R), and the P-g/R ratio. The increase of
   skeletal delta(13)C With increasing light seems to support the model of
   Goreau (1977). Zooxanthellae mostly fix C-12 under HL, leading to an
   increased concentration of C-13 in the common carbon pool which supplies
   dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) for calcification. Hence. the skeleton
   deposited is isotopically enriched in C-13. This general model needs
   revision to accommodate the recent finding that calcification and
   photosynthesis draw carbon from two reservoirs (seawater and metabolic
   DIC). and that respiratory CO2 is the major source of DIC for
   calcification. It is suggested that zooxanthellae mostly fix C-12{[}DIC]
   in LL; the organic matter respired, the CO2 released, and the CaCO3
   deposited being therefore isotopically light. Under HL condition.
   zooxanthellar photosynthesis uses both {[}C-12]- and {[}C-13]DIC. The
   photosynthetic products catabolized by the coral, as well the
   respiratory CO2 and the CaCO3 precipitated are therefore heavier. (C)

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS EARTH \& ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Ocean warming is transforming the world's coral reefs, which are
   governed by the growth of marine calcifiers, most notably branching
   corals. Critical to skeletal growth is the corals' regulation of their
   internal chemistry to promote calcification. Here we investigate the
   effects of temperature and light on the calcifying fluid chemistry
   (using boron isotope systematics), calcification rates, metabolic rates
   and photo-physiology of Acropora nasuta during two mesocosm experiments
   simulating seasonal and static temperature and light regimes. Under the
   seasonal regime, coral calcification rates, calcifying fluid carbonate
   chemistry, photo-physiology and metabolic productivity responded to both
   changes in temperature and light. However, under static conditions the
   artificially prolonged exposure to summer temperatures resulted in heat
   stress and a heightened sensitivity to light. Our results indicate that
   temperature and light effects on coral physiology and calcification
   mechanisms are interactive and context-specific, making it essential to
   conduct realistic multi-variate dynamic experiments in order to predict
   how coral calcification will respond to ocean warming.
   Corals show a heightened sensitivity to a combination of light and
   thermal stress after prolonged exposure to high ocean temperatures,
   according to four months-long mesocosm experiments that disentangle the
   effects of light and ocean warming.},

   decreased ranging from 5\% to 100\% when these corals were exposed to
   different temperatures and salinities. Temperature also significantly
   affected coral growth and survival. However, corals exposed to changes
   in salinity showed higher survivorship than those exposed to changes in

Abstract = {High-latitude coral communities are distinct from their tropical
   counterparts, and how they respond to recent heat wave events that have
   decimated tropical reefs remains unknown. In Australia, the 2016 El Nino
   resulted in the largest global mass coral bleaching event to date,
   reaching as far south as Sydney Harbour (similar to 34 degrees S). Coral
   bleaching was observed for the first time (affecting ca., 60\% of all
   corals) as sea surface temperatures in Sydney Harbour remained > 2
   degrees C above the long-term mean summer maxima, enabling us to examine
   whether high-latitude corals bleached in a manner described for tropical
   corals. Responses of the geographically cosmopolitan Plesiastrea
   versipora and southerly restricted Coscinaraea mcneilli were contrasted
   across two harbour sites, both in situ and among samples-maintained ex
   situ in aquaria continually supplied with Sydney Harbour seawater. While
   both coral taxa hosted the same species of microalgal endosymbiont
   (Breviolum spp; formerly clade B), only P. versipora bleached both in
   situ and ex situ via pronounced losses of endosymbiont cells. Both
   species displayed very different metabolic responses (growth,
   photosynthesis, respiration and calcification) and bleaching
   susceptibilities under elevated temperatures. Bacterial microbiome
   profiling, however, revealed a convergence of bacterial community
   composition across coral species throughout the bleaching. Corals
   species found in temperate regions, including the generalist P.
   versipora, will therefore likely be highly susceptible to future change
   as heat waves grow in frequency and severity unless their thermal
   thresholds increase. Our observations provide further evidence that
   high-latitude systems are susceptible to community reorganisation under
   climate change.},

Abstract = {White syndrome (WS) is a collective term for coral diseases that cause
   acute tissue loss, resulting in apparently healthy tissue bordering on
   exposed skeleton. In this study, the microenvironmental condition and
   tissue structure of WS-affected tabular acroporid corals were assessed
   by O(2) microelectrodes and histological techniques. The high spatial
   resolution of the microelectrode measurements enabled an evaluation of
   the extent of physiological changes at, and 2 cm away from, the WS
   border. Respiration of the coral host was decreased on the
   skeleton-tissue border but was comparable to that of healthy corals only
   2 cm away from the border. Histological data, however, showed a decrease
   in mesogloea thickness on and 2 cm away from the WS border, which
   correlates with a previously observed allocation of photoassimilates
   away from the WS border. We suggest that there are colony-wide negative
   effects of WS which affect only the host physiology and, as disparate
   etiologies are evident in WS, these must be distinguished through the
   utilization of a multiple tool approach.},

Abstract = {Topshell Tectus pyramis is a coral reef snail of economic and ecological
   value. This study assessed temperature and salinity tolerance in T.
   pyramis and the interaction between temperature and salinity on
   metabolism. The adaptability of T. pyramis was assessed with mortality,
   respiration, and nitrogen excretion. This study found that snail (T.
   pyramis) with body sizes of width 60.30 +/- 3.46, 40.12 +/- 2.34, and
   20.02 +/- 1.15 mm tolerated temperatures of 15-35, 15-35, and 20-30
   degrees C and salinity of 13-38, 18-38, and 23-33 parts per thousand,
   respectively. It demonstrates that larger snails can adapt better to
   variations in temperature and salinity. Temperature and salinity have a
   significant effect on the metabolism of snails. Smaller snails have a
   higher metabolism and are more sensitive to changes in temperature and
   salinity. Overall, results suggest that seawater with 30 degrees C
   temperature and 33 parts per thousand salinity was suitable for T.

Title = {Coral-macroalgal competition under ocean warming and acidification},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {534},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Competition between corals and macroalgae is frequently observed on
   reefs with the outcome of these interactions affecting the relative
   abundance of reef organisms and therefore reef health. Anthropogenic
   activities have resulted in increased atmospheric CO2 levels and a
   subsequent rise in ocean temperatures. In addition to increasing water
   temperature, elevated CO2 levels are leading to a decrease in oceanic pH
   (ocean acidification). These two changes have the potential to alter
   ecological processes within the oceans, including the outcome of
   competitive coral-macroalgal interactions. In our study, we explored the
   combined effect of temperature increase and ocean acidification on the
   competition between the coral Porites lobata and on the Great Barrier
   Reef abundant macroalga Chlorodesmis fastigiata. A temperature increase
   of +1 degrees C above present temperatures and CO2 increase of +85 ppm
   were used to simulate a low end emission scenario for the mid- to late
   21st century, according to the Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6
   (RCP2.6). Our results revealed that the net photosynthesis of P. lobata
   decreased when it was in contact with C. fastigiata under ambient
   conditions, and that dark respiration increased under RCP2.6 conditions.
   The Photosynthesis to Respiration (P:R) ratios of corals as they
   interacted with macroalgal competitors were not significantly different
   between scenarios. Dark calcification rates of corals under RCP2.6
   conditions, however, were negative and significantly decreased compared
   to ambient conditions. Light calcification rates were negatively
   affected by the interaction of macroalgal contact in the RCP2.6
   scenario, compared to algal mimics and to coral under ambient
   conditions. Chlorophyll a, and protein content increased in the RCP2.6
   scenario, but were not influenced by contact with the macroalga. We
   conclude that the coral host was negatively affected by RCP2.6
   conditions, whereas the productivity of its symbionts (zooxanthellae)
   was enhanced. While a negative effect of the macroalga (C. fastigiata)
   on the coral (P. lobata) was observed for the P:R ratio under control
   conditions, it was not enhanced under RCP2.6 conditions.},

Abstract = {Physiological sensitivity of cold-water corals to ocean change is far
   less understood than of tropical corals and very little is known about
   the impacts of ocean acidification and warming on degradative processes
   of dead coral framework. In a 13-month laboratory experiment, we
   examined the interactive effects of gradually increasing temperature and
   pCO(2) levels on survival, growth, and respiration of two prominent
   color morphotypes (colormorphs) of the framework-forming cold-water
   coral Lophelia pertusa, as well as bioerosion and dissolution of dead
   framework. Calcification rates tended to increase with warming, showing
   temperature optima at similar to 14 degrees C (white colormorph) and
   10-12 degrees C (orange colormorph) and decreased with increasing
   pCO(2). Net dissolution occurred at aragonite undersaturation (Omega(Ar)
   < 1 ) at similar to 1000 mu atm pCO(2). Under combined warming and
   acidification, the negative effects of acidification on growth were
   initially mitigated, but at similar to 1600 mu atm dissolution
   prevailed. Respiration rates increased with warming, more strongly in
   orange corals, while acidification slightly suppressed respiration.
   Calcification and respiration rates as well as polyp mortality were
   consistently higher in orange corals. Mortality increased considerably
   at 14-15 degrees C in both colormorphs. Bioerosion/dissolution of dead
   framework was not affected by warming alone but was significantly
   enhanced by acidification. While live corals may cope with intermediate
   levels of elevated pCO(2) and temperature, long-term impacts beyond
   levels projected for the end of this century will likely lead to
   skeletal dissolution and increased mortality. Our findings further
   suggest that acidification causes accelerated degradation of dead
   framework even at aragonite saturated conditions, which will eventually
   compromise the structural integrity of cold-water coral reefs.},

   exposed to ocean acidification and experimentally elevated temperatures},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {700},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Ocean acidification (OA) and warming currently threaten coastal
   ecosystems across the globe. However, it is possible that the former
   process could actually benefit marine plants, such as seagrasses. The
   purpose of this study was to examine whether the effects of the seagrass
   Thalassia hemprichii can increase the resilience of OA-challenged coral
   reef mesocosms whose temperatures were gradually elevated. It was found
   that seagrass shoot density, photosynthetic efficiency, and leaf growth
   rate actually increased with rising temperatures under OA. Macroalgal
   growth rates were higher in the seagrass-free mesocosms, but the
   calcification rate of the model reef coral Pocillopora damicomis was
   higher in coral reef mesocosms featuring seagrasses under OA at 25 and
   28 degrees C. Both the macroalgal growth rate and the coral
   calcification rate decreased in all mesocosms when the temperature was
   raised to 31 degrees C under OA. However, the variation in gross primary
   production, ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem production in the
   seagrass mesocosms was lower than in seagrass-free controls, suggesting
   that the presence of seagrass in the mesocosms helped to stabilize the
   metabolism of the system in response to simulated climate change. (C)

Title = {Light availability determines susceptibility of reef building corals to

Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {32},
Number = {2},
Pages = {327-337},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Elevated seawater pCO(2), and in turn ocean acidification (OA), is now
   widely acknowledged to reduce calcification and growth of reef building
   corals. As with other environmental factors (e.g., temperature and
   nutrients), light availability fundamentally regulates calcification and
   is predicted to change for future reef environments alongside elevated
   pCO(2) via altered physical processes (e.g., sea level rise and
   turbidity); however, any potential role of light in regulating the
   OA-induced reduction of calcification is still unknown. We employed a
   multifactorial growth experiment to determine how light intensity and
   pCO(2) together modify calcification for model coral species from two
   key genera, Acropora horrida and Porites cylindrica, occupying similar
   ecological niches but with different physiologies. We show that elevated
   pCO(2) (OA)-induced losses of calcification in the light (G (L)) but not
   darkness (G (D)) were greatest under low-light growth conditions, in
   particular for A. horrida. High-light growth conditions therefore
   dampened the impact of OA upon G (L) but not G (D). Gross photosynthesis
   (P (G)) responded in a reciprocal manner to G (L) suggesting OA-relieved
   pCO(2) limitation of P (G) under high-light growth conditions to
   effectively enhance G (L). A multivariate analysis of past OA
   experiments was used to evaluate whether our test species responses were
   more widely applicable across their respective genera. Indeed, the light
   intensity for growth was identified as a significant factor influencing
   the OA-induced decline of calcification for species of Acropora but not
   Porites. Whereas low-light conditions can provide a refuge for hard
   corals from thermal and light stress, our study suggests that lower
   light availability will potentially increase the susceptibility of key
   coral species to OA.},

Title = {Net Community Metabolism and Seawater Carbonate Chemistry Scale
   Non-intuitively with Coral Cover},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {Coral cover and reef health have been declining globally as reefs face
   local and global stressors including higher temperature and ocean
   acidification (OA). Ocean warming and acidification will alter rates of
   benthic reef metabolism (i.a, primary production, respiration,
   calcification, and CaCO3 dissolution), but our understanding of
   community and ecosystem level responses is limited in terms of
   functional, spatial, and temporal scales. Furthermore, dramatic changes
   in coral cover and benthic metabolism could alter seawater carbonate
   chemistry on coral reefs, locally alleviating or exacerbating OA. This
   study examines how benthic metabolic rates scale with changing coral
   cover (0-100\%), and the subsequent influence of these coral communities
   on seawater carbonate chemistry based on mesocosm experiments in Bermuda
   and Hawaii. In Bermuda, no significant differences in benthic metabolism
   or seawater carbonate chemistry were observed for low (40\%) and high
   (80\%) coral cover due to large variability within treatments. In
   contrast, significant differences were detected between treatments in
   Hawaii with benthic metabolic rates increasing with increasing coral
   cover. Observed increases in daily net community calcification and
   nighttime net respiration scaled proportionally with coral cover. This
   was not true for daytime net community organic carbon production rates,
   which increased the most between 0 and 20\% coral cover and then less so
   between 20 and 100\%. Consequently, diel variability in seawater
   carbonate chemistry increased with increasing coral cover, but absolute
   values of pH, Omega(a), and pCO(2) were not significantly different
   during daytime. To place the results of the mesocosm experiments into a
   broader context, in situ seawater carbon dioxide (CO2) at three reef
   sites in Bermuda and Hawaii were also evaluated; reefs with higher coral
   cover experienced a greater range of diel CO2 levels, complementing the
   mesocosm results. The results from this study highlight the need to
   consider the natural complexity of reefs and additional biological and
   physical factors that influence seawater carbonate chemistry on larger
   spatial and longer temporal scales. Coordinated efforts combining
   various research approaches (e.g., experiments, field studies, and
   models) will be required to better understand how benthic metabolism
   integrates across functional, spatial, and temporal scales, and for
   making predictions on how coral reefs will respond to climate change.},

   SCIENCES \& TECHNOLOGIES},

Abstract = {This research focused on the effect of salinity and nitrate on coral
   health levels in hump coral (Porites sp.). The corals incubated under
   salinity vary in 15, 20, 25, and 30 psu, and nitrate vary in 5, 20, 60,
   and 100 mu g-N/l with triplicate experiments. The experimental results
   showed that the range of salinity in 20, 25 and 30 psu at 120 hours was
   unable to calculate LC50 (Lethal Concentration) because of insufficient
   in motility percentage. However, the results showed that 15 psu of
   salinity at 120 hours was able to calculate LC50 using Probit analysis.
   LC50 in 15 psu of salinity at 120 hours was equally to 105.40 mu g-N/l.
   The loss of Zooxanthellae from coral tissues could observe by the change
   in color as coral slowly turning into paling color but there were no
   releasing mucus and tissue damage as tissue sloughed-off observed in any
   treatments in this study because of the highly tolerant to reduced
   salinity and high nitrate in Porites sp. The experimental results showed
   that the corals incubated under separately high nitrate or reduced
   salinity treatment indicated an increased amount of loss of
   Zooxanthellae. Then, the combination of salinity and nitrate exposure in
   coral can create more stressful conditions and adversely affect coral
   health status than exposure to salinity or nitrate alone.

Abstract = {Different substrates in a Philippine coral reef - sand, rubble, and
   living coral of the family Fungiidae - were monitored over a 2 yr period
   to compare their energy turnover and to determine possible diurnal and
   seasonal patterns. The metabolism of all 3 components did not vary
   significantly over the times of day between 09:00 and 15:00 h, and
   showed relatively small fluctuations with season. Within the narrow
   ranges of variation, light was positively correlated with primary
   production of coral, rubble and sand. Temperature increased coral
   respiration significantly. Higher production of rubble and sand
   communities occurred during times of lowered salinity, and was probably
   due to increased levels of nutrients associated with the rainy season.
   Respiration of all 3 substrates was elevated during the wet months,
   indicating stress related to lowered salinities. The various substrates
   differed significantly in terms of energy production and consumption,
   with coral showing the highest metabolic rate and P/R > 1, followed by
   rubble with P/R approximate to 1, then sand with P/R slightly less than
   1. These results indicate that the net productivity of the system is
   made possible by the coral contribution, a finding which confirms

Abstract = {The effects of multiple stressors on the early life stages of
   reef-building corals are poorly understood. Elevated temperature is the
   main physiological driver of mass coral bleaching events, but increasing
   evidence suggests that other stressors, including elevated dissolved
   inorganic nitrogen (DIN), may exacerbate the negative effects of thermal
   stress. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the performance of
   larvae of Orbicella faveolata and Porites astreoides, two important
   Caribbean reef coral species with contrasting reproductive and algal
   transmission modes, under increased temperature and/or elevated DIN. We
   used a fluorescence-based microplate respirometer to measure the oxygen
   consumption of coral larvae from both species, and also assessed the
   effects of these stressors on P. astreoides larval settlement and
   mortality. Overall, we found that (1) larvae increased their respiration
   in response to different factors (O. faveolata in response to elevated
   temperature and P. astreoides in response to elevated nitrate) and (2)
   P. astreoides larvae showed a significant increase in settlement as a
   result of elevated nitrate, but higher mortality under elevated
   temperature. This study shows how microplate respirometry can be
   successfully used to assess changes in respiration of coral larvae, and
   our findings suggest that the effects of thermal stress and nitrate
   enrichment in coral larvae may be species specific and are neither
   additive nor synergistic for O. faveolata or P. astreoides. These
   findings may have important consequences for the recruitment and
   community reassembly of corals to nutrient-polluted reefs that have been
   impacted by climate change.},

Abstract = {Seawater temperature is one of the main variables that determines
   cold-water coral distribution worldwide. As part of an initiative to
   explore new areas of deep-sea habitats along the Southeast United States
   (SEUS) continental margin, a series of expeditions were carried out as
   part of the Deep-Sea Exploration to Advance Research on
   Corals/Canyons/Cold seeps (DEEP SEARCH) project. During these
   explorations, a cold-water coral reef complex composed mainly of
   Lophelia pertusa was located off the coast of South Carolina at 650-850
   m depth. In this geographic area the species normally has a thermal
   tolerance between 6 and 12 degrees C with the capacity to form extensive
   calcium carbonate structures, thus creating complex habitat for a
   variety of associated species. Owing to the paucity of these structures
   and the unusual environmental conditions of this geographic area, with
   regular arrival of warm surface waters from the Gulf Stream, the main
   aim of this study was to understand the physiological response of L.
   pertusa to the variation in extreme temperature events in this region.
   Short-term experiments simulated the rate of temperature increase from
   the ambient temperature (8 degrees C) to the environmental maximum (14
   degrees C) (heat-wave treatment). We found that temperature had a
   significant effect on the metabolic functions through an increase in
   respiration (0.108 to 0.247 mu mol O-2 g(-1)DW h(-1)) and excretion
   rates (0.002 to 0.011 mu mol NH3 g(-1)DW h(-1)) at 14 degrees C. Oxygen
   to Nitrogen ratios (O:N) also showed an effect of temperature where
   corals switched from lipid-dominated toward a mix of lipid-protein and
   protein-dominated catabolism. To further characterize the metabolic
   response, feeding assays (capture rate of Artemia) were performed at the
   same temperature range with an overall three-fold decrease in capture
   rates under 14 degrees C compared to ambient temperature, thus
   increasing the probability of temperature-induced metabolic stress. Our
   results suggest that temperature variations affect the metabolic
   response of cold-water corals, particularly along the SEUS continental
   margin. Since the incursion of warm surface water to deeper zones is
   predicted to increase in frequency and duration due to climate change,
   L. pertusa may be implicated negatively, followed by ecological
   consequences for the survival and functionality for the ecosystem it
   supports.},

Abstract = {Ocean warming and acidification can have negative implications on coral
   reefs. This mechanistic study aims to evaluate the proximal causes of
   the observed negative response of Hawaiian corals to climate change
   scenarios. Net calcification (G(net)), gross photosynthesis, and dark
   respiration were measured in three species of Hawaiian corals across a
   range of temperature and acidification regimes using endpoint
   incubations. Calcification rates showed a curvilinear response with
   temperature, with the highest calcification rates observed at 26 degrees
   C. Coral response to ocean acidification (OA) was species dependent and
   highly variable. OA enhanced calcification rates by 45\% in the
   perforate coral, Montipora capitata, but had no short-term effect on the
   calcification or photosynthetic rates of imperforate corals, Pocillopora
   damicornis or Leptastrea purpurea. Further investigations revealed M.
   capitata to effectively dissipate protons (H+) while increasing uptake
   of bicarbonate (HCO3-), therefore maintaining high rates of G(net) under
   acute OA stress. This study demonstrates the first experimental evidence
   of the ability of a coral species to take advantage of increased
   dissolved inorganic carbon and overcome an increasing proton gradient in
   the boundary layer under OA conditions. These observed differences in

Abstract = {Species have evolved different mechanisms to cope with spatial and
   temporal temperature variability. Species with broad geographical
   distributions may be thermal generalists that perform well across a
   broad range of temperatures, or they might contain subpopulations of
   locally adapted thermal specialists. We quantified the variation in
   thermal performance of two coral species, Porites cylindrica and
   Acropora spp., along a latitudinal gradient over which temperature
   varies by approximately 68 degrees C. Photosynthesis rates, respiration
   rates, maximum quantum yield and maximum electron transport rates were
   measured on coral fragments exposed to an acute temperature increase and
   decrease up to 58 degrees C above and below the local average
   temperature. Results showed geographical variation in the performance
   curves of both species at holobiont and symbiont level, but this did not
   lead to an alignment of the optimal temperature for performance with the
   average temperature of the local environment, suggesting suboptimal
   coral performance of these coral populations in summer. Furthermore,
   symbiont thermal performance generally had an optimum closer to the
   average environmental temperature than holobiont performance, suggesting
   that symbionts have a higher capacity for acclimatization than the coral
   host, and can aid the coral host when temperatures are unfavourable.

Abstract = {Coral reefs are on the brink of collapse from global warming and
   associated coral bleaching. Coral bleaching is the loss of algal
   symbionts from the coral tissue. The reduction in photosynthates
   produced by the symbionts makes the survival of the coral dependent on
   heterotrophy and stored resources, which are catabolized into available
   energy, i.e., Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). The present study examined
   how an increase in water temperature affects energetic reserves and
   available ATP in the Red Sea coral Stylophora pistillata. Following a
   9-d hold at 1, 3, 5 degrees C above ambient summer temperature (similar
   to 26 degrees C), ATP levels in the coral tissue remained constant.
   Similarly, no significant differences in the stored energy (proteins,
   carbohydrates, and lipids) of the holobiont were measured. However, half
   of the coral nubbins in the + 7 degrees C treatment experienced tissue
   dissociation, while the remaining nubbins bleached with a 34\% decline
   in stored energy and a decline in respiration and photosynthesis rates
   by 69 and 72\%, respectively. The + 7 degrees C treated coral nubbins
   had 75\% lower carbohydrates compared to nubbins at ambient conditions
   and the lowest carbohydrates to lipid and protein ratio. This study
   demonstrates that exceeding the high bleaching threshold of S.
   pistillata in the Gulf of Aqaba is associated with a catabolic response
   to maintain ATP levels and highlights the energetic cost of thermal
   stress. Understanding anabolic and catabolic processes in corals under
   environmental stress is key to understanding their capacity to survive
   future thermal stress scenarios.},

Abstract = {The increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration, which has resulted from
   the burning of fossil fuels, is being absorbed by the oceans and is
   causing ocean acidification. Ocean acidification involves the decrease
   of both the pH and the calcium carbonate saturation state. Ocean
   acidification is predicted to impact the physiology of marine organisms
   and reduce the calcification rates of corals. In the present study, we
   measured the rates of calcification, respiration, photosynthesis, and
   zooxanthellae density of the tropical coral Acropora digitifera under
   near-natural summertime temperature and sunlight for a 5-week period. We
   found that these key physiological parameters were not affected by both
   mid-CO2 (pCO(2) = 744 +/- A 38, pH = 7.97 +/- A 0.02, Omega(arag) = 2.6
   +/- A 0.1) and high-CO2 conditions (pCO(2) = 2,142 +/- A 205, pH = 7.56
   +/- A 0.04, Omega(arag) = 1.1 +/- A 0.2) throughout the 35 days
   experimental period. Additionally, there was no significant correlation
   between calcification rate and seawater aragonite saturation
   (Omega(arag)). These results suggest that the impacts of ocean
   acidification on corals physiology may be more complex than have been
   previously proposed.},

Abstract = {In 2007 and 2008, multiple sites were identified in the Wakatobi Marine
   National Park, South East Sulawesi, Indonesia, which each represented a
   point along a gradient of light quality, temperature and turbidity. This
   gradient included `optimal', intermediate and marginal sites, where
   conditions were close to the survival threshold limit for corals. Coral
   communities changed across this gradient from diverse, mixed growth form
   assemblages to specialised, massive growth form dominated communities.
   The massive coral Goniastrea aspera was the only species identified at
   the most marginal and optimal sites. Branching species Acropora formosa
   and Porites cylindrica were only identified at optimal sites. The in
   hospite Symbiodinium community also changed across the environmental
   gradient from members of the Symbiodinium clade C on optimal reefs (in
   branching and massive species) to clade D on marginal reefs ( in massive
   species). Substantial variability in respiration and photosynthesis was
   observed in massive coral species under different environmental
   conditions, which suggests that all corals cannot be considered equal
   across environments. Studying present-day marginal environments is
   crucial to further understanding of future reef bio-diversity,
   functioning and accretion, and from work presented here, it is likely
   that as future climate change extends marginal reef range, branching
   coral diversity may decrease relative to massive, more resilient corals.

Title = {Water flow influences the distribution of photosynthetic efficiency
   within colonies of the scleractinian coral Montastrea annualris (Ellis

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2007},

Pages = {10-26},
Month = {NOV 23},
Abstract = {Recent studies have determined that water flow may perform a number of
   roles during and following episodes of coral reef bleaching. Increased
   water flow has the potential to improve the capacity of some
   scleractinian corals to cope with high concentrations of oxygen in the
   boundary layer that are photosynthetically derived, and coral reef
   damage is often at its highest in areas where flow is restricted.
   Conversely, water motion has been shown to increase metabolic rate (both
   photosynthesis and respiration) and such flow-modulated metabolism may
   affect bleaching patterns asymmetrically within a coral colony. To
   broaden these earlier studies and to further examine the effects of flow
   on photosynthetic efficiency, we tested to determine whether or not
   corals would exhibit a spatially asymmetric distribution of
   photosynthetic efficiency related to velocity gradients (degree of
   mixing) across the coral colony. We conducted experiments from the NOAA
   underwater habitat Aquarius on colonies of Montastrea annularis (Ellis
   and Solander, 1786) with controlled exposures to increased flow (ca. 40
   cm s(-1), 1 cm above coral surface) and temperature (ca. 2 degrees C
   above ambient) using in situ flow chambers. We measured photosynthetic
   efficiency as a light-adapted quantum yield (F-v'/F-m') using Pulse
   Amplitude Modulation (PAM) fluorometry to examine the short-term (daily)
   and medium term (>= 9 days) response of patches of polyps within coral
   colonies. M annularis colonies developed and sustained a significant
   spatially asymmetric pattern of photosynthetic yield across the entire
   coral surface, with the upstream side of the colonies exhibiting reduced
   quantum yield. The mechanism producing this pattern is unclear; we
   speculate that increased flow may lead to increased photosynthesis by
   upstream polyps through bicarbonate delivery accentuated by the Q(10)
   effect. Local down-regulation of the photosynthetic response (decreased
   quantum yield) might then occur to keep tissue oxygen concentrations
   within tolerable limits. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The effect of warming and benthic community acclimation on coral reef
   carbonate sediment metabolism and dissolution},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {149-163},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Global warming (and the consequent increase in sea surface temperature)
   is expected to modify rates of gross primary production (GPP),
   respiration (R), and net calcium carbonate (CaCO3) dissolution in
   permeable coral reef carbonate sediments. Previous simulations of
   seawater warming on coral reef sediments found a decline in the GPP/R
   ratio and an associated increase in CaCO3 dissolution but were only
   conducted over a short timescale (<24h). To date, no studies have
   examined the prolonged (>24h) effect of seawater warming on coral reef
   CaCO3 sediment metabolism and dissolution, which may allow the benthic
   community to acclimatise. This study used 600-L flume aquaria to examine
   the effect of seawater warming on GPP, R, and CaCO3 dissolution in the
   permeable coral reef CaCO3 sediments of Mo'orea, French Polynesia, over
   a period of 15d. On average, when exposed to warmed seawater (+2.8
   degrees C), R in the CaCO3 sediments was enhanced (+58\%) to a greater
   extent than GPP (+19\%), resulting in a decline in GPP/R (-23\%) and an
   associated increase in net CaCO3 dissolution (+126\%). The magnitude of
   these warming-mediated metabolic changes increased each day until
   reaching a plateau after about 8d, indicating that 24-h experiments may
   be underestimating the effect of warming over longer timescales.
   Interestingly, the increase in dissolution relative to control
   treatments was more striking during the day (+163\%) than at night
   (+89\%), suggesting that warming acted to both enhance geochemical
   dissolution and reduce biogenic calcification or inorganic
   precipitation. Together, these data indicate that, over the timescale
   observed here, photosynthesis and associated inorganic and biogenic
   CaCO3 precipitation do not exhibit the ability to counterbalance the
   warming-mediated increase in sediment heterotrophy and CaCO3
   dissolution.},

Abstract = {Single polyps of Galaxea fascicularis were fixed to glass. vials with
   underwater epoxy resin. After regeneration into microcolonies they were
   used for microsensor measurements of photosynthesis and calcification
   under different incubating temperatures. Gross photosynthesis was found
   highest at temperatures of 23 and 26 degrees C (ca. 0.022 mole O-2 m(-3)
   s(-1)), close to the ambient temperature (i.e. 26 degrees C). At 35
   degrees C, gross photosynthesis was irreversibly inhibited as the
   microcolonies bleached. The net photosynthesis rapidly decreased with
   temperature and became negative at temperatures higher than 29 degrees
   C. Profiles of O-2 and Ca2+ showed a strong effect of temperature on
   them. The concentrations of Ca2+ measured on the polyp surface also
   showed temperature dependence of Call uptake. In the dark and below 29
   degrees C, the surface Ca2+ concentration was temperature independent.
   During illumination, the surface Ca2+ concentration showed a dip at 26
   degrees C (ca. 8.7 MM), indicating maximum uptake rates at ambient
   temperature. However, at 32 degrees C and higher, Ca2+ was slightly
   higher at the tissue surface than in the seawater, in both light and
   dark, resulting from calcium dissolution. The surface pH in light
   increased gradually from 8.3 to 8.6 with increasing temperature to 23
   degrees C, and thereafter remained constant to 29 degrees C. At 32
   degrees C, the pH became slightly acidic compared with the water phase,
   probably due to a decrease in the uptake of CO2 by photosynthesis. The
   largest difference in pH between light and dark incubations was at
   temperatures between 23 and 29 degrees C (7.5-7.7 in dark versus 8.6-8.7
   in light), which indicate high rates of photosynthesis and respiration
   in this temperature range. It is concluded that photosynthetic activity
   in the coral is maintained up to rather high temperatures (32 degrees
   C), but corals at super-optimum temperatures (above 26 degrees C)
   consume more O-2 than they produce, decalcify and produce CO2.},

Abstract = {In order for sessile organisms to survive environmental fluctuations and
   exposures to pollutants, molecular mechanisms (i.e. stress responses)
   are elicited. Previously, detrimental effects of natural and
   anthropogenic stressors on coral health could not be ascertained until
   significant physiological responses resulted in visible signs of stress
   (e.g. tissue necrosis, bleaching). In this study, a focused. anthozoan
   holobiont microarray was used to detect early and sub-lethal effects of
   spatial and temporal environmental changes on gene expression patterns
   in the scleractinian coral, Montastraea cavernosa, on south Florida
   reefs. Although all colonies appeared healthy (i.e. no visible tissue
   necrosis or bleaching), corals were differentially physiologically
   compensating for exposure to stressors that varied over time. Corals
   near the Port of Miami inlet experienced significant changes in
   expression of stress responsive and symbiont (zooxanthella)-specific
   genes after periods of heavy precipitation. In contrast, coral
   populations did not demonstrate stress responses during periods of
   increased water temperature (up to 29 degrees C). Specific acute and
   long-term localized responses to other stressors were also evident. A
   correlation between stress response genes and symbiont-specific genes
   was also observed, possibly indicating early processes involved in the
   maintenance or disruption of the coral zooxanthella symbiosis. This is
   the first study to reveal spatially- and temporally-related variation in
   gene expression in response to different stressors of in situ coral
   populations, and demonstrates that microarray technology can be used to
   detect specific sub-lethal physiological responses to specific
   environmental conditions that are not visually detectable. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{[}1] The effect of elevated pCO(2) on the metabolism of a coral reef
   community dominated by macroalgae has been investigated utilizing the
   large 2650 m 3 coral reef mesocosm at the Biosphere-2 facility near
   Tucson, Arizona. The carbonate chemistry of the water was manipulated to
   simulate present-day and a doubled CO2 future condition. Each experiment
   consisted of a 1-2 month preconditioning period followed by a 7-9 day
   observational period. The pCO(2) was 404 +/- 63 muatm during the
   present-day pCO(2) experiment and 658 +/- 59 matm during the elevated
   pCO(2) experiment. Nutrient levels were low and typical of natural reefs
   waters (NO3- 0.5-0.9 muM, NH4+ 0.4 muM, PO43- 0.07-0.09 muM). The
   temperature and salinity of the water were held constant at 26.5 +/-
   0.2degreesC and 34.4 +/- 0.2 ppt. Photosynthetically available
   irradiance was 10 +/- 2 during the present-day experiment and 7.4 +/-
   0.5 mol photons m(-2) d(-1) during the elevated pCO(2) experiment. The
   primary producer biomass in the mesocosm was dominated by four species
   of macroalgae; Haptilon cubense, Amphiroa fragillisima, Gelidiopsis
   intricata and Chondria dasyphylla. Algal biomass was 10.4 mol C m(-2)
   during the present-day and 8.7 mol C m(-2) and during the elevated
   pCO(2) experiments. As previously observed, the increase in pCO(2)
   resulted in a decrease in calcification from 0.041 +/- 0.007 to 0.006
   +/- 0.003 mol CaCO3 m(-2) d(-1). Net community production (NCP) and dark
   respiration did not change in response to elevated pCO(2). Light
   respiration measured by a new radiocarbon isotope dilution method
   exceeded dark respiration by a factor of 1.2 +/- 0.3 to 2.1 +/- 0.4 on a
   daily basis and by 2.2 +/- 0.6 to 3.9 +/- 0.8 on an hourly basis. The
   1.8-fold increase with increasing pCO(2) indicates that the enhanced
   respiration in the light was not due to photorespiration. Gross
   production (GPP) computed as the sum of NCP plus daily respiration
   (light + dark) increased significantly (0.24 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.32 +/- 0.04
   mol C m(-2) d(-1)). However, the conventional calculation of GPP based
   on the assumption that respiration in the light proceeds at the same
   rate as the dark underestimated the true rate of GPP by 41-100\% and
   completely missed the increased rate of carbon cycling due to elevated
   pCO(2). We conclude that under natural, undisturbed, nutrient-limited
   conditions elevated CO2 depresses calcification, stimulates the rate of
   turnover of organic carbon, particularly in the light, but has no effect
   on net organic production. The hypothesis that an increase pCO(2) would
   produce an increase in net production that would counterbalance the
   effect of decreasing saturation state on calcification is not supported
   by these data.},

Abstract = {Coral calcification is affected by the decrease in aragonite saturation
   state ((arag)) caused by ocean acidification (OA). However, OA effects
   are modulated by other environmental factors such as seawater
   temperature, light intensity and nutrients. Considering that in
   subtropical coral reefs all these factors vary seasonally, it can be
   hypothesized that the magnitude of OA effects on coral physiology will
   also vary seasonally. We evaluated the seasonal coral calcification rate
   of a subtropical reef-building coral under OA conditions. We approached
   this aim by culturing Acropora digitifera under three different CO2
   partial pressure (pCO(2)) conditions in three different seasons (summer,
   autumn and winter) under natural light and temperature conditions.
   Additionally, to predict future coral net G, the year-round seawater
   carbonate chemistry was measured on the coast of Okinawa Island, and the
   annual coral CaCO3 production amount assessed considering seasonal
   changes in environmental conditions. Coral A. digitifera net
   calcification (net G) significantly differed among seasons, and summer
   net G was 1.7 and 2.7 times higher than autumn and winter, respectively.
   However, the impact of OA did not differ among seasons and the rate of
   net G decrease per unit (arag) was 11.1\%, 17.4\% and 18.7\% for summer,
   autumn and winter, respectively. The regression model indicated that net
   G of A. digitifera is primarily affected by temperature, secondly by
   seawater (arag,) while light intensity was not selected as an
   explanatory factor, and there was no interactive effect among the
   factors. The model predicts that the present annual A. digitifera net G
   in Okinawa Island reef (present mean annual pCO(2): 382atm and (arag):
   3.49) is about 0.3g CaCO(3)cm(-2)y(-1), and it will decrease by 20\%
   with an increase of 500atm seawater pCO(2) than the present condition.
   As reefs in high-latitude regions already have marginal positive net G,
   further decrease in annual CaCO3 production would be detrimental for the
   reef under conditions of climate change.},

Abstract = {The Biosphere 2 coral reef biome is a large tank of living coral reef
   organisms (water volume of 2650 m(3), water surface area of 711 m(2) and
   590 m(2) of reef benthos). The water of the biome is characteristically
   very low in dissolved nutrients and phytoplankton. The present community
   of organisms is largely comprised of macroalgae, including 11 genera of
   green algae, eight genera of red algae, two genera of brown algae, and
   some blue-green algae. There are 25 genera of coral and two genera of
   sponges, but they do not dominate the benthos. Fish comprise 16 genera,
   with seven genera of echinoids and three genera of crustaceans. The
   coral reef biome water is presently monitored continuously for
   temperature, salinity, light, O-2, and pCO(2), and monitored daily to
   weekly for alkalinity, Sigma CO2, pH, nutrients and delta(13)C(DIC) and
   delta(18)O(water) values. There are a number of filtration devices,
   pumps and aerators which have been used in the past to manipulate water
   movement and composition, but at present the community has come to
   steady-state without this machinery. Did changes in O-2 and CO2 allow
   measurements of community metabolism under different experimental
   conditions of water chemistry, water motion, seasonal light changes, and
   temperature. Typical values for community metabolic parameters under
   steady state conditions are: gross production (P), similar to 290 mmol C
   m(-2) d(-1), respiration (R), similar to 270 mmol C m(-2) d(-1), P/R,
   similar to 1.1 and community calcification, similar to 23 mmol CaCO3
   m(-2) d(-1), or only 8\% of gross production. Calcification rate has
   been altered, 0-140 mmol CaCO3 m(-2) d(-1,) and is positively correlated
   to-saturation state or CO3-2 concentration. The community metabolism
   values are about half of a natural tropical algal/coral reef flat, but
   typical of high latitude, shallow, coral reef lagoonal environments.
   Even though there are some peculiar characteristics of the Biosphere
   coral reef, the coral reef biome functions as a recognizable coral reef
   community. The Biosphere 2 coral reef system offers an excellent
   opportunity to test questions of how environmental factors influence
   processes at community and organismal scares. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Title = {Antagonistic Effects of Ocean Acidification and Rising Sea Surface
   Temperature on the Dissolution of Coral Reef Carbonate Sediments},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {Increasing atmospheric CO2 is raising sea surface temperature (SST) and
   increasing seawater CO2 concentrations, resulting in a lower oceanic pH
   (ocean acidification; OA), which is expected to reduce the accretion of
   coral reef ecosystems. Although sediments comprise most of the calcium
   carbonate (CaCO3) within coral reefs, no in situ studies have looked at
   the combined effects of increased SST and OA on the dissolution of coral
   reef CaCO3 sediments. In situ benthic chamber incubations were used to
   measure dissolution rates in permeable CaCO3 sands under future OA and
   SST scenarios in a coral reef lagoon on Australia's Great Barrier Reef
   (Heron Island). End of century (2100) simulations (temperature +2.7
   degrees C and pH -0.3) shifted carbonate sediments from net
   precipitating to net dissolving. Warming increased the rate of benthic
   respiration (R) by 29\% per 1 degrees C and lowered the ratio of
   productivity to respiration (P/R; Delta P/R = -0.23), which increased
   the rate of CaCO3 sediment dissolution (average net increase of 18.9
   mmol CaCO3 m(-2) d(-1) for business as usual scenarios). This is most
   likely due to the influence of warming on benthic P/R which, in turn,
   was an important control on sediment dissolution through the respiratory
   production of rho CO2. The effect of increasing CO2 on CaCO3 sediment
   dissolution (average net increase of 6.5 mmol CaCO3 m(-2) d(-1) for
   business as usual scenarios) was significantly less than the effect of
   warming. However, the combined effect of increasing both SST and rho CO2
   on CaCO3 sediment dissolution was non-additive (average net increase of
   5.6 mmol CaCO3 m(-2) d(-1)) due to the different responses of the
   benthic community. This study highlights that benthic biogeochemical
   processes, such as metabolism and associated CaCO3 sediment dissolution
   respond rapidly to changes in SST and OA, and that the response to
   multiple environmental changes are not necessarily additive.},

Abstract = {Stressors arising from human activities may interact not only with each
   other, but also with natural disturbances. However, experimental studies
   on disturbance complexity and physiological responses of corals to
   sublethal stresses, especially those due to human activities, are
   surprisingly few. In this study we investigated the stress response of
   the scleractinian coral Porites cylindrica after 24 h of exposure to
   copper (11 mug Cu 1(-1)) and increased temperature (following a 4
   degreesC above-ambient curve), separately and in combination. We also
   investigated the effect of sequential stress where corals pre-exposed to
   increased temperature for 24 h were exposed to copper (for 24 h) after a
   5-day recovery period. Changes in gross primary production (Pg: per
   milligram chlorophyll a per hour) and respiration (R:per square
   centimeter per hour) in terms of dissolved oxygen were used as
   indicators of stress. The results show that heat and the combination of
   heat and copper significantly reduced production rate. However, corals
   er,posed to elevated temperature displayed a significantly higher
   production rate following the 5-day recovery period. The combination of
   the two stressors showed no additive or synergistic effects. Copper
   alone had no effect on the production rate. However, corals that were
   pre-exposed to increased temperature and again exposed to copper after 5
   days displayed a significant reduction in production rate. The
   respiration rate was significantly reduced by all treatments, although
   no significant differences between treatments were detected. The results
   presented here illustrate how a stressor that does not affect corals
   when acting in isolation may do so in sequential combination with other
   stressors.},

Abstract = {Two inhibitors of the Calvin-Benson cycle {[}glycolaldehyde (GA) and
   potassium cyanide (KCN)] were used in cultured Symbiodinium cells and in
   nubbins of the coral Pocillopora damicornis to test the hypothesis that
   inhibition of the Calvin-Benson cycle triggers coral bleaching.
   Inhibitor concentration range-finding trials aimed to determine the
   appropriate concentration to generate inhibition of the Calvin-Benson
   cycle, but avoid other metabolic impacts to the symbiont and the animal
   host. Both 3 mmol l(-1) GA and 20 mol l(-1) KCN caused minimal
   inhibition of host respiration, but did induce photosynthetic
   impairment, measured by a loss of photosystem II function and oxygen
   production. GA did not affect the severity of bleaching, nor induce
   bleaching in the absence of thermal stress, suggesting inhibition of the
   Calvin-Benson cycle by GA does not initiate bleaching in P. damicornis.
   In contrast, KCN did activate a bleaching response through symbiont
   expulsion, which occurred in the presence and absence of thermal stress.
   While KCN is an inhibitor of the Calvin-Benson cycle, it also promotes
   reactive oxygen species formation, and it is likely that this was the
   principal agent in the coral bleaching process. These findings do not
   support the hypothesis that temperature-induced inhibition of the
   Calvin-Benson cycle alone induces coral bleaching.},

Title = {Effects of episodic low aragonite saturation and elevated temperature on
   the physiology of Stylophora pistillata},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {99},
Pages = {26-33},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {As global climate change is predicted to gradually alter the oceans'
   carbonate system and water temperature, knowledge about the effects an
   altered marine environment has on the physiology of reef building
   (hermatypic) coral species is more widely established. However, although
   it is recognized that seawater temperature and the carbonate system of a
   coral reef can change rapidly and with great amplitude, little is known
   about how the interaction of these natural fluctuations with long term
   effects of climate change may affect the metabolism and productivity of
   hermatypic corals. To investigate this, we acclimated the hermatypic
   coral Stylophora pistillata to a ``worst case{''} scenario for carbon
   dioxide emissions (aragonite saturation state {[}Omega(ARAG)] = 1.6),
   and tested how exposure to short term (24 h) elevated temperature (+3
   degrees C) and further lowered Omega(ARAG) (-1 unit) affected its
   photosynthesis and respiration. While episodic exposure to very low
   Omega(ARAG) had only little effect on S. pistillata's physiology, short
   term heat stress caused a shift from net oxygen production to
   consumption and partial coral bleaching. Higher gross coral respiration,
   and lowered photosynthetic activity under episodically elevated
   temperature may have been the result of photoinhibition and partial
   coral bleaching. These findings suggest that fluctuating environmental
   conditions in combination with a low Omega(ARAG) background signal may
   impair basic metabolic processes in calcifying corals. In a future
   high-CO2 world short term stress could be relevant for reef ecosystem
   processes, and may affect the resilience of coral reefs to other
   external influences and effects of climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {The effect of feeding on the carbon isotopic composition of
   zooxanthellae, animal tissue and skeleton was investigated in the
   scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata. Two sets of corals were grown
   with filtered seawater under controlled conditions. One group of
   colonies was fed Artemia sp. nauplii and compared to a control group
   that was starved. Fed corals exhibited higher concentrations of
   chlorophyll (60\% more), soluble protein (4 times more) and
   calcification rates (29\% more) than starved colonies. The net
   photosynthetic rate was higher in starved than in fed corals (18.53 +/-
   6.99 and 6.78 +/- 2.06 mumol O-2 cm(-2) h(-1) respectively), whereas
   dark respiration was not significantly different (8.74 +/- 2.27 and 6.66
   +/- 0.40 mumol O-2 cm(-2) h(-1)). The average delta(13)C value of
   Artemia sp. nauplii used for feeding was -12parts per thousand.
   delta(13)C was significantly heavier in zooxanthellae than in animal
   tissues, for both fed (-10.1 vs -11.7parts per thousand) and starved
   colonies (-10.9 vs -13.2parts per thousand.). Artemia sp. carbon was
   incorporated into the coral tissue as shown by the heavier delta(13)C in
   fed than in starved colonies (- 11.7 to -13.2parts per thousand,
   respectively), although there was no difference in the delta(13)C of the
   zooxanthellae fraction. Skeletal delta(13)C was similar in fed and
   starved colonies (mean -4.6parts per thousand). Skeletal delta(18)O
   composition was, however, significantly different between the 2
   treatments (-4.24 to -4.05parts per thousand. for fed and starved
   colonies, respectively), which may have been due to differences in the
   calcification rates of fed and starved corals. These data are used to
   establish a conceptual model of the carbon flow between the various
   compartments of a symbiotic coral. It suggests that the skeletal
   delta(13)C is not sensitive to heterotrophic food supply.},

Abstract = {Reef-building corals throughout the world are considered endangered. The
   evidence is a decline in coral health and reduced coral cover. Competing

   that corals of the Florida reefs are functioning close to the

Abstract = {Coral reefs are suffering unprecedented declines worldwide. Most studies
   focus on stressors such as rising temperatures, nutrient pollution,
   overfishing, and ocean acidification as drivers of this degradation.
   However, recent mass mortality events associated with low oxygen on
   coral reefs indicate that oxygen is a critical factor that can be
   limiting in reef environments. Here, we present evidence that integrates
   across disciplines and perspectives to reveal how natural and
   anthropogenic factors drive variation in oxygen at multiple scales on
   coral reefs. This variation, in turn, limits essential processes such as
   productivity, respiration, and calcification on reefs and often plays a
   role in the outcome of interactions between corals and their
   competitors, pathogens, and mutualists. Moreover, the apparent effects
   of temperature, eutrophication, acidification, and other stressors on
   corals are commonly mediated by oxygen. As a consequence, the imprint of
   oxygen variation is evident in many patterns including reef
   biodiversity, coral bleaching, colony morphology, and fish behavior. We
   suggest that the structure and dynamics of coral reefs can be fully
   understood only by considering the ubiquitous role of oxygen, and we
   identify critical areas of future oxygen research to guide the study and
   management of coral reefs in a changing world.},

Journal = {ECOLOGY},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Shifts from coral to algal dominance are expected to increase in
   tropical coral reefs as a result of anthropogenic disturbances. The
   consequences for key ecosystem functions such as primary productivity,
   calcification, and nutrient recycling are poorly understood,
   particularly under changing environmental conditions. We used a novel in
   situ incubation approach to compare functions of coral- and
   algae-dominated communities in the central Red Sea bimonthly over an
   entire year. In situ gross and net community primary productivity,
   calcification, dissolved organic carbon fluxes, dissolved inorganic
   nitrogen fluxes, and their respective activation energies were
   quantified to describe the effects of seasonal changes. Overall,
   coral-dominated communities exhibited 30\% lower net productivity and 10
   times higher calcification than algae-dominated communities. Estimated
   activation energies indicated a higher thermal sensitivity of
   coral-dominated communities. In these communities, net productivity and
   calcification were negatively correlated with temperature (>40\% and
   >65\% reduction, respectively, with +5 degrees C increase from winter to
   summer), whereas carbon losses via respiration and dissolved organic
   carbon release more than doubled at higher temperatures. In contrast,
   algae-dominated communities doubled net productivity in summer, while
   calcification and dissolved organic carbon fluxes were unaffected. These
   results suggest pronounced changes in community functioning associated
   with coral-algal phase shifts. Algae-dominated communities may
   outcompete coral-dominated communities because of their higher
   productivity and carbon retention to support fast biomass accumulation
   while compromising the formation of important reef framework structures.
   Higher temperatures likely amplify these functional differences,
   indicating a high vulnerability of ecosystem functions of
   coral-dominated communities to temperatures even below coral bleaching
   thresholds. Our results suggest that ocean warming may not only cause
   but also amplify coral-algal phase shifts in coral reefs.},

Abstract = {Dinitrogen (N-2) fixation by specialized prokaryotes (diazotrophs)
   represents an important source of bioavailable nitrogen (N) in the
   ocean. In coral reefs, several substrates and organisms are associated
   with diazotrophs, but potential N-2 fixation activity by zooxanthellate
   soft corals has not yet been investigated. Such soft corals may
   contribute importantly to the input of new N into the reef ecosystem, as
   they can cover substantial benthic areas in today's coral reefs.
   Therefore, this study investigated N-2 fixation of 2 dominant
   zooxanthellate soft coral groups (Sarcophyton sp. and Xeniidae) in a
   northern Red Sea fringing reef during all 4 seasons of 1 yr. This was
   supplemented by respirometry incubations and in situ monitoring of key
   environmental parameters. Findings revealed detectable N-2 fixation for
   both soft corals during all seasons. Annual N-2 fixation by Sarcophyton
   sp. was 3 times higher than that by Xeniidae, but both soft corals
   exhibited similar seasonal patterns. N-2 fixation significantly
   increased during summer, when water temperature and light intensity were
   highest and inorganic nutrient availability was lowest. Coral
   respiration also peaked during summer and was positively correlated to
   N-2 fixation, while photosynthesis revealed maximum rates during the
   nutrient-enriched spring season. Given the importance of N for
   reproduction and growth, N-2 fixation may be a key component of soft
   coral nutrition during summer, when inorganic nutrient availability in
   the water column is lowest and likely not sufficient to sustain the high
   metabolic demand of soft corals.},

Title = {Effects of exposure duration on the response of Pocillopora damicornis

Abstract = {Efforts to evaluate the response of coral larvae to global climate
   change (GCC) and ocean acidification (OA) typically employ short
   experiments of fixed length, yet it is unknown how the response is
   affected by exposure duration. In this study, we exposed larvae from the
   brooding coral Pocillopora damicornis to contrasts of temperature (24.00
   degrees C {[}ambient] versus 30.49 degrees C) and pCO(2) (49.4 Pa versus
   862 Pa) for varying periods (1-5 days) to test the hypothesis that
   exposure duration had no effect on larval response as assessed by
   protein content, respiration, Symbiodinium density, and survivorship;
   exposure times were ecologically relevant compared to representative
   pelagic larval durations (PLO) for corals. Larvae differed among days
   for all response variables, and the effects of the treatment were
   relatively consistent regardless of exposure duration for three of the
   four response variables. Protein content and Symbiodinium density were
   unaffected by temperature and pCO(2), but respiration increased with
   temperature (but not pCO(2)) with the effect intensifying as incubations
   lengthened. Survival, however, differed significantly among treatments
   at the end of the study, and by the 5th day, 78\% of the larvae were
   alive and swimming under ambient temperature and ambient pCO(2), but
   only 55-59\% were alive in the other treatments. These results
   demonstrate that the physiological effects of temperature and pCO(2) on
   coral larvae can reliably be detected within days, but effects on
   survival require days to detect. The detection of time-dependent effects
   on larval survivorship suggests that the influence of GCC and OA will be
   stronger for corals having long PLDs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   of Coral Metabolic Health and Rates of Calcification},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {NOV 12},
Abstract = {Underwater visual monitoring methods are used broadly to evaluate coral
   reef conditions in the natural environment, but quantitative
   measurements of the coral holobiont has been largely restricted to
   photophysiological assessment of the endosymbionts. An underwater
   respirometer has been designed to make routine, diver-operated,
   non-invasive measurements at coral surfaces, but the realistic in situ
   accuracy and precision capabilities of this device has not been
   critically assessed; an essential step if these measurements are to be
   useful for quantifying spatial and seasonal patterns of coral
   metabolism. We developed specific protocols for this system to survey
   shallow coral colonies and detect metabolic profiles (respiration,
   photosynthesis, and biocalcification), diel cycles (day and night), and
   photosynthesis-irradiance curves. Analysis of data from in situ and
   laboratory-controlled conditions showed good replication among coral
   colonies and high precision measurements of temperature, oxygen and pH
   fluxes over 15-min incubation times without noticeable detrimental
   effects on coral health. Moreover, marked differences were observed in
   coral calcification rates between estuarine-influenced and coastal
   marine conditions, despite the absence of significant differences in
   visual appearance or other health indicators, revealing the system's
   potential for early detection of marginally adverse conditions for coral
   metabolism. Its ease of operation and rapid quantification of the
   physiological status of the corals make this respirometer well suited
   for use by reef scientists, monitoring agencies, and stakeholders in
   biogenic reefs conservation efforts. Moreover, the high spatial and
   temporal resolution of these underwater respirometer data will have the
   potential to discriminate the effects of local stressors on coral health
   from those generated by broader changes associated with climate drivers.},

Title = {Complex and interactive effects of ocean acidification and temperature
   on epilithic and endolithic coral-reef turf algal assemblages},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1059-1070},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Turf algal assemblages are ubiquitous primary producers on coral reefs,
   but little is known about the response of this diverse group to ocean
   acidification (OA) across different temperatures. We tested the
   hypothesis that CO2 influences the functional response of epilithic and
   endolithic turf assemblages to increasing temperature. Replicate
   carbonate plugs covered by turf were collected from the reef and exposed
   to ambient and high pCO(2) (1000 A mu atm) conditions for 3 weeks. Each
   pCO(2) treatment was replicated across six temperatures (24.0-31.5 A
   degrees C) that spanned the full seasonal temperature range on a
   fringing reef in Moorea, French Polynesia, and included one warming
   treatment (3 A degrees C above daily average temperatures). Temperature
   and CO2 enrichment had complex, and sometimes interactive, effects on
   turf metabolism and growth. Photosynthetic and respiration rates were
   enhanced by increasing temperature, with an interactive effect of CO2
   enrichment. Photosynthetic rates were amplified by high CO2 in the
   warmest temperatures, while the increase in respiration rates with
   temperature were enhanced under ambient CO2. Epilithic turf growth rates
   were not affected by temperature, but increased in response to CO2
   enrichment. We found that CO2 and temperature interactively affected the
   endolithic assemblage, with the highest growth rates under CO2
   enrichment, but only at the warmest temperatures. These results
   demonstrate how OA may influence algal physiology and growth across a
   range of ecologically relevant temperatures, and indicate that the
   effects of CO2 enrichment on coral-reef turf assemblages can be
   temperature dependent. The complex effects of CO2 enrichment and
   temperature across a suite of algal responses illustrates the importance
   of incorporating multiple stressors into global change experiments.},

   Coral Holobiont},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Month = {FEB 13},
Abstract = {The nutritional symbiosis between coral hosts and photosynthetic
   dinoflagellates is fundamental to the functioning of coral reefs. Rising
   seawater temperatures destabilize this relationship, resulting in
   drastic declines in world-wide coral cover. Thermal history is thought
   to play an important role in shaping a coral's response to subsequent
   thermal stress. Here, we exposed Pocillopora damicomis to two thermal
   acclimation regimes (ambient vs. warm) and compared the effect that
   acclimation had on the coral holobiont's response to a subsequent seven
   day heat stress event. We conducted daily physiological measurements at
   the holobiont level (gross photosynthesis, respiration, host protein
   content, symbiont density and chlorophyll content) throughout the
   heating event, as well as cellular-level imaging of C-13-bicarbonate and
   N-15-nitrate assimilation (using NanoSIMS) at the end of the heat stress
   event. Thermal acclimation history had a negligible effect on the
   measurements conducted at the holobiont level during the heat stress
   event. No differences were observed in the O-2-budget between ambient
   and warm-acclimated corals and only small fluctuations in host protein,
   symbiont density and chlorophyll content were detected. In contrast,
   this lack of differential response, was not mirrored at the cellular
   level. Warm-acclimated corals had substantially higher C-13 enrichment
   in the host gastrodermis and lipid bodies, but significantly lower
   N-15-nitrate assimilation in the symbionts and the host tissue layers,
   relative to the ambient-acclimated corals. We discuss potential reasons
   for the disconnect that occurred between symbiont bicarbonate and
   nitrate assimilation (in the absence of photosynthetic breakdown) in the
   warm-acclimated corals. We suggest this represents either a shift in
   nitrogen utilization, or supply limitation by the host. Our findings
   raise several interesting hypotheses regarding the role that nitrogen
   metabolism plays in thermal stress, which will warrant further
   investigation if we are to understand the acclimatization capacity of
   the coral holobiont.},

Title = {Nutrient and sediment loading affect multiple facets of functionality in
   a tropical branching coral},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {223},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Coral reefs, one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world, face
   increasing pressures from global and local anthropogenic stressors.
   Therefore, a better understanding of the ecological ramifications of
   warming and land-based inputs (e.g. sedimentation and nutrient loading)
   on coral reef ecosystems is necessary. In this study, we measured how a
   natural nutrient and sedimentation gradient affected multiple facets of
   coral functionality, including endosymbiont and coral host response
   variables, holobiont metabolic responses and percent cover of
   Pocillopora acuta colonies in Mo'orea, French Polynesia. We used thermal
   performance curves to quantify the relationship between metabolic rates
   and temperature along the environmental gradient. We found that algal
   endosymbiont percent nitrogen content, endosymbiont densities and total
   chlorophyll a content increased with nutrient input, while endosymbiont
   nitrogen content per cell decreased, likely representing competition
   among the algal endosymbionts. Nutrient and sediment loading decreased
   coral metabolic responses to thermal stress in terms of their thermal
   performance and metabolic rate processes. The acute thermal optimum for
   dark respiration decreased, along with the maximal performance for gross
   photosynthetic and calcification rates. Gross photosynthetic and
   calcification rates normalized to a reference temperature (26.8 degrees
   C) decreased along the gradient. Lastly, percent cover of P. acuta
   colonies decreased by nearly two orders of magnitude along the nutrient
   gradient. These findings illustrate that nutrient and sediment loading
   affect multiple levels of coral functionality. Understanding how
   local-scale anthropogenic stressors influence the responses of corals to
   temperature can inform coral reef management, particularly in relation
   to the mediation of land-based inputs into coastal coral reef
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {This study presents a novel approach resulting in the first cold-water
   coral reef biomass maps, used to assess associated ecosystem functions,
   such as carbon (C) stock and turnover. We focussed on two dominant
   ecosystem engineers at the Mingulay Reef Complex, the coral Lophelia
   pertusa (rubble, live and dead framework) and the sponge Spongosorites
   coralliophaga. Firstly, from combining biological (high-definition
   video, collected specimens), environmental (extracted from multibeam
   bathymetry) and ecosystem function (oxygen consumption rate values)
   data, we calculated biomass, C stock and turnover which can feed into
   assessments of C budgets. Secondly, using those values, we employed
   random forest modelling to predictively map whole-reef live coral and
   sponge biomass. The whole-reef mean biomass of S. coralliophaga was
   estimated to be 304 T (range 168-440 T biomass), containing 10 T C
   (range 5-18 T C) stock. The mean skeletal mass of the coral colonies
   (live and dead framework) was estimated to be 3874 T (range 507-9352 T
   skeletal mass), containing a mean of 209 T of biomass (range 26-515 T
   biomass) and a mean of 465 T C (range 60-1122 T C) stock. These
   estimates were used to calculate the C turnover rates, using respiration
   data available in the literature. These calculations revealed that the
   epi- and microbial fauna associated with coral rubble were the largest
   contributor towards C turnover in the area with a mean of 163 T C
   year(-1) (range 149-176 T C year(-1)). The live and dead framework of L.
   pertusa were estimated to overturn a mean of 32 T C year(-1) (range 4-93
   T C year(-1)) and 44 T C year(-1) (range 6-139 T C year(-1)),
   respectively. Our calculations showed that the Mingulay Reef overturned
   three to seven (with a mean of four) times more C than a soft-sediment
   area at a similar depth. As proof of concept, the supply of C needed
   from surface water primary productivity to the reef was inferred. Since
   65-124 T C year(-1) is supplied by natural deposition and our study
   suggested that a mean of 241 T C year(-1) (range 160-400 T C year(-1)),
   was turned over by the reef, a mean of 117-176 T C year(-1) (range
   36-335 T C year(-1)) of the reef would therefore be supplied by tidal
   downwelling and/or deep-water advection. Our results indicate that
   monitoring and/or managing surface primary productivity would be a key
   consideration for any efforts towards the conservation of cold-water
   coral reef ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium, the endosymbiont of reef
   corals, play an important role in coral-bleaching events which can be
   induced by prolonged enhanced seawater temperature anomalies, and which
   are predicted to occur at increasing frequencies and severities due to
   global warming. The genus Symbiodinium exhibits high genetic diversity
   with physiological variation within and among species, leading to a
   range of thermal tolerance. Although these variations have been examined
   in individual species, comprehensive comparative experimental data
   across several species are still rare. Therefore, in the present study,
   the photophysiological and thermal response patterns of six genetically
   characterized Symbiodinium genotypes were comparatively investigated.
   The six Symbiodinium genotypes were isolated from four different host
   species from the following biogeographic locations: Hawaii (Central
   Pacific), Panama (Caribbean), Florida (Caribbean), and Palau (West
   Pacific). Photosynthesis-irradiance curve and growth measurements at
   temperatures ranging from 20 to 33 A degrees C were carried out. All
   physiological data clearly indicate significant differences in the
   response patterns of the six Symbiodinium genotypes. While some types
   photosynthesized, respired, and grew at 33 A degrees C, others showed a
   partial or complete inhibition. The genotype-specific response over the
   experimental temperature reveals the potential range response of a given
   symbiont and variation between strains that adaptation might act upon.},

Abstract = {Tropical reef corals are well known for their sensitivity to rising
   temperature, yet surprisingly little is known of the mechanisms through
   which temperature acts on intact coral colonies. One such mechanism
   recently has been suggested by the association between the growth of
   juvenile corals and seawater temperature in the Caribbean, which
   suggests that temperature causes a transition between isometric and
   allometric growth scaling in warmer versus cooler years, respectively
   (Edmunds in Proc R Soc B 273:2275-2281, 2006). Here, this correlative
   association is tested experimentally for a cause-and-effect
   relationship. During April and May 2006, juvenile colonies (8-35 mm
   diameter) of massive Porites spp. from Moorea, French Polynesia, were
   incubated at warm (27.8 degrees C) and cool (25.7 degrees C)
   temperatures for 15 days, and their response assessed through the
   scaling of growth (change in weight) with colony size. The results
   reveal that the scaling of colony-specific growth (mg colony(-1)
   day(-1)) was unaffected by temperature, although growth absolutely was
   greater at the cool compared to the warm temperature, regardless of
   colony size. This outcome was caused by contrasting scaling
   relationships for area-specific growth (mg cm(-2) day(-1)) that were
   negatively allometric under warm conditions, but independent of size
   under cool conditions. In April 2007, a 22 days field experiment
   confirmed that the scaling of area-specific growth in juvenile Porites
   spp. is negatively allometric at a warm temperature of 29.5 degrees C.
   Based on strong allometry for tissue thickness, biomass, and
   Symbiodinium density in freshly collected Porites spp., it is
   hypothesized that the temperature-dependency of growth scaling in these
   small corals is mediated by the interaction of temperature with biomass.},

Abstract = {The presence of the cosmopolitan deep-sea coral Eguchipsammia fistula
   has recently been documented in the Red Sea, occurring in warm (> 20
   degrees C), oxygen-and nutrient-limited habitats. We collected colonies
   of this species from the central Red Sea that successfully resided in
   aquaria for more than one year. During this period the corals were
   exposed to increased oxygen levels and nutrition ad libitum unlike in
   their natural habitat. Specimens of long-termreared E. fistula colonies
   were incubated for 24 h and calcification (G) as well as respiration
   rates (R) were measured. In comparison to on-board measurements of G and
   R rates on freshly collected specimens, we found that G was increased
   while R was decreased. E. fistula shows extensive tissue growth and
   polyp proliferation in aquaculture and can be kept at conditions that
   notably differ from its natural habitat. Its ability to cope with rapid
   and prolonged changes in regard to prevailing environmental conditions
   indicates a wide physiological plasticity. This may explain in part the
   cosmopolitan distribution of this species and emphasizes its value as a
   deep-sea coral model to study mechanisms of acclimation and adaptation.},

   photophysiology of the explants (1 week old) closely matched that of the
   parent coral F. granulosa. This study provides the first empirical basis
   for supporting the use of coral explants as laboratory models for
   studying coral symbioses. In particular, it highlights how these small,
   self-sustaining, skeleton-free models can be useful for a number of
   molecular, genetic and physiological analyses necessary for
   investigating host-symbiont interactions at the microscale.},

Abstract = {Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) influences near-shore coral reef
   ecosystems worldwide. SGD biogeochemistry is distinct, typically with
   higher nutrients, lower pH, cooler temperature and lower salinity than
   receiving waters. SGD can also be a conduit for anthropogenic nutrients
   and other pollutants. Using Bayesian structural equation modelling, we
   investigate pathways and feedbacks by which SGD influences coral reef
   ecosystem metabolism at two Hawai'i sites with distinct aquifer
   chemistry. The thermal and biogeochemical environment created by SGD
   changed net ecosystem production (NEP) and net ecosystem calcification
   (NEC). NEP showed a nonlinear relationship with SGD-enhanced nutrients:
   high fluxes of moderately enriched SGD (Wailupe low tide) and low fluxes
   of highly enriched SGD (Kupikipiki'o high tide) increased NEP, but high
   fluxes of highly enriched SGD (Kupikipiki'o low tide) decreased NEP,
   indicating a shift toward microbial respiration. pH fluctuated with NEP,
   driving changes in the net growth of calcifiers (NEC). SGD enhances
   biological feedbacks: changes in SGD from land use and climate change
   will have consequences for calcification of coral reef communities, and
   thereby shoreline protection.},

Abstract = {On July 25, 2016, turbid water and dead corals, sponges and other
   invertebrates were discovered at the East Bank (EB) of the Flower Garden
   Banks (FGB) National Marine Sanctuary. Mortality was spread over 0.06
   km(2), with up to 80\% coral mortality reported in some areas. Within
   days, response efforts were underway to investigate the potential
   mechanisms leading to the mortality event. Hydrographic surveys, moored
   buoy data, and a regional hydrodynamic model were used to characterize
   water chemistry, hydrography, and microbial communities within the FGB.
   Low salinity (\~{} 31-33), total alkalinity (\~{} 2284-2330 mu mol
   kg(-1)), and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC, \~{} 1968-2011 mu mol
   kg(-1)) were detected in surface waters over the EB and eastern
   stations, revealing the presence of river-derived water. The
   Mississippi/Atchafalaya rivers were the primary sources of freshwater
   during the event, although Texas rivers, all of which had unusually high
   discharge during 2016, contributed approximately one-fifth to the total
   freshwater mass. At 75 m depth, high density, salinity, DIC, ammonium,
   and abundance of microbial taxa associated with deep waters were
   coincident with low temperature and aragonite saturation state at the
   northern and eastern stations, indicating a deeper source water at these
   stations. Cross-slope density gradients were also consistent with an
   upwelling circulation pattern. Using these observations and data, we
   hypothesize that the mortality event was most likely caused by the
   combination of two processes. The turbid freshwater layer inhibited
   photosynthesis, leading to net respiration of coral reef organic matter.
   Additionally, deep, dense waters upwelled onto the bank and formed a
   stratified bottom layer, which prevented re-oxygenation from the
   overlying water column and led to localized areas of hypoxia within
   pockets on the reef. Hypoxia likely formed rapidly, within two days.
   Moving forward, high-frequency temporal measurements of oxygen and
   carbonate chemistry are critical for monitoring risks (e.g., hypoxia and
   acidification) associated with freshwater discharge and upwelling, since
   these processes may adversely affect coral reef health.},

Title = {High-temperature acclimation strategies within the thermally tolerant

Abstract = {The dinoflagellate Symbiodinium trenchii associates with a wide array of
   host corals throughout the world, and its thermal tolerance has made it
   of particular interest within the context of reef coral resilience to a
   warming climate. However, future reefs are increasingly likely to face
   combined environmental stressors, further complicating our understanding
   of how S. trenchii will possibly acclimatize to future climate
   scenarios. Over a 33-day period, we characterized the individual and
   combined affects of high temperature (26.5 vs. 31.5 degrees C), pCO(2)
   (400 vs. 760 mu atm), and elevated nutrients (0.4 and 0.2 vs. 3.5 and
   0.3 mu mol of NO3/NO2 and PO43-, respectively) on S. trenchii within the
   host coral species Turbinaria reniformis. Global analysis across all
   treatments found temperature to be the largest driver of physiological
   change. However, exposure to elevated temperature led to changes in
   symbiont physiology that differed across pCO(2) concentrations. Net
   photosynthesis and cellular chlorophyll a increased with temperature
   under ambient pCO(2), whereas temperature-related differences in
   cellular volume and its affect on pigment packaging were more pronounced
   under elevated pCO(2). Furthermore, increased nutrients mitigated the
   physiological response to high temperature under both ambient and
   elevated pCO(2) conditions and represented a significant interaction
   between all three physical parameters. Individual responses to
   temperature and pCO(2) were also observed as cellular density declined
   with elevated temperature and calcification along with respiration rates
   declined with increased pCO(2). Symbiodinium trenchii remained the
   dominant symbiont population within the host across all treatment
   combinations. Our results reveal distinct physiological changes in
   response to high temperature within the S. trenchii/T. reniformis
   symbioses that are dependent on pCO(2) and nutrient concentration, and
   represent important interactive effects to consider as we consider how
   corals will respond under future climate change scenarios.},

Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Number = {3},
Pages = {907-920},

Abstract = {The physiology of ectotherms living in marine environments is strongly
   influenced by their local thermal experience. Scleractinian corals
   living near their thermal optimums are increasingly vulnerable to
   bleaching and mortality as oceanic heat waves increase globally.
   Mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) below 30 m depths are
   characteristically cooler than adjacent shallow water reefs, which
   according to theory should result in differential metabolic responses to
   temperature between depths. How local temperatures influence
   physiological responses in mesophotic corals is poorly understood. We
   compared thermal sensitivities of four coral species between a shallow
   (5-10 m) and upper-mesophotic (30-35 m) reef in Bermuda. Thermal
   performance curves (TPC) were measured in laboratory mesocosms for four
   common coral species (Diploria labyrinthiformis, Orbicella franksi,
   Montastraea cavernosa andPorites astreoides) across a wide range of
   temperatures (19-36). Our results indicate that the maximum rate of
   gross photosynthetic (GP) performance (GP-P-max) and the mean overall
   photosynthetic rates (GP-lnc) varied significantly among species. In
   contrast, thermal sensitivity (P-max, T-opt, lnc, E, Eh, or Th) did not
   vary between depths for conspecifics except for deactivation energy
   (GP-Eh) in D. labyrinthiformis. Additionally, gross respiration (R) did
   not differ among species or between depths for any thermal metric.
   Similar metabolic responses between depths suggest that local adaptation
   and/or acclimatization to different thermal conditions is likely not
   occurring. Instead, upper-mesophotic corals in Bermuda do not have lower
   bleaching thresholds than shallow water conspecifics, but similar
   thermal sensitivities supporting the potential for MCEs to function as a
   thermal refuge.},

   Reef Building Coral},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 11},
Abstract = {As atmospheric levels of CO2 increase, reef-building corals are under
   greater stress from both increased sea surface temperatures and
   declining sea water pH. To date, most studies have focused on either
   coral bleaching due to warming oceans or declining calcification due to
   decreasing oceanic carbonate ion concentrations. Here, through the use
   of physiology measurements and cDNA microarrays, we show that changes in
   pH and ocean chemistry consistent with two scenarios put forward by the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) drive major changes in
   gene expression, respiration, photosynthesis and symbiosis of the coral,
   Acropora millepora, before affects on biomineralisation are apparent at
   the phenotype level. Under high CO2 conditions corals at the phenotype
   level lost over half their Symbiodinium populations, and had a decrease
   in both photosynthesis and respiration. Changes in gene expression were
   consistent with metabolic suppression, an increase in oxidative stress,
   apoptosis and symbiont loss. Other expression patterns demonstrate
   upregulation of membrane transporters, as well as the regulation of
   genes involved in membrane cytoskeletal interactions and cytoskeletal
   remodeling. These widespread changes in gene expression emphasize the
   need to expand future studies of ocean acidification to include a wider
   spectrum of cellular processes, many of which may occur before impacts
   on calcification.},

Title = {Quantitative interpretation of vertical profiles of calcium and pH in
   the coral coelenteron},
Journal = {MARINE CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {204},
Pages = {62-69},
Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {Scleratinian corals (hard corals) and their symbiotic algae are the
   ecological engineers of biodiverse and geological important coral reef
   habitats. The complex, linked physiological processes that enable the
   holobiont (coral + algae) to calcify and generate reef structures are
   consequently of great interest. However, the mechanism of calcification
   is difficult to study for several reasons including the small spatial
   scales of the processes and the close coupling between the symbiont and
   host. In this study, we explore the utility of pH and Ca2+
   microelectrodes for constraining the rates and spatial distribution of
   photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification. The work focuses on
   vertical profiles of pH and Ca2+ through the coelenteron cavity, a
   semi-isolated compartment of modified seawater amenable to quantitative
   interpretation. In two studied species, Turbincuia reniformis and
   Acropora nallepora, Ca2+ concentrations decreased in a roughly linear
   manner from the mouth to the base of the coelenteron, indicating the
   primary physiological process affecting Ca2+ concentration is removal
   for calcification below the coelenteron. In contrast, the H+
   concentration remained relatively constant over much of the coelenteron
   cavity before it increased sharply toward the base of the coelenteron,
   indicative of proton-pumping from the calcification fluid below. The
   estimated H+ gradient between the coelenteron cavity and the
   calcification site was > 10 times higher than previously predicted.
   Consequently, the energy required to export protons from the calcifying
   fluid was estimated to be similar to 3 times higher than previously
   calculated. A one-dimensional reaction-diffusion model was used to
   interpret the pH profile considering the effects of photosynthesis,
   respiration, and calcification. This model provided a good fit to the
   observed pH profile and helped to constrain the rates and spatial
   distribution of these processes. Our modeling results also suggested
   that adult corals with deeper polyps may be more sensitive to ocean
   acidification (OA) because of enhanced difficulty to transport H+ out of
   the coelenteron and into the surrounding seawater.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Knowledge on interactive effects of global (e.g. ocean warming) and
   local stressors (e.g. pollution) is needed to develop appropriate
   management strategies for coral reefs. Surfactants and diesel are common
   coastal pollutants, but knowledge of their effects on hard corals as key
   reef ecosystem engineers is scarce. This study thus investigated the
   physiological reaction of Pocillopora verrucosa from Lombok, Indonesia,
   to exposure with a) the water-soluble fraction of diesel (determined by
   total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH); 0.69 +/- 0.14 mg L-1), b)
   the surfactant linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS; 0.95 +/- 0.02 mg L-1)
   and c) combinations of each pollutant with high temperature (+3 degrees
   C). To determine effects on metabolism, respiration, photosynthetic
   efficiency and coral tissue health were measured. Findings revealed no
   significant effects of diesel, while LAS resulted in severe coral tissue
   losses (16-95\% after 84 h). High temperature led to an increase in
   photosynthetic yield of corals after 48 h compared to the control
   treatment, but no difference was detected thereafter. In combination,
   diesel and high temperature significantly increased coral dark
   respiration, whereas LAS and high temperature caused higher tissue
   losses (81-100\% after 84 h) and indicated a severe decline in maximum
   quantum yield. These results confirm the hypothesized combined effects
   of high temperature with either of the two investigated pollutants. Our
   study demonstrates the importance of reducing import of these pollutants
   in coastal areas in future adaptive reef management, particularly in the
   context of ocean warming.},

Abstract = {Light is one of the most important abiotic factors influencing the
   (skeletal) growth of scleractinian corals. Light stimulates coral growth
   by the process of light-enhanced calcification, which is mediated by
   zooxanthellar photosynthesis. However, the quantity of light that is
   available for daily coral growth is not only determined by light
   intensity (i.e. irradiance), but also by photoperiod (i.e. the light
   duration time). Understanding and optimizing conditions for coral growth
   is essential for sustainable coral aquaculture. Therefore, in this
   study, the question was explored whether more light (i.e. more photons),
   presented either as irradiance or as light duration, would result in
   more growth. A series of nine genetically identical coral colonies of
   Galaxea fascicularis L. were cultured for a period of 18 weeks at
   different light duration times (8 hours 150 mu E m(-2) s(-1):16 hours
   dark, 12 hours 150 mu E m(-2) s(-1):12 hours dark, 16 hours 150 mu E
   m(-2) s(-1):8 hours dark, 24 hours 150 mu E m(-2) s(-1):0 hours dark)
   and different irradiance levels (8 hours 150 mu E m(-2) s(-1):16 hours
   dark, 8 hours 225 mu E m(-2) s(-1):16 hours dark and 8 hours 300 mu E
   m(-2) s(-1): 16 hours dark). Growth was determined every two weeks by
   measuring buoyant weight. Temperature, salinity and feeding levels were
   kept constant during the experiment. To detect possible acclimation of
   the corals to an increased light duration, rates of net photosynthesis
   and dark respiration were measured, hereby comparing coral colonies
   grown under an 8:16 hours light (150 mu E m(-2) s(-1)): dark cycle with
   corals grown under a 16:8 hours light (150 mu E m(-2) s(-1)): dark
   cycle. No increase in growth was detected with either increasing
   photoperiod or irradiance. Continuous lighting (24 hours 150 mu E m(-2)
   s(-1):0 hours dark) resulted in immediate bleaching and the corals died
   after 14 weeks. Hourly photosynthetic rates were significantly reduced
   in the 16 hour light treatment compared to the 8 hour light treatment.
   As a result, daily net photosynthetic rates were not significantly
   different, which may explain the observed specific growth rates.
   Acclimation to photoperiod duration appeared neither to be mediated by
   changes in chlorophyll-a concentration nor zooxanthellae density. Based
   on the results of this study, we can conclude that the enhancing effect
   of light on coral growth is not only a matter of photons. Obviously, the
   availability of light was not limiting growth in these experiments and
   was probably in excess (i.e. stressful amounts). Other factors are
   discussed that play a role in determining growth rates and might explain
   our results.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic pressures have driven large-scale declines in coral cover
   on >50\% of tropical coral reefs. Most research efforts have focused on
   ocean warming, ocean acidification, and overfishing impacts. Despite
   increasing instances of reef-associated hypoxic events, the role of

   species to one control treatment (6.8 mg O-2 L-1) and three reduced
   dissolved oxygen treatments (5.25, 3.5, and 1.25 mg O-2 L-1) during a
   10-day experiment. Across the two species, maximum (Fv/Fm) and effective
   (F'/F-m') photochemical efficiency, chlorophyll a, and dark respiration
   declined under the lowest O-2 treatment (1.25 mg O-2 L-1). Porites sp.
   coral fragments, however, were remarkably resistant and showed no signs
   of sublethal bleaching after 10 days of exposure to reduced O-2.
   Conversely, 17\% of G. fascicularis fragments bleached after only three
   nights of exposure to the lowest O-2 treatment (1.25 mg O-2 L-1). Our
   data show that longer-term hypoxic events (i.e., days to weeks) can
   induce coral bleaching, but these effects depend on the extent of O-2
   reduction and are likely species-specific. Importantly, the levels of
   O-2 usually defined as hypoxic (similar to 2.0 to 2.8 mg O-2 L-1) do not
   adequately capture the thresholds reported here. Hence, further research
   is urgently needed to more accurately describe the vulnerability of
   coral taxa to hypoxic and anoxic events.},

Title = {Microbiome of a Reef-Building Coral Displays Signs of Acclimation to a
   Stressful Shallow Hydrothermal Vent Habitat},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Most tropical reef corals live at temperatures near 27 degrees C and pH
   values near 8. Conditions outside of these can stress corals and lead to
   bleaching, disease, and death. However, some corals can survive in
   marginal or extreme habitats outside of these ranges. To date there is a
   paucity of knowledge about the role that associated microbes may play in
   the acclimation of corals to such extreme habitats. Here, we explore
   differences in the compositional and functional profile of the
   microbiomes of the scleractinian coral Porites panamensis living both on
   and off potentially stressful shallow-water hydrothermal vents. The
   environment near the vents is extreme, with temperatures exceeding 80
   degrees C and pH values below 6. Coral microbiomes under stress often
   exhibit increased diversity, increased abundance of pathogenic bacteria,
   and functional profiles that shift toward pathways associated with
   pathogenic taxa. Samples from along a transect that crossed an arc of
   hydrothermal vents were sequenced for the 16S rRNA gene (V4 region).
   On-vent coral microbiomes were distinct from those of off-vent corals,
   but did not have increased alpha or beta diversity. On-vent samples had
   a higher relative abundance of the beneficial endosymbiont,
   Endozoicomonas. On- and off-vent microbiomes did not differ in overall
   abundance of the endolithic green alga Ostreobium, however, a single
   ASV, close to O. quekettii was more abundant in on-vent corals.
   Ostreobium can provide many of the same benefits to corals as
   zooxanthellae and their symbiosis is better maintained under thermal
   stress. Surprisingly, on-vent coral microbiomes had fewer microbial taxa
   that are known to be pathogenic or associated with stress than did
   off-vent corals. The predicted functional profiles of on-vent
   microbiomes revealed enrichment of pathways related to aerobic
   respiration, fermentation and amino acid biosynthesis, but not of
   virulence-related pathways. Our results suggest that P. panamensis
   microbiomes have acclimated to the extreme environment of the
   hydrothermal vent habitat rather than showing signs of stress. These
   results exemplify the need to focus efforts on examining the mechanisms
   of resilience, including symbioses with microbiota, in corals living in
   extreme environments in an effort to design better management strategies
   for reef-building corals under thermal and pH stress.</p>},

Abstract = {Scleractinian cold-water corals (CWC) represent key taxa controlling
   deep-sea reef ecosystem functioning by providing structurally complex
   habitats to a high associated biodiversity, and by fuelling
   biogeochemical cycles via the release of organic matter. Nevertheless,
   our current knowledge on basic CWC properties, such as feeding ecology
   and key physiological processes (i.e. respiration, calcification and
   organic matter release), is still very limited. Here, we show evidence
   for the trophic significance of zooplankton, essentially sustaining
   levels of the investigated key physiological processes in the
   cosmopolitan CWC Desmophyllum dianthus (Esper 1794). Our results from
   laboratory studies reveal that withdrawal (for up to 3 weeks) of
   zooplankton food (i.e. Artemia salina) caused a significant decline in
   respiration (51\%) and calcification (69\%) rates compared with
   zooplankton-fed specimens. Likewise, organic matter release, in terms of
   total organic carbon (TOC), decreased significantly and eventually
   indicated TOC net uptake after prolonged zooplankton exclusion. In fed
   corals, zooplankton provided 1.6 times the daily metabolic C demand,
   while TOC release represented 7\% of zooplankton-derived organic C.
   These findings highlight zooplankton as a nutritional source for D.
   dianthus, importantly sustaining respiratory metabolism, growth and
   organic matter release, with further implications for the role of CWC as
   deep-sea reef ecosystem engineers.},

Abstract = {A small-scale chamber experimental system was designed to study the
   effects of temperature on colony-level coral metabolism. The system
   continuously supplies fresh seawater to the chamber, where it is mixed
   immediately and completely with the seawater already present. This
   continuous-flow complete-i-nixing system (CFCM system), in conjunction
   with theoretical equations, allows quantitative determination of
   chemical uptake and release rates by coral under controlled
   environmental conditions. We used the massive hermatypic coral
   Goniastrea aspera to examine variations in pH, total alkalinity, and
   total inorganic carbon for 16 days at 27 degrees C under controlled
   light intensities (300 and 0 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). we confirmed the
   stability of the CFCM system with respect to coral photosynthetic and
   calcification fluxes. In addition, we obtained daily photosynthetic and
   calcification rates at different temperatures (27 degrees C, 29 degrees
   C, 31 degrees C, and 33 degrees C). When seawater temperature was raised
   from 31 degrees C to 33 degrees C, the gross primary production rate
   (P-gross) decreased 29.5\%, and the calcification rate (G) decreased
   85.7\% within 2 days. The CFCM system allows quantitative evaluation of
   coral colony chemical release and uptake rates, and metabolism. (c) 2008

Title = {Baseline respiration and spontaneous activity of sluggish marine
   tropical fish of the family Scorpaenidae},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {219},
Pages = {229-239},
Abstract = {Baseline respiration and spontaneous activity were determined
   simultaneously for 6 specimens of tropical scorpionfishes, belonging to
   2 different genera: Scorpaenopsis oxycephalus and S. diabolus (false
   stonefish) and Parascorpaena sp. and R aurita. The experiments were
   conducted in an intermittent-flow respirometer at 24 degreesC, at
   ambient light regime (12 h dark: 12 h light) and salinity (S = 32).
   Permanent measurements of fish activity by an infrared video system
   (number of movements) and oxygen consumption were coupled allowing the
   calculation of a standard oxygen consumption (SOC) rate. The
   experimental set-up allowed quantification of spontaneous activity.
   Relative SOC values varied between 32.3 mg O-2 h(-1) kg(-1) wet mass
   (wm) for a large S. oxycephalus (82 g WM) and 68.9 mg O-2 h(-1) kg(-1)
   WM for the smallest investigated specimen, a P. aurita (16 g WM), The
   latter also showed the highest spontaneous activity rate (mean 98
   movements h(-1); max,: 870 h(-1)), while the values for the most
   sluggish individual did not exceed 24.6 h(-1) (mean) and 480 h(-1)
   (mam), respectively. Absolute SOC for a standard mass of 50 g was
   calculated to be 2.0 Mg O-2 h(-1), using a wet mass versus oxygen
   consumption relationship of SOC (mg O-2 h(-1)) = 0.26 x WM(g)(0.527).
   The tropical scorpionfish investigated are some of the most sluggish
   fish found on coral reefs, with activity levels (means and variance)
   similar to that of boreal or polar scorpaenids (e.g. sculpins). In this
   respect, there was no indication for any specific adaptation to
   temperature. Baseline oxygen consumption values of the fish in this
   study were the lowest recorded for marine tropical species, and a first
   rough comparison of the resting metabolism of scorpaenid fish over a
   wide range of environmental temperatures might indicate a reduced
   thermal sensitivity of the tropical fish investigated.},

Number = {9},
Pages = {1797-1808},

Abstract = {This study tested the effects of acclimatization on the response of
   corals to elevated temperature, using juvenile massive Porites spp. and
   branching P. irregularis from Moorea (W149A degrees 50', S17A degrees
   30'). During April and May 2006, corals were acclimatized for 15 days to
   cool (25.7A degrees C) or ambient (27.7A degrees C) temperature, under
   shaded (352 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) or ambient (554 mu mol photons
   m(-2) s(-1)) natural light, and then incubated for 7 days at ambient or
   high temperature (31.1A degrees C), under ambient light (659 mu mol
   photons m(-2) s(-1)). The response to acclimatization was assessed as
   biomass, maximum dark-adapted quantum yield of PSII (F (v)/F (m)), and
   growth, and the effect of the subsequent treatment was assessed as F
   (v)/F (m) and growth. Relative to the controls (i.e., ambient
   temperature/ambient light), massive Porites spp. responded to
   acclimatization through increases in biomass under ambient
   temperature/shade, and low temperature/ambient light, whereas P.
   irregularis responded through reduced growth under ambient
   temperature/shade, and low temperature/ambient light. Acclimatization
   affected the response to thermal stress for massive Porites spp. (but
   not P. irregularis), with an interaction between the acclimatization and
   subsequent treatments for growth. This interaction resulted from a
   lessening of the negative effects of high temperature after
   acclimatizing to ambient temperature/shade, but an accentuation of the
   effect after acclimatizing to low temperature/shade. It is possible that
   changes in biomass for massive Porites spp. are important in modulating
   the response to high temperature, with the taxonomic variation in this
   effect potentially resulting from differences in morphology. These
   results demonstrate that corals can acclimatize during short exposures
   to downward excursions in temperature and light, which subsequently
   affects their response to thermal stress. Moreover, even con-generic
   taxa differ in this capacity, which could affect coral community
   structure.},

Title = {Thermal and pCO(2) Stress Elicit Divergent Transcriptomic Responses in a
   Resilient Coral},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {The oceans are becoming warmer and more acidic as a result of rising
   atmospheric pCO(2). Transcriptome plasticity may facilitate marine
   organisms' acclimation to thermal and acidification stress by tailoring
   gene expression to mitigate the impacts of these stressors. Here, we
   produce the first transcriptome of the abundant, ubiquitous, and
   resilient Caribbean reef-building coral Siderastrea siderea, and
   investigate this corals' transcriptomic response to 95 days of thermal
   (T = 25, 28, 32 degrees C) and CO2-induced acidification (324, 477, 604,
   2553 mu atm) stress. The S. siderea transcriptome was assembled using
   RNAseq and then Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis was employed
   to obtain systems-level insights into the coral's stress response.
   Exposure of the coral to both elevated temperature and acidification
   elicited strong but divergent transcriptomic responses. Gene Ontology
   analysis suggests that long-term thermal stress disrupts homeostasis by
   increasing transcription of protein-coding genes associated with protein
   catabolism and suppressing transcription of genes involved in responding
   to environmental stimuli. Both next century (604 mu atm) and
   extreme-high (2553 mu atm) pCO(2) stress increased transcription of
   genes associated with respiration, highlighting the potentially greater
   energetic requirements of maintaining calcification under high-pCO(2)
   conditions. Under extreme-high pCO(2), increased transcription of
   H+-transporter genes was observed, consistent with the proposed role of
   proton transport in facilitating coral calcification under elevated
   pCO(2). These results suggest that 95 days of exposure to 32 degrees C
   seawater elicits a more adverse transcriptomic response (i.e., broad
   scale reductions in gene expression) than exposure to extreme-high
   acidification (2553 mu atm; i.e., increased expression of genes
   associated with ion transport) within S. siderea-with the response to
   extreme warming suggesting cellular shutdown and the response to extreme
   acidification indicating capacity for acclimation. These results are
   consistent with the observation that rates of net calcification for the
   investigated corals were more negatively affected by the prescribed
   thermal stress than by the prescribed acidification stress. This study
   demonstrates how transcriptome plasticity may promote coral acclimation
   to these global change stressors, but that there are limits to the
   efficacy of this plasticity.},

Abstract = {We examined quantitative changes in the metabolism of the coral Galaxea
   fascicularis caused by increases in both hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
   concentration and seawater temperature. Seawater temperatures were
   maintained at 27 or 31A degrees C in a well-controlled incubation
   chamber, and three levels of H2O2 concentration (0, 0.3, 3.0 mu M) were
   used in experimental treatments. Gross primary production, calcification
   rates and respiration rates were all affected by increased H2O2
   concentrations and high seawater temperatures. Individual treatments of
   high H2O2 or elevated seawater temperature alone caused significant
   declines in coral photosynthesis and calcification rates within the
   3-day incubation period. The synergistic effect of high H2O2 combined
   with high seawater temperature resulted in a 134\% increase in
   respiration rates, which surpassed the effect of either H2O2 or high
   seawater temperature alone. Our results suggest that both high H2O2
   concentrations and elevated temperatures in seawater can strongly affect
   coral metabolism; however, these effects cannot be estimated by simply
   summing the effects of individual stress parameters.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to test whether elevated pCO(2)

   Seriatopora caliendrum (Ehrenberg 1834) either independently or
   interactively with high temperature (30.5 A degrees C). Response
   variables detected the sequence of events associated with the onset of
   bleaching: reduction in the photosynthetic performance of symbionts as
   measured by maximum photochemical efficiency (F (v)/F (m)) and effective
   photochemical efficiency (Delta F/F (m)') of PSII, declines in net

   caliendrum was collected from Nanwan Bay, Taiwan, and subjected to
   combinations of temperature (27.7 vs. 30.5 A degrees C) and pCO(2) (45.1
   vs. 85.1 Pa) for 14 days. High temperature reduced values of all
   dependent variables (i.e., bleaching occurred), but high pCO(2) did not
   affect Symbiodinium photophysiology or productivity, and did not cause
   bleaching. These results suggest that short-term exposure to 81.5 Pa
   pCO(2), alone and in combination with elevated temperature, does not

Abstract = {Ocean warming and acidification caused by increases of atmospheric
   carbon dioxide are now thought to be major threats to coral reefs on a
   global scale. Here we evaluated the environmental conditions and benthic
   community structures in semi-closed Nikko Bay at the inner reef area in
   Palau, which has high pCO(2) and seawater temperature conditions with
   high zooxanthellate coral coverage. Nikko Bay is a highly sheltered
   system with organisms showing low connectivity with surrounding
   environments, making this bay a unique site for evaluating adaptation
   and acclimatization responses of organisms to warmed and acidified
   environments. Seawater pCO(2)/Omega (arag) showed strong gradation
   ranging from 380 to 982 mu atm (Omega (arag): 1.79-3.66), and benthic
   coverage, including soft corals and turf algae, changed along with Omega
   (arag) while hard coral coverage did not change. In contrast to previous
   studies, net calcification was maintained in Nikko Bay even under very
   low mean Omega (arag) (2.44). Reciprocal transplantation of the dominant
   coral Porites cylindrica showed that the calcification rate of corals
   from Nikko Bay did not change when transplanted to a reference site,
   while calcification of reference site corals decreased when transplanted
   to Nikko Bay. Corals transplanted out of their origin sites also showed
   the highest interactive respiration (R) and lower gross photosynthesis
   (Pg) to respiration (Pg:R), indicating higher energy acquirement of
   corals at their origin site. The results of this study give important
   insights about the potential local acclimatization and adaptation
   capacity of corals to different environmental conditions including

Abstract = {Global degradation of coral reefs has increased the urgency of
   identifying stress-tolerant coral populations, to enhance understanding
   of the biology driving stress tolerance, as well as identifying stocks
   of stress-hardened populations to aid reef rehabilitation. Surprisingly,
   scientists are continually discovering that naturally extreme
   environments house established coral populations adapted to grow within
   extreme abiotic conditions comparable to seawater conditions predicted
   over the coming century. Such environments include inshore mangrove
   lagoons that carry previously unrecognised ecosystem service value for
   corals, spanning from refuge to stress preconditioning. However, the
   existence of such hot-spots of resilience on the Great Barrier Reef
   (GBR) remains entirely unknown. Here we describe, for the first time, 2
   extreme GBR mangrove lagoons (Woody Isles and Howick Island), exposing
   taxonomically diverse coral communities (34 species, 7 growth
   morphologies) to regular extreme low pH (<7.6), low oxygen (<1 mg l(-1))
   and highly variable temperature range (>7 degrees C) conditions. Coral
   cover was typically low (<5 \%), but highly patchy and included
   established colonies (>0.5 m diameter), with net photosynthesis and
   calcification rates of 2 dominant coral species (Acropora millepora,

   revealed that physiological plasticity (photosynthetic `strategy') and

   supporting coral capacity to thrive from reef to lagoon. Prevalence of
   corals within these extreme conditions on the GBR (and elsewhere)
   increasingly challenge our understanding of coral resilience to
   stressors, and highlight the need to study unfavourable coral
   environments to better resolve mechanisms of stress tolerance.},

Abstract = {The threats of wide-scale coral bleaching and reef demise associated
   with anthropogenic climate change are widely known. Moreover, rates of
   genetic adaptation and/or changes in the coral-zooxanthella partnerships
   are considered unlikely to be sufficiently fast for corals to acquire
   increased physiological resistance to increasing sea temperatures and
   declining pH. However, it has been suggested that coral reef resilience
   to climate change may be improved by good local management of coral
   reefs, including management of water quality. Here, using major data
   sets from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, we investigate
   geographic patterns of coral bleaching in 1998 and 2002 and outline a
   synergism between heat stress and nutrient flux as a major causative
   mechanism for those patterns. The study provides the first concrete
   evidence for the oft-expressed belief that improved coral reef
   management will increase the regional-scale survival prospects of coral
   reefs to global climate change.},

Title = {Assessing the effects of iron enrichment across holobiont compartments
   reveals reduced microbial nitrogen fixation in the Red Sea coral
   Pocillopora verrucosa},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},

Volume = {7},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The productivity of coral reefs in oligotrophic tropical waters is
   sustained by an efficient uptake and recycling of nutrients. In
   reef-building corals, the engineers of these ecosystems, this nutrient
   recycling is facilitated by a constant exchange of nutrients between the
   animal host and endosymbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellates
   (zooxanthellae), bacteria, and other microbes. Due to the complex
   interactions in this so-called coral holobiont, it has proven difficult
   to understand the environmental limitations of productivity in corals.
   Among others, the micronutrient iron has been proposed to limit primary
   productivity due to its essential role in photosynthesis and bacterial
   processes. Here, we tested the effect of iron enrichment on the
   physiology of the coral Pocillopora verrucosa from the central Red Sea
   during a 12-day experiment. Contrary to previous reports, we did not see
   an increase in zooxanthellae population density or gross photosynthesis.
   Conversely, respiration rates were significantly increased, and
   microbial nitrogen fixation was significantly decreased. Taken together,
   our data suggest that iron is not a limiting factor of primary
   productivity in Red Sea corals. Rather, increased metabolic demands in
   response to iron enrichment, as evidenced by increased respiration
   rates, may reduce carbon (i.e., energy) availability in the coral
   holobiont, resulting in reduced microbial nitrogen fixation. This
   decrease in nitrogen supply in turn may exacerbate the limitation of
   other nutrients, creating a negative feedback loop. Thereby, our results
   highlight that the effects of iron enrichment appear to be strongly
   dependent on local environmental conditions and ultimately may depend on
   the availability of other nutrients.},

   A re-evaluation using experimental coral bleaching as a case study},

Abstract = {Coral skeletal delta C-13 can be a paleo-climate proxy for light levels
   (i.e., cloud cover and seasonality) and for photosynthesis to
   respiration (P/R) ratios. The usefulness of coral delta C-13 as a proxy
   depends on metabolic isotope effects (related to changes in
   photosynthesis) being the dominant influence on skeletal delta C-13.
   However, it is also influenced by kinetic isotope effects (related to
   calcification rate) which can overpower metabolic isotope effects and
   thus compromise the use of coral skeletal delta C-13 as a proxy. Heikoop
   et al. (2000) proposed a simple data correction to remove kinetic
   isotope effects from coral skeletal delta C-13, as well as an equation
   to calculate P/R ratios from coral isotopes. However, despite having
   been used by other researchers, the data correction has never been
   directly tested, and isotope-based P/R ratios have never been compared
   to P/R ratios measured using respirometry. Experimental coral bleaching
   represents a unique environmental scenario to test this because
   bleaching produces large physiological responses that influence both
   metabolic and kinetic isotope effects in corals. Here, we tested the
   delta C-13 correction and the P/R calculation using three Pacific and
   three Caribbean coral species from controlled temperature-induced
   bleaching experiments where both the stable isotopes and the
   physiological variables that cause isotopic fractionation (i.e.,
   photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification) were simultaneously
   measured. We show for the first time that the data correction proposed
   by Heikoop et al. (2000) does not effectively remove kinetic effects in
   the coral species studied here, and did not improve the metabolic signal
   of bleached and non-bleached corals. In addition, isotope-based P/R
   ratios were in poor agreement with measured P/R ratios, even when the
   data correction was applied. This suggests that additional factors
   influence delta C-13 and delta O-18, which are not accounted for by the
   data correction. We therefore recommend that the data correction not be
   routinely applied for paleo-climate reconstruction, and that P/R ratios
   should only be obtained by direct measurement by respirometry. (C) 2014

Journal = {CORAL REEFS},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Coral polyps have a fluid-filled internal compartment, the
   gastrovascular cavity (GVC). Respiration and photosynthesis cause large
   daily excursions in GVC oxygen concentration (O-2) and pH, but few
   studies have examined how this correlates with calcification rates. We
   hypothesized that GVC chemistry can mediate and ameliorate the effects
   of decreasing seawater pH (pH(SW)) on coral calcification.
   Microelectrodes were used to monitor O(2)and pH within the GVC
   ofMontastraea cavernosaandDuncanopsammia axifuga(pH only) in both the
   light and the dark, and three pH(SW)levels (8.2, 7.9, and 7.6). At
   pH(SW)8.2, GVC O(2)ranged from ca. 0 to over 400\% saturation in the
   dark and light, respectively, with transitions from low to high (and
   vice versa) within minutes of turning the light on or off. For all three
   pH(SW)treatments and both species, pH(GVC)was always significantly above
   and below pH(SW)in the light and dark, respectively. ForM. cavernosain
   the light, pH(GVC)reached levels of pH 8.4-8.7 with no difference among
   pH(SW)treatments tested; in the dark, pH(GVC)dropped below pH(SW)and
   even below pH 7.0 in some trials at pH(SW)7.6. ForD. axifugain both the
   light and the dark, pH(GVC)decreased linearly as pH(SW)decreased.
   Calcification rates were measured in the light concurrent with
   measurements of GVC O(2)and pH(GVC). For both species, calcification
   rates were similar at pH(SW)8.2 and 7.9 but were significantly lower at
   pH(SW)7.6. Thus, for both species, calcification was protected from
   seawater acidification by intrinsic coral physiology at pH(SW)7.9 but
   not 7.6. Calcification was not correlated with pH(GVC)forM. cavernosabut
   was forD. axifuga.These results highlight the diverse responses of
   corals to changes in pH(SW), their varying abilities to control pH(GVC),
   and consequently their susceptibility to ocean acidification.},

Abstract = {Rising seawater temperature and ocean acidification threaten the
   survival of coral reefs. The relationship between coral physiology and
   its microbiome may reveal why some corals are more resilient to these
   global change conditions. Here, we conducted the first experiment to
   simultaneously investigate changes in the coral microbiome and coral
   physiology in response to the dual stress of elevated seawater
   temperature and ocean acidification expected by the end of this century.
   Two species of corals, Acropora millepora containing the thermally
   sensitive endosymbiont C21a and Turbinaria reniformis containing the
   thermally tolerant endosymbiont Symbiodinium trenchi, were exposed to
   control (26.5 degrees C and pCO(2) of 364 mu atm) and treatment (29.0
   degrees C and pCO(2) of 750 mu atm) conditions for 24 days, after which
   we measured the microbial community composition. These microbial
   findings were interpreted within the context of previously published
   physiological measurements from the exact same corals in this study
   (calcification, organic carbon flux, ratio of photosynthesis to
   respiration, photosystem II maximal efficiency, total lipids, soluble
   animal protein, soluble animal carbohydrates, soluble algal protein,
   soluble algal carbohydrate, biomass, endosymbiotic algal density, and
   chlorophyll a). Overall, dually stressed A. millepora had reduced
   microbial diversity, experienced large changes in microbial community
   composition, and experienced dramatic physiological declines in
   calcification, photosystem II maximal efficiency, and algal
   carbohydrates. In contrast, the dually stressed coral T. reniformis
   experienced a stable and more diverse microbiome community with minimal
   physiological decline, coupled with very high total energy reserves and
   particulate organic carbon release rates. Thus, the microbiome changed
   and microbial diversity decreased in the physiologically sensitive coral
   with the thermally sensitive endosymbiotic algae but not in the
   physiologically tolerant coral with the thermally tolerant endosymbiont.
   Our results confirm recent findings that temperature-stress tolerant
   corals have a more stable microbiome, and demonstrate for the first time
   that this is also the case under the dual stresses of ocean warming and
   acidification. We propose that coral with a stable microbiome are also
   more physiologically resilient and thus more likely to persist in the
   future, and shape the coral species diversity of future reef ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The feeding strategies of Montipora digitata and Porites lutea, two
   dominant corals in the Okinawan reefs, were investigated. The focus was
   on pico- and nanoplankton feeding efficiencies, using 6-h incubations.
   Although healthy M. digitata consumed from 72\% to 87\% more
   pico-nanoplankton cells than P. lutea, feeding rates of bleached corals
   of both species were similarly low at heat stress (33 degrees C).
   Heterotrophic carbon acquisition with respect to dark respiration varied
   from 3\% to 65\% in M. digitata and from 7\% to 68\% in P. lutea. A
   decrease in the feeding efficiency of bleached M. digitata under heat
   stress shows its vulnerability to water heating events. Feeding rates of
   P. lutea were low under all conditions and treatments; therefore, this
   species is less vulnerable to heat stress due to the strategy of meeting
   metabolic costs by using translocated organic matter from endoliths and
   selecting pico-nanoplankton cells with a high C/N ratio.},

Abstract = {Reef-building corals respond to the temporal integration of both pulse
   events (i.e., heat waves) and press thermal history (i.e., local
   environment) via physiological changes, with ecological consequences. We
   used a ``press-pulse-press{''} experimental framework to expose the
   brooding coral Porites astreoides to various thermal histories to
   understand the physiological response of temporal dynamics within and
   across generations. We collected adult colonies from two reefs (outer
   Rim reef and inner Patch reef) in Bermuda with naturally contrasting
   thermal regimes as our initial ``press{''} scenario, followed by a
   21-day ex situ ``pulse{''} thermal stress of 30.4 degrees C during
   larval brooding, and a ``press{''} year-long adult reciprocal transplant
   between the original sites. Higher endosymbiont density and holobiont
   protein was found in corals originating from the lower thermal
   variability site (Rim) compared to the higher thermal variability site
   (Patch). The thermal pulse event drove significant declines in
   photosynthesis, endosymbiont density, and chlorophyll a, with bleaching
   phenotype convergence for adults from both histories. Following the
   reciprocal transplant, photosynthesis was higher in previously heated
   corals, indicating recovery from the thermal pulse. The effect of origin
   (initial press) modulated the response to transplant site for
   endosymbiont density and chlorophyll a, suggesting contrasting
   acclimation strategies. Higher respiration and photosynthetic rates were
   found in corals originating from the Rim site, indicating greater energy
   available for reproduction, supported by larger larvae released from Rim
   corals post-transplantation. Notably, parental exposure to the pulse
   thermal event resulted in increased offspring plasticity when parents
   were transplanted to foreign sites, highlighting the legacy of the pulse
   event and the importance of the environment during recovery in
   contributing to cross-generational or developmental plasticity.
   Together, these findings provide novel insight into the role of
   historical disturbance events in driving differential outcomes within
   and across generations, which is of critical importance in forecasting
   reef futures.},

Abstract = {N-2 fixation by coral reef benthic substrates may support primary
   productivity on oligo trophic coral reefs. However, little is known
   regarding the influence of environmental para meters on coral reef
   benthic N-2 fixation. This study quantified N-2 fixation and
   photosynthesis in 3 common reef framework substrates: turf algae, coral
   rock, and the abundant encrusting sponge Mycale fistulifera over 4
   seasons in the northern Gulf of Aqaba. N-2 fixation activity was
   detected during day and night for all substrates, but on an annual
   average was significantly higher for turf algae (4.4 +/- 3.9 nmol C2H4
   cm(-2) h(-1)) and coral rock (3.5 +/- 2.8 nmol C2H4 cm(-2) h(-1))
   compared to M. fistulifera (0.2 +/- 0.2 nmol C2H4 cm(-2) h(-1)). There
   was strong seasonality in N-2 fixation, with rates one order of
   magnitude higher in summer when temperature and irradiance were highest
   but inorganic nutrient concentrations lowest. During summer and fall,
   when nutrients were low, we found a significant positive linear
   relationship between gross photosynthesis (P-gross) and N-2 fixation in
   turf algae and coral rock. Further, we estimate N-2 fixation can supply
   up to 20 and 27\% of the N demand for net photosynthesis (P-net) in
   coral rock and turf algae, respectively. By contrast there was no
   significant relationship between N-2 fixation and Pgross in M.
   fistulifera, which displayed negative Pnet and heterotrophic metabolism
   (P-gross: respiration <1). These findings highlight the role of
   environmental parameters in regulating benthic substrate-associated N-2
   fixation and the potential importance of fixed N for supporting primary
   production, particularly during nutrient-depleted conditions.},

   changes of the zooxanthellae population dynamics. Prolonged starvation
   (40 days) caused a 50\% loss of zooxanthellae, a 70\% decrease in
   photosynthesis (P calculated per polyp), a 3-fold decrease in
   proliferating zooxanthellae frequency (PZF) and two-three-fold increase
   in degrading zooxanthellae frequency (DZF). The increase of the numbers
   of zooxanthellae in various stages of degradation was closely coupled to
   an increase in the release of degraded zooxanthellae particles (dzp). At
   the same time, zooxanthellae volume increased by 80\% but chlorophyll
   content and the photosynthetic capacity of the zooxanthellae did not
   change. Polyps subjected to osmotic shock (17 parts per thousand)
   expelled about one third of their zooxanthellae along with elements of
   animal cells. PZF and DZF levels varied slightly. We assume that
   zooxanthellae densities in corals are a consequence of differential
   rates of zooxanthellae division and degradation regulated by the coral

   densities regulated by expulsion of healthy zooxanthellae.},

Abstract = {Coastal oceans are increasingly eutrophic, warm and acidic through the
   addition of anthropogenic nitrogen and carbon, respectively. Among the
   most sensitive taxa to these changes are scleractinian corals, which
   engineer the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth. Corals' sensitivity is
   a consequence of their evolutionary investment in symbiosis with the
   dinoflagellate alga, Symbiodinium. Together, the coral holobiont has
   dominated oligotrophic tropical marine habitats. However, warming
   destabilizes this association and reduces coral fitness. It has been
   theorized that, when reefs become warm and eutrophic, mutualistic
   Symbiodinium sequester more resources for their own growth, thus
   parasitizing their hosts of nutrition. Here, we tested the hypothesis
   that sub- bleaching temperature and excess nitrogen promotes symbiont
   parasitism by measuring respiration (costs) and the assimilation and
   translocation of both carbon (energy) and nitrogen (growth; both
   benefits) within Orbicella faveolata hosting one of two Symbiodinium
   phylotypes using a dual stable isotope tracer incubation at ambient (26
   degrees C) and sub- bleaching (31 degrees C) temperatures under elevated
   nitrate. Warming to 31 degrees C reduced holobiont net primary
   productivity (NPP) by 60\% due to increased respiration which decreased
   host \% carbon by 15\% with no apparent cost to the symbiont.
   Concurrently, Symbiodinium carbon and nitrogen assimilation increased by
   14 and 32\%, respectively while increasing their mitotic index by 15\%,
   whereas hosts did not gain a proportional increase in translocated
   photosynthates. We conclude that the disparity in benefits and costs to
   both partners is evidence of symbiont parasitism in the coral symbiosis
   and has major implications for the resilience of coral reefs under
   threat of global change.},

Abstract = {Stress-tolerant coral species, such as Platygyra spp., are considered to
   be well adapted to survive in marginal reefs, but their physiological
   response to short term exposure to abnormally high temperature and
   lowered salinity remains poorly understood. Using non-invasive
   techniques to quantitatively assess the health of Platygyra carnosa
   (e.g. respiration, photosynthesis, biocalcification and whiteness), we
   identified the plasticity of its energetics and physiological limits.
   Although these indicators suggest that it can survive to increasing
   temperature (25-32 degrees C), its overall energetics were seriously
   diminished at temperatures > 30 degrees C. In contrast, it was well
   adapted to hyposaline waters (31-21 psu) but with reduced
   biocalcification, indicating short term adaptation for expected future
   changes in salinity driven by increased amounts and intensities of
   precipitation. Our findings provide useful insights to the effect of
   these climate drivers on P. carnosa metabolism and thus better forecast
   changes in their health status under future climate change scenarios.},

Title = {Summer Oxygen Dynamics on a Southern Arabian Gulf Coral Reef},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 23},
Abstract = {During the summer the Arabian Gulf is the world's warmest sea, also
   characterized by hypersalinity and extreme annual temperature
   fluctuations (12-35(o)C), making it marginal for coral growth. Yet
   extensive reefs occur in all eight nations bordering the Gulf. Here we
   present data demonstrating recurrent summer hypoxia events {[}oxygen
   concentration (O-2) <2 mg l(-1)] at a reef in the southern Gulf.
   Currently these episodes are short enough (median 3 h, max 10 h) to
   preclude mass mortality. Will this always be the case? Predicting future
   Gulf hypoxia risk for coral reef ecosystems requires diagnosing the
   underlying causes driving the timing and magnitude of O-2 swings. To
   this end, we compare our data with the output of a simple coupled 1-D
   water column/biogeochemical model of the reef environment. This allows
   us to give quantitative estimates of the O-2 fluxes produced by
   photosynthesis both in the water column and within the coral framework,
   by respiration processes in the benthos, and from the atmosphere. We
   demonstrate the role of turbulent mixing, and in particular of tides, in
   shaping the temporal variability of the amplitude of the diel O-2 cycle.
   We find that, in spite of significant turbulent mixing, which maintains
   the temperature vertically well-mixed, the biological O-2 production and
   consumption is dominant over the atmospheric O-2 flux, and is sufficient
   to generate vertical differences of 1 to 5 mg l(-1) between the bottom
   and 1.5 m above it. While estimating future trends of hypoxia frequency
   will require further study, the present findings single out the relevant
   physical and biological processes (and their interplay) which deserve
   further scrutiny. The Gulf today experiences temperatures expected to
   occur across much of the tropics by the end of the century, and the
   observation of recurrent hypoxia events in the Gulf suggests that
   similar hypoxic phenomena may represent an important, but to date
   underappreciated, threat to the future of global coral reefs.},

Abstract = {Biological mediation of carbonate dissolution represents a fundamental
   component of the destructive forces acting on coral reef ecosystems.
   Whereas ocean acidification can increase dissolution of carbonate
   substrates, the combined impact of ocean acidification and warming on
   the microbioerosion of coral skeletons remains unknown. Here, we exposed
   skeletons of the reef-building corals, Porites cylindrica and Isopora
   cuneata, to present-day (Control: 400 atm 24 degrees C) and future
   pCO2temperature scenarios projected for the end of the century (Medium:
   +230 atm +2 degrees C; High: +610 atm +4 degrees C). Skeletons were also
   subjected to permanent darkness with initial sodium hypochlorite
   incubation, and natural light without sodium hypochlorite incubation to
   isolate the environmental effect of acidic seawater (i.e., aragonite <1)
   from the biological effect of photosynthetic microborers. Our results
   indicated that skeletal dissolution is predominantly driven by
   photosynthetic microborers, as samples held in the dark did not
   decalcify. In contrast, dissolution of skeletons exposed to light
   increased under elevated pCO2temperature scenarios, with P. cylindrica
   experiencing higher dissolution rates per month (89\%) than I. cuneata
   (46\%) in the high treatment relative to control. The effects of future
   pCO2temperature scenarios on the structure of endolithic communities
   were only identified in P. cylindrica and were mostly associated with a
   higher abundance of the green algae Ostreobium spp. Enhanced skeletal
   dissolution was also associated with increased endolithic biomass and
   respiration under elevated pCO2temperature scenarios. Our results
   suggest that future projections of ocean acidification and warming will
   lead to increased rates of microbioerosion. However, the magnitude of
   bioerosion responses may depend on the structural properties of coral
   skeletons, with a range of implications for reef carbonate losses under
   warmer and more acidic oceans.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are experiencing unprecedented declines in health on a
   global scale leading to severe reductions in coral cover. One major
   cause of this decline is increasing sea surface temperature. However,
   conspecific colonies separated by even small spatial distances appear to
   show varying responses to this global stressor. One factor contributing
   to differential responses to heat stress is variability in the coral's
   micro-environment, such as the amount of water flow a coral experiences.
   High flow provides corals with a variety of health benefits, including
   heat stress mitigation. Here, we investigate how water flow affects
   coral gene expression and provides resilience to increasing
   temperatures. We examined host and photosymbiont gene expression of
   Acropora cf. pulchra colonies in discrete in situ flow environments
   during a natural bleaching event. In addition, we conducted controlled
   ex situ tank experiments where we exposed A. cf. pulchra to different
   flow regimes and acute heat stress. Notably, we observed distinct
   flow-driven transcriptomic signatures related to energy expenditure,
   growth, heterotrophy and a healthy coral host-photosymbiont
   relationship. We also observed disparate transcriptomic responses during
   bleaching recovery between the high- and low-flow sites. Additionally,
   corals exposed to high flow showed ``frontloading{''} of specific
   heat-stress-related genes such as heat shock proteins, antioxidant
   enzymes, genes involved in apoptosis regulation, innate immunity and
   cell adhesion. We posit that frontloading is a result of increased
   oxidative metabolism generated by the increased water movement. Gene
   frontloading may at least partially explain the observation that
   colonies in high-flow environments show higher survival and/or faster
   recovery in response to bleaching events.},

Abstract = {Mass coral bleaching events caused by elevated seawater
   temperatures(1,2) have resulted in extensive coral mortality throughout
   the tropics over the past few decades(3,4). With continued global
   warming, bleaching events are predicted to increase in frequency and
   severity, causing up to 60\% coral mortality globally within the next
   few decades(4-6). Although some corals are able to recover and to
   survive bleaching(7,8), the mechanisms underlying such resilience are
   poorly understood. Here we show that the coral host has a significant
   role in recovery and resilience. Bleached and recovering Montipora
   capitata (branching) corals met more than 100\% of their daily metabolic
   energy requirements by markedly increasing their feeding rates and CHAR
   (per cent contribution of heterotrophically acquired carbon to daily
   animal respiration), whereas Porites compressa (branching) and Porites
   lobata (mounding) corals did not. These findings suggest that coral
   species with high-CHAR capability during bleaching and recovery,
   irrespective of morphology, will be more resilient to bleaching events
   over the long term, could become the dominant coral species on reefs,
   and may help to safeguard affected reefs from potential local and global

Abstract = {Pelagic larvae play a fundamental role in the life history of virtually
   all scleractinian corals, yet much of their biology remains unexplored.
   One aspect of coral larvae - their response to temperature perturbations
   has potentially important consequences for understanding the effects of
   global warming and El Nino-Southern Oscillation events on coral
   recruitment. The present study tests the effects of temperature
   perturbations on coral larvae using Porites astreoides larvae as a model
   system. In June 1999, larvae were collected from 18 m depth on Conch
   Reef, Florida, and incubated at ambient (28 degreesC), depressed (26
   degreesC), and elevated (33 degreesC) temperatures in outdoor tanks
   shaded from direct sunlight. Treatments were repeated with new larvae
   every 24 h, and treatment effects quantified as larval motility,
   mortality. metamorphosis and metabolism. Elevated temperature
   significantly increased mortality and metamorphosis, and a similar trend
   was observed at the reduced temperature, although this was not
   significant. Neither elevated nor reduced temperatures affected larval
   motility. Gross photosynthesis (P) was significantly depressed by
   elevated and reduced temperatures, and respiration (R) varied
   proportionately with temperature (Q(10)approximate to2), although this
   effect was not statistically Significant. At the highest temperature the
   P/R ratio declined to < 1, indicating that thermal stress reduces the
   potential for autotrophy. Together, these results suggest that elevated
   temperatures affect coral larvae by depressing photosynthesis and
   creating an energy shortage, which ultimately could reduce recruitment
   (by increasing mortality), shorten larval longevity and favor premature
   metamorphosis. An unexpected finding was that larvae differed
   physiologically among release dates. Although preliminary, this suggests
   that larval fitness in Porites spp. may vary depending on the day of
   release, a phenomenon that could have significant ramifications with
   respect to the population structure of adults.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {215-225},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Despite high rates of photosynthetic oxygen production during the day,
   the warm waters of coral reefs are susceptible to hypoxia at night due
   to elevated respiration rates at higher temperatures that also reduce
   the solubility of oxygen. Hypoxia may be a challenge for coral-reef fish
   that hide in the reef to avoid predators at night. Triggerfishes
   (Balistidae) are found in a variety of reef habitats, but they also are
   known to find refuge in reef crevices and holes at night, which may
   expose them to hypoxic conditions. The critical oxygen tension (P
   (crit)) was determined as the point below which oxygen uptake could not
   be maintained to support standard metabolic rate (SMR) for five species
   of triggerfish. The triggerfishes exhibited similar levels of hypoxia
   tolerance as other coral-reef and coastal marine fishes that encounter
   low oxygen levels in their environment. Two species, Rhinecanthus
   rectangulus and R. aculeatus, had the lowest P (crit) (similar to 3.0
   kPa O-2), comparable to the most hypoxia-tolerant obligate
   coral-dwelling gobies, while Odonus niger and Sufflamen bursa were
   moderately tolerant to hypoxia (P (crit) similar to 4.5 kPa), and
   Xanthichthys auromarginatus was intermediate (P (crit) similar to 3.7
   kPa). These differences in P (crit) were not due to differences in
   oxygen demand, as all the species had a similar SMR once mass
   differences were taken into account. The results suggest that
   triggerfish species are adapted for different levels of hypoxia exposure
   during nocturnal sheltering within the reef.},

   release by the coral Acropora tenuis},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {Release rates of particulate organic carbon and nitrogen (POC and PON)
   and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the scleractinian coral Acropora
   tenuis were measured during the day and night in summer and winter
   seasons. Physiological parameters including calcification,
   photosynthesis and respiration rates were also measured simultaneously.
   The release rate of both POC and DOC was significantly higher in summer
   compared to winter and higher during the day compared to the night. The
   daily release rate of total organic carbon (POC + DOC) was 1,094 and 219
   mu mol C cm(-2) d(-1) for summer and winter, respectively, being 4.9
   times higher in summer. The POC:PON ratios of the particulate organic
   matter released during daytime in both seasons (summer: 12.8 +/- 5.7,
   winter: 12.0 +/- 4.1) were significantly higher than those during
   nighttime (summer: 6.1 +/- 2.5, winter: 2.2 +/- 1.8). The DOC:POC ratio
   was 0.5 +/- 0.03 during summer and 0.32 +/- 0.98 during winter,
   suggesting higher mucus release in particulate form. Daily net
   production was estimated to be 199 and 158 mu g C cm(-2) d(-1) for
   summer and winter, respectively, with the amount of carbon released as
   mucus accounting for 6.5\% and 1.6\% of the net carbon fixation,
   respectively. The study reveals diurnal and seasonal changes in the
   quantity and quality of mucus released from this coral species. Since
   coral mucus is used as a food source by reef macro-organisms, and can
   also serve as an energy source for micro-organisms, the observed changes
   in mucus release rates are expected to influence the seasonal dynamics
   of organic carbon and nitrogen cycling over coral reefs.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I utilise the CO2 (sink) limitation model of coral

   the conferred fitness benefits arising from such a mechanistic linkage

   caution against the ultimate benefit of the mechanism for raising
   bleaching thresholds at the coral community (reef) scale. Future

   Chamber for Coral Physiological Measurements},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are threatened worldwide, with environmental stressors
   increasingly affecting the ability of reef-building corals to sustain
   growth from calcification (G), photosynthesis (P) and respiration (R).
   These processes support the foundation of coral reefs by directly
   influencing biogeochemical nutrient cycles and complex ecological
   interactions and therefore represent key knowledge required for
   effective reef management. However, metabolic rates are not trivial to
   quantify and typically rely on the use of cumbersome in situ
   respirometry chambers and/or the need to remove material and examine ex
   situ, thereby fundamentally limiting the scale, resolution and possibly
   the accuracy of the rate data. Here we describe a novel low-cost in situ
   respirometry bag that mitigates many constraints of traditional glass
   and plexi-glass incubation chambers. We subsequently demonstrate the
   effectiveness of our novel ``Flexi-Chamber{''} approach via two case
   studies: 1) the Flexi-Chamber provides values of P, R and G for the
   reef-building coral Siderastrea cf. stellata collected from reefs close
   to Salvador, Brazil, which were statistically similar to values
   collected from a traditional glass respirometry vessel; and 2)
   wide-scale application of obtaining P, R and G rates for different
   species across different habitats to obtain inter- and intra-species
   differences. Our novel cost-effective design allows us to increase
   sampling scale of metabolic rate measurements in situ without the need
   for destructive sampling and thus significantly expands on existing
   research potential, not only for corals as we have demonstrated here,
   but also other important benthic groups.},

Abstract = {Studying carbon dynamics in the coral holobiont provides essential
   knowledge of nutritional strategies and is thus central to understanding
   coral ecophysiology. In this study, we assessed the carbon budget in
   Pocillopora damicornis (using (HCO3)-C-13) as a function of feeding
   status and temperature stress. We also compared dissolved oxygen (O-2)
   fluxes measured at the colony scale and at the polyp scale. At both
   scales, O-2 production rates were enhanced for fed vs. unfed corals, and
   unfed corals exhibited higher bleaching and reduced photosynthetic
   activity at high temperature. Unfed corals exclusively respired
   autotrophically acquired carbon, while fed corals mostly respired
   heterotrophically acquired carbon. As a consequence, fed corals excreted
   on average > 5 times more organic carbon than unfed corals.
   Photosynthate translocation was higher under thermal stress, but most of
   the carbon was lost via respiration and/or mucus release (42-46\% and
   57-75\% of the fixed carbon for unfed and fed corals, respectively).
   Such high loss of translocated carbon, coupled to low assimilation rates
   in the coral tissue and symbionts, suggests that P. damicornis was
   nitrogen and/or phosphorus limited. Heterotrophy might thus cover a
   larger portion of the nutritional demand for P. damicornis than
   previously assumed. Our results suggest that active feeding plays a
   fundamental role in metabolic dynamics and bleaching susceptibility of
   corals.},

Abstract = {Coral reef organisms are increasingly and simultaneously affected by
   global and local stressors such as ocean acidification (OA) and reduced
   light availability. However, knowledge of the interplay between OA and
   light availability is scarce. We exposed 2 calcifying coral reef species
   (the scleractinian coral Acropora millepora and the green alga Halimeda
   opuntia) to combinations of ambient and increased pCO(2) (427 and 1073
   mu atm, respectively), and 2 light intensities (35 and 150 mu mol
   photons m(-2) s(-1)) for 16 d. We evaluated the individual and combined
   effects of these 2 stressors on weight increase, calcification rates,
   O-2 fluxes and chlorophyll a content for the species investigated.
   Weight increase of A. millepora was significantly reduced by OA (48\%)
   and low light intensity (96\%) compared to controls. While OA did not
   affect coral calcification in the light, it decreased calcification in
   the dark by 155\%, leading to dissolution of the skeleton. H. opuntia
   weight increase was not affected by OA, but decreased (40\%) at low
   light. OA did not affect algae calcification in the light, but decreased
   calcification in the dark by 164\%, leading to dissolution. Low light
   significantly reduced gross photosynthesis (56 and 57\%), net
   photosynthesis (62 and 60\%) and respiration (43 and 48\%) of A.
   millepora and H. opuntia, respectively. In contrast to A. millepora, H.
   opuntia significantly increased chlorophyll content by 15\% over the
   course of the experiment. No interactive effects of OA and low light
   intensity were found on any response variable for either organism.
   However, A. millepora exhibited additive effects of OA and low light,
   while H. opuntia was only affected by low light. Thus, this study
   suggests that negative effects of low light and OA are additive on
   corals, which may have implications for management of river discharge
   into coastal coral reefs.},

Abstract = {Understanding the role of coral reefs on air-sea CO2 exchange is
   essential to accurately estimate carbon budgets throughout the tropical
   and subtropical oceans. Results from research conducted in humid marine
   environments show coral reefs are mainly net sources of CO2 to the
   atmosphere due to calcification being dominant over respiration and
   dissolution. However, coral reefs are also found bordering deserts in
   the subtropical high-pressure belt. Here, we present results from
   concurrent direct measurements of air-sea CO2 exchange over fringing
   coral reefs and open sea bordered by hyper-arid deserts in the Gulf of
   Eilat (Aqaba). The fringing coral reefs were found to be a net sink of
   CO2 at -1.62 +/- 4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) sequestering 1.96 times more CO2
   than adjacent open sea. The CO2 fluxes showed a negative correlation
   with some local meteorological parameters such as humidity, wind speed,
   and net radiation but were positively correlated to air temperature. The
   air-sea CO2 fluxes were also found to be correlated with dust, which is
   believed to trigger metabolic processes in bacteria and phytoplankton in
   the low-nutrient, low-chlorophyll sea of the study site. Results are
   compared to measurements from the humid marine setting of the Great

Abstract = {To evaluate the effects of temperature and pCO(2) on coral larvae,
   brooded larvae of Pocillopora damicornis from Nanwan Bay, Taiwan (21A
   degrees 56.179'N, 120A degrees 44.85'E), were exposed to ambient
   (419-470 mu atm) and high (604-742 mu atm) pCO(2) at similar to 25 and
   similar to 29 A degrees C in two experiments conducted in March 2010 and
   March 2012. Larvae were sampled from four consecutive lunar days (LD)
   synchronized with spawning following the new moon, incubated in
   treatments for 24 h, and measured for respiration, maximum photochemical
   efficiency of PSII (F (v)/F (m)), and mortality. The most striking
   outcome was a strong effect of time (i.e., LD) on larvae performance:
   respiration was affected by an LD x temperature interaction in 2010 and
   2012, as well as an LD x pCO(2) x temperature interaction in 2012; F
   (v)/F (m) was affected by LD in 2010 (but not 2012); and mortality was
   affected by an LD x pCO(2) interaction in 2010, and an LD x temperature
   interaction in 2012. There were no main effects of pCO(2) in 2010, but
   in 2012, high pCO(2) depressed metabolic rate and reduced mortality.
   Therefore, differences in larval performance depended on day of release
   and resulted in varying susceptibility to future predicted environmental
   conditions. These results underscore the importance of considering
   larval brood variation across days when designing experiments. Subtle
   differences in experimental outcomes between years suggest that
   transgenerational plasticity in combination with unique histories of
   exposure to physical conditions can modulate the response of brooded
   coral larvae to climate change and ocean acidification.},

Abstract = {Critical to determining vulnerability or resilience of reef corals to
   Ocean Acidification (OA) is a clearer understanding of the extent to
   which corals can control carbonate chemistry in their Extracellular
   Calcifying Medium (ECM) where the CaCO3 skeleton is produced. Here, we
   employ a mathematical framework to calculate ECM aragonite saturation
   state In. Omega(arag) ((ECM))) and carbonate system ion concentration
   using measurements of calcification rate, seawater characteristics
   (temperature, salinity and pH) and ECM pH (pH((ECM))). Our calculations
   of ECM carbonate chemistry at current -day seawater pH, indicate that
   Omega(arag).(ECM) ranges from similar to 10 to 38 (mean 20.41), i.e.
   about 5 to 6-fold higher than seawater. Accordingly, Dissolved Inorganic
   Carbon (DIC) and Total Alkalinity (TA) were calculated to be around 3
   times higher in the ECM than in seawater. We also assessed the effects
   of acidification on ECM chemical properties of the coral Stylophora
   pistillata. At reduced seawater pH our calculations indicate that
   Omega(arag).((ECM)) remains almost constant.'DIC((Ecm)) and TA((Ecm))
   gradually increase as seawater pH declines, reaching values about 5 to
   6-fold higher than in seawater, respectively for DIC and TA. We propose
   that these ECM characteristics buffer the effect of acidification and
   explain why certain corals continue to produce CaCO3 even when seawater
   chemistry is less favourable. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Compounded disturbances are becoming increasingly common on coral reefs.
   Impacts of global warming, which is generally perceived as the most
   serious threat to coral reefs today, often coincide with various common
   anthropogenic disturbances, such as pollution and overharvesting. To
   better evaluate the impact of global warming, interactions between
   elevated temperature and background disturbance should be investigated.
   In this study, the physiological response of the reef-building coral
   Porites cylindrica was investigated, when exposed to enrichment of
   dissolved inorganic nitrate (+ 15 muM for 14 days) and elevated seawater
   temperature ( + 2 C for 48 h), in the absence of particulate food. It
   was shown that P. cvlindrica was able to tolerate the temperature
   exposure without losing symbiotic microalgae or chlorophyll pigments,
   although the photosynthetic capacity was affected. Nitrate enrichment
   significantly reduced primary production rate, although zooxanthella
   population density and chlorophyll concentrations were not affected. The
   combination of elevated temperature and nitrate enrichment produced an
   even more pronounced reduction of the production rate. Since coral
   respiration rate remained unaffected by the treatments, this implies
   that the corals were unable to acclimate to impaired photosynthesis.
   However, there was no indication of subsequently reduced tissue growth
   or increased host catabolism based on tissue biomass measurements. On
   the other hand, all corals, including controls, lost tissue biomass
   during the exposure, suggesting a dependence on particulate food. Our
   results imply that corals on nutrient-exposed reefs may be more stressed
   during periods of elevated temperature, compared to corals in more
   pristine areas.},

Volume = {163},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Northern Red Sea coral reefs experience pronounced seasonal variations
   in environmental factors such as water temperature, light intensity, and
   nutrient availability. This allows studying related effects on primary
   production by different functional groups. The present study therefore
   quantified primary production of all dominant benthic primary producers
   from a Jordanian fringing reef (29 degrees 27' 31 `' N, 34 degrees 58'
   26 `' E) by measuring net photosynthesis (P-n) and dark respiration (R)
   using stirred respirometry chamber incubations during all four seasons
   of 2013. Annual mean P-n was highest for the macroalga Caulerpa (901
   nmol O-2 cm(-2) h(-1)) and lowest for both the soft coral Sarcophyton
   and sedimentary microphytobenthos (212 and 223 nmol O-2 cm(-2) h(-1),
   respectively). Sedimentary microphytobenthos exhibited the strongest
   response to seasonality with 5.7 times higher P-n in spring than in
   winter. R was highest in hard corals among all groups in every season,
   likely due to nighttime calcification and heterotrophic activity. Gross
   photosynthesis-to-respiration ratios (P-g:R) were highest for turf algae
   and macroalgae as well as cyanobacterial mats. While R was primarily
   positively related to PAR and temperature and P-g:R to inorganic
   nutrients, few groups revealed significant relations between P-n and
   environmental parameters. Seasonal budgets found daily gross primary
   production and respiration to be dominated by hard and soft corals.
   Total reef gross primary production was comparable between less
   oligotrophic spring and more oligotrophic summer. This indicates that
   processes such as heterotrophic feeding and microbial dinitrogen
   fixation may help the functional groups overcome potential nutrient
   limitation of primary production in summer.},

Abstract = {Coral calcification underpins biodiverse reef ecosystems, but the
   physiology underlying the thermal sensitivity of corals to changing
   seawater temperatures remains unclear. Furthermore, light is also a key
   factor in modulating calcification rates, but a mechanistic
   understanding of how light interacts with temperature to affect coral
   calcification is lacking. Here, we characterized the thermal performance
   curve (TPC) of calcification of the wide-spread, model coral species
   Stylophora pistillata, and used gene expression analysis to investigate
   the role of ion transport mechanisms in thermally-driven declines in day
   and nighttime calcification. Focusing on genes linked to transport of
   dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), calcium and H+, our study reveals a
   high degree of coherence between physiological responses (e.g.
   calcification and respiration) with distinct gene expression patterns to
   the different temperatures in day and night conditions. At low
   temperatures, calcification and gene expression linked to DIC transport
   processes were downregulated, but showed little response to light. By
   contrast, at elevated temperature, light had a positive effect on
   calcification and stimulated a more functionally diverse gene expression
   response of ion transporters. Overall, our findings highlight the role
   of mechanisms linked to DIC, calcium and H+ transport in the thermal
   sensitivity of coral calcification and how this sensitivity is

Abstract = {Introduction As a changing climate threatens the persistence of
   terrestrial and marine ecosystems by altering community composition and
   function, differential performance of taxa highlights the need for
   predictive metrics and mechanistic understanding of the factors
   underlying positive performance in the face of environmental
   disturbances. Biochemical reactions within cells provide a snapshot of
   molecular regulation and flexibility during exposure to environmental
   stressors. However, because the organism is the unit of selection there
   is a need for the integration of metabolite data with organism
   physiology to understand mechanisms responsible for individual success
   under a changing climate.
   Objectives Our study aims to characterize the molecular response of reef
   corals to simulated global climate change stressors. Furthermore, we
   seek to relate changes in the molecular physiology to observations in
   overall colony response.
   Methods To this end, we applied a non-targeted metabolomic approach to
   describe lipid and primary metabolite composition after exposure of the
   reef-building coral Pocillopora damicornis to ambient and elevated
   experimental climate change conditions. We compared these metabolite
   data to organism physiology, specifically the key processes of
   photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification.
   Results Corals significantly altered their lipid and primary metabolite
   profiles in response to experimental treatments. Primary metabolite
   profiles predicted organisms' net photosynthesis, but not calcification
   or respiration measures. Despite challenges in metabolome annotation,
   our data indicated corals alter carbohydrate composition, cell
   structural lipids, and signaling compounds in response to elevated
   treatment conditions.
   Conclusions The integration of metabolite and physiological data
   highlights the predictive power of metabolomics in defining organism
   performance and provides biomarkers for future studies. Here, we present
   a multivariate biomarker approach to assess climate change impacts and
   advance our mechanistic understanding of stress response in this
   keystone species.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {In a changing ocean, tropical waters can be instructive as to the
   potential effects of climate induced changes on marine ecosystem
   structure and function. We describe the relationships between planktonic
   community respiration (CR), net community production (NCR), gross
   primary production (GPP), and environmental variables in 14 regions and
   three ecosystem types (coastal, coral reef, and open sea) from
   Australia, Papua New Guinea, and Indonesia. The data are compiled from
   separate studies conducted between 2002 and 2014 with the goal of better
   parameterizing the metabolic balance in tropical marine waters. Overall,
   these regions were strongly autotrophic (average GPP:CR ratio: 2.14 +/-
   0.98), though our dataset of 783 paired measurements did include some
   oceanic stations where heterotrophy (GPP:CR < 1) was predominant, and
   some coastal stations that were intermittently heterotrophic. Our
   statistical analysis suggested that temperature was the most important
   determinant of CR in coral reef and ocean ecosystems but less so in
   coastal ecosystems, where chlorophyll concentration was more important.
   In contrast, chlorophyll and sampling depth were more important in
   regulating GPP than temperature. The relationships between temperatures
   and metabolic rates showed that these were ecosystem-dependent, with
   coastal ecosystems showing less response to temperature than coral reef
   and open sea sites. The threshold of GPP to achieve metabolic balance
   fell in a range between 0.715 mmol O-2 m(-3) d(-1) in the Coral Sea to
   10.052 mmol O-2 m(-3) d(-1) in mangrove waterways of Hinchinbrook
   Channel. These data allow regions in and around northern Australia to be
   ranked in terms of trophic state, ranging from the oligotrophic Scott
   Reef (GPP:CR = 0.84 +/- 0.08) to productive surface waters of the
   Kimberley coast (GPP:CR = 5.21 +/- 0.62). The measurement of pelagic
   metabolism shows potential as a quantitative tool to monitor the trophic
   state of coastal waters.},

Abstract = {Rates of gross primary production (GPP), respiration (R), and net

   response to global warming (and the consequent increase in sea surface
   temperature) and coastal eutrophication (and the subsequent increase in
   the concentration of organic matter, OM, being filtered by permeable
   coral reef carbonate sediments). To date, no studies have examined the
   combined effect of seawater warming and OM enrichment on coral reef
   carbonate sediment metabolism and dissolution. This study used 22 h in
   situ benthic chamber incubations to examine the combined effect of
   temperature (T) and OM, in the form of coral mucus and phytodetritus, on
   GPP, R, and G(net) in the permeable coral reef carbonate sediments of
   Heron Island lagoon, Australia. Compared to control incubations, both
   warming (+2.4 degrees C) and OM increased R and GPP. Under warmed
   conditions, R (Q(10) = 10.7) was enhanced to a greater extent than GPP
   (Q(10) = 7.3), resulting in a shift to net heterotrophy and net
   dissolution. Under both phytodetritus and coral mucus treatments, GPP
   was enhanced to a greater extent than R, resulting in a net increase in
   GPP / R and G(net). The combined effect of warming and OM enhanced R and
   GPP, but the net effect on GPP / R and G(net) was not significantly
   different from control incubations. These findings show that a shift to
   net heterotrophy and dissolution due to short-term increases in seawater
   warming may be countered by a net increase GPP / R and G(net) due to
   short-term increases in nutrient release from OM.},

Title = {Coral reefs modify their seawater carbon chemistry - implications for

Abstract = {Reviews suggest that that the biogeochemical threshold for sustained
   coral reef growth will be reached during this century due to ocean
   acidification caused by increased uptake of atmospheric CO2. Projections
   of ocean acidification, however, are based on air-sea fluxes in the open
   ocean, and not for shallow-water systems such as coral reefs. Like the
   open ocean, reef waters are subject to the chemical forcing of
   increasing atmospheric pCO(2). However, for reefs with long water
   residence times, we illustrate that benthic carbon fluxes can drive
   spatial variation in pH, pCO(2) and aragonite saturation state
   (Omega(a)) that can mask the effects of ocean acidification in some
   downstream habitats. We use a carbon flux model for photosynthesis,
   respiration, calcification and dissolution coupled with Lagrangian
   transport to examine how key groups of calcifiers (zooxanthellate
   corals) and primary producers (macroalgae) on coral reefs contribute to
   changes in the seawater carbonate system as a function of water
   residence time. Analyses based on flume data showed that the carbon
   fluxes of corals and macroalgae drive Omega(a) in opposing directions.
   Areas dominated by corals elevate pCO(2) and reduce Omega(a), thereby
   compounding ocean acidification effects in downstream habitats, whereas
   algal beds draw CO2 down and elevate Omega(a), potentially offsetting
   ocean acidification impacts at the local scale. Simulations for two CO2
   scenarios (600 and 900 ppm CO2) suggested that a potential shift from
   coral to algal abundance under ocean acidification can lead to improved
   conditions for calcification in downstream habitats, depending on reef
   size, water residence time and circulation patterns. Although the carbon
   fluxes of benthic reef communities cannot significantly counter changes
   in carbon chemistry at the scale of oceans, they provide a significant
   mechanism of buffering ocean acidification impacts at the scale of
   habitat to reef.},

Abstract = {Climate change poses a major threat to coral reefs. We conducted an
   outdoor 22-month experiment to investigate if coral could not just
   survive, but also physiologically cope, with chronic ocean warming and
   acidification conditions expected later this century under the Paris
   Climate Agreement. We recorded survivorship and measured eleven
   phenotypic traits to evaluate the holobiont responses of Hawaiian coral:
   color, Symbiodiniaceae density, calcification, photosynthesis,
   respiration, total organic carbon flux, carbon budget, biomass, lipids,
   protein, and maximum Artemia capture rate. Survivorship was lowest in
   Montipora capitata and only some survivors were able to meet metabolic
   demand and physiologically cope with future ocean conditions. Most M.
   capitata survivors bleached through loss of chlorophyll pigments and
   simultaneously experienced increased respiration rates and negative
   carbon budgets due to a 236\% increase in total organic carbon losses
   under combined future ocean conditions. Porites compressa and Porites
   lobata had the highest survivorship and coped well under future ocean
   conditions with positive calcification and increased biomass,
   maintenance of lipids, and the capacity to exceed their metabolic demand
   through photosynthesis and heterotrophy. Thus, our findings show that
   significant biological diversity within resilient corals like Porites,
   and some genotypes of sensitive species, will persist this century
   provided atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are controlled. Since Porites
   corals are ubiquitous throughout the world's oceans and often major reef
   builders, the persistence of this resilient genus provides hope for
   future reef ecosystem function globally.},

Abstract = {In this study, we tested whether larvae brooded by the reef coral
   Pocillopora damicornis from a naturally extreme and highly variable
   environment are preadapted to cope with predicted increases in
   temperature and pCO(2). We exposed larvae to two temperatures (29 vs.
   30.8 degrees C) crossed with two pCO(2) levels (similar to 500 vs.
   similar to 1000 mu atm) in a full-factorial experiment for 5 d. Larval
   performance was assessed as dark respiration (R-D), net and gross
   photosynthesis (P-N and P-G, respectively), survival, settlement, and
   the activity of carbonic anhydrase (CA), the central enzyme involved in
   photosynthesis. The results showed that R-D was unaffected by either
   elevated temperature or pCO(2), while elevated temperature and/or pCO(2)
   stimulated P-N and P-G and increased the ratios of P-N to R-D,
   indicating a relatively higher autotrophic capacity. Consequently,
   larval survivorship under elevated temperature and/or pCO(2) was
   consistently 14\% higher than that under the control treatment.
   Furthermore, elevated temperature and pCO(2) did not affect host CA
   activity, but synergistically enhanced symbiont CA activity,
   contributing greatly to the stimulated photosynthetic capacity. These
   results suggest that brooded larvae of P. damicornis larvae from
   Luhuitou may be preadapted to cope with projected warming and ocean
   acidification. More generally, it appears that corals from highly
   variable environments may have increased resilience to the widespread
   climate change.},

Abstract = {The influence of temperature and inorganic carbon (C-i) concentration on
   photosynthesis was examined in whole corals and samples of cultured
   symbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium sp.) using combined measurements
   from a membrane inlet mass spectrometer and chl a fluorometer. In whole
   corals, O-2 production at 26 degrees C was significantly limited at C-i
   concentrations below ambient seawater (similar to 2.2 mM). Further
   additions of C-i up to similar to 10 mM caused no further stimulation of
   oxygenic photosynthesis. Following exposure to 30 degrees C (2 d), net
   oxygen production decreased significantly in whole corals, as a result
   of reduced production of photosynthetically derived oxygen rather than
   increased host consumption. Whole corals maintained a rate of oxygen
   evolution around eight times lower than cultured Symbiodinium sp. at
   inorganic carbon concentrations < 2 mM, but cultures displayed greater
   levels of photoinhibition following heat treatment (30 degrees C, 2 d).
   Whole corals and cultured zooxanthellae differed considerably in their
   responses to C-i concentration and moderate heat stress, demonstrating
   that cultured Symbiodinium make an incongruous model for those in
   hospite. Reduced net oxygen evolution, in whole corals, under conditions
   of low C-i (< 2 mM) has been interpreted in terms of possible sink
   limitation leading to increased nonphotochemical energy dissipation. The
   advantages of combined measurement of net gas exchange and fluorometry
   offered by this method are discussed.},

Title = {Is citrate synthase an energy biomarker in Southwestern Atlantic corals?
   A comparative, biochemical approach under a simulated scenario of
   climate change},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {213-222},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Southwestern Atlantic (SWA) corals are more tolerant to global
   warming than those from the Caribbean Sea, possibly due to their higher
   heterotrophy and flexibility of symbiotic associations in nutrient-rich
   waters. Increased heterotrophy promotes greater energy gain via
   increased mitochondrial respiration, which can be used to face
   unfavorable conditions. Citrate synthase (CS) is a pacemaker enzyme of
   cellular respiration, and its activity can be used as a proxy for
   maximum aerobic capacity, thus being a potential predictor of organism
   tolerance against climate change. Therefore, we hypothesized that
   endemic coral species from SWA would have higher CS activity than those
   of pan-Caribbean distribution after exposure to a simulated scenario of
   moderate climate change (seawater temperature increase: + 2.5 degrees C;
   seawater acidification: - 0.3 pH unit), according to IPCC. Seven species
   of scleractinian corals and one hydrocoral species were biochemically
   evaluated in a phylogenetic perspective. Favia gravida, Mussismilia
   harttii, Montastraea cavernosa, Porites astreoides and Siderastrea
   stellata were unresponsive regarding CS activity, whereas Millepora
   alcicornis, Mussismilia hispida and Porites branneri showed a
   compensatory effect. Regardless of their phylogenetic relationships,
   endemic SWA coral species revealed higher CS activity than those of
   pan-Caribbean distribution. We suggest that the unique evolutionary
   history of SWA endemic species contributes to their biochemical
   tolerance to climate change, thus supporting the hypothesis of SWA as a
   refuge for reef life. Although CS is not a suitable biomarker for
   assessing the putative effects of climate change owing to its
   species-specific responses, it is an informative metric to indicate
   stress tolerance of species with different biogeographic origins. This
   idea becomes particularly evident for SWA reefs, where such a
   comparative, biochemical approach highlights the greater tolerance of
   endemic species at the subcellular level of organization.},

Volume = {145},

Abstract = {Air-sea CO2 exchanges and the partial pressure of CO2 were measured in
   surface water overlying 2 coral reefs: Moorea (French Polynesia, austral
   winter, August 1992), where coral diversity and surface cover are low,
   and Yonge Reef (Great Barrier Reef, austral summer, December 1993),
   where coral diversity and cover are comparatively higher. A procedure is
   proposed to estimate the potential CO2 exchange with the atmosphere by
   taking into account both the saturation level of oceanic seawater and
   the equilibration process occurring after water leaves the reef. It is
   shown that both sites were net sources of CO2 to the atmosphere as a
   result of the effect of calcification on the dynamics of the inorganic
   carbon system. The potential global CO2 evasion from the ocean to the
   atmosphere is about 4 times higher at Yonge Reef than at Moorea. It is
   also demonstrated that, at both sites, the major exchange of CO2 from
   sea to air occurs as seawater returns to chemical equilibrium after it
   has crossed and left the reef. The dynamics of inorganic carbon were
   studied using the so-called homogeneous buffer factor {[}beta =
   dln(pCO(2))/dln(DIC)] (where pCO(2) is the CO2 partial pressure in
   surface water and DIC is dissolved inorganic carbon), which gave
   estimates that approximately 80\% of the change in inorganic carbon was
   related to photosynthesis and respiration. This approach showed that the
   calcification rate was proportional to the net organic production during
   the day and to the respiration rate at night.},

   Insights from calcification fluid DIC chemistry},
Journal = {CHEMICAL GEOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {497},
Pages = {162-169},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {Ocean acidification typically reduces calcification in tropical marine
   corals but the mechanism for this process is not understood. We use
   skeletal boron geochemistry (B/Ca and delta B-11) to reconstruct the
   calcification fluid DIC of corals cultured over both high and low
   seawater pCO(2) (180, 400 and 750 mu atm). We observe strong positive
   correlations between calcification fluid pH and concentrations of the
   DIC species potentially implicated in aragonite precipitation (be they
   CO32-, HCO3- or HCO3- + CO32-). Similarly, with the exception of one
   outlier, the fluid concentrations of precipitating DIC species are
   strongly positively correlated with coral calcification rate. Corals
   cultured at high seawater pCO(2) usually have low calcification fluid pH
   and low concentrations of precipitating DIC, suggesting that a reduction
   in DIC substrate at the calcification site is responsible for decreased
   calcification. The outlier coral maintained high pH(CF) and DICCF at
   high seawater pCO(2) but exhibited a reduced calcification rate
   indicating that the coral has a limited energy budget to support proton
   extrusion from the calcification fluid and meet other calcification
   demands. We find no evidence that increasing seawater pCO(2) enhances
   diffusion of CO2 into the calcification site. Instead the overlying
   {[}CO2] available to diffuse into the calcification site appears broadly
   comparable between seawater pCO(2) treatments, implying that metabolic
   activity (respiration and photosynthesis) generates a similar {[}CO2] in
   the vicinity of the calcification site regardless of seawater pCO(2).},

Abstract = {This study experimentally investigated the effect of an early summer
   short-term summer thermal anomaly in November on Heron Reef (Great
   Barrier Reef), on the performance of the coral-algal symbiosis during a
   subsequent, thermally induced bleaching event (defined by loss of
   symbionts) in February 2009. Fragments of the reef flat coral, Acropora
   millepora, exposed to the two heating events lost 78\% of their
   symbionts and showed a 64\% decline in dark adapted quantum yield
   (Fv/Fm) to values less than 0.25. Whereas corals that were only heated
   in the second event lost 57\% symbionts and displayed a 75\% decline in
   Fv/Fm to values less than 0.2. Coral in both pre-stressed and non
   pre-stressed treatments at 34 degrees C had net photosynthetic rates
   significantly less than zero (P-net max<0), suggesting that daytime O-2
   respiration rates were significantly greater than rates of O-2 evolution
   through photosynthesis. Increases in the daily light field and/or
   increases in temperature led to the observation of dark-adapted
   xanthophyll de-epoxidation suggesting that the potential for
   non-photochemical quenching is maintained into the dark (after 1 h dark
   adaption). Pre-stressed corals were also found to have de-epoxidation
   ratios three times greater than non pre-stressed corals at 34 degrees C
   and xanthophyll pool to Chl a, much greater than non pre-stressed
   corals. Combined, these results indicate that symbionts in pre-stressed
   corals have a greater ability to dump incoming light energy as heat We
   conclude that whilst differences were observed between pre-stressed and
   non pre-stressed populations in measurements of photosynthetic
   productivity, photosynthetic pigments and areal protein, thermal
   bleaching as defined by symbiont loss did not vary between treatments.

Abstract = {This study examines the relationship between the delta(13)C of the
   skeleton of a zooxanthellate coral (Montastraea annularis) growing on
   the Florida Reef Tract and environmental variables (insolation and
   temperature), physiological variables (growth rate, respiration,
   calcification, and photosynthesis). Colonies of this species were grown
   in the field for a 21/2 year study period, during which the rates of
   photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification were measured on fifteen
   separate occasions, spaced approximately equally throughout the study
   period. The corals were stained with alizarin-red S within seven days
   after each set of physiological measurements. At the end of the period
   the corals were sacrificed and their skeletal extension, density, and
   skeletal delta(13)C determined. Despite substantial high-frequency
   variations, a strong seasonal cycle was evident in the skeletal
   delta(13)C records of all the corals throughout the experimental period.
   The skeletal delta(13)C and delta(18)O values varied approximately in
   phase, and showed a weak, but statistically significant positive
   relationship with each other. The delta(13)C Of the coral skeletons,
   when corrected for changes in the delta(13)C of dissolved inorganic
   carbon (DIG), exhibited an inverse correlation with P/R, a finding
   opposite to what was expected based on current models of isotopic
   fractionation in coral skeletons. Although such findings tend to support
   the model of fret (1978) that increases in photosynthesis act to
   isotopically deplete the delta(13)C of the coral skeleton, we note that
   the inverse association between delta(13)C and P/R arises because of a
   slight positive association between delta(13)C and respiration. We
   therefore believe that the association may be a result of seasonal
   variation in some parameters of the system which was not constrained in
   our study. Alternatives include (1) variations in the delta(13)C of the
   DIC which are translated into the delta(13)C Of the food chain, (2)
   changes from heterotrophy to autotrophy, and (3) changes in the
   partitioning of delta(13)C between the zooxanthellae and the coral
   tissue. Based on previous studies which we have carried out we believe
   that changes in the skeletal delta(13)C are not related to sexual
   reproduction or growth rate. Contrary to previous work we were unable to
   measure any significant differences in the skeletal delta(13)C between
   the fast growing tops of the coral and the slower growing sides.},

   This species inhabits hard-bottom ecosystems from the northwestern
   Atlantic to the Gulf of Mexico and withstands an annual temperature
   range of up to 20 degrees C. Additionally, A. poculata is facultatively
   symbiotic and co-occurs in both symbiotic ('brown') and aposymbiotic
   ('white') states. Here, brown and white A. poculata were collected from
   Virginia (VA) and Rhode Island (RI), USA, and exposed to heat (18-32
   degrees C) and cold (18-6 degrees C) stress, during which respiration of
   the coral host along with photosynthesis and photochemical efficiency
   (F-v/F-m) of Breviolum psygmophilum photosymbionts were measured.
   Thermal performance curves (TPCs) of respiration revealed a pattern of
   countergradient variation with RI corals exhibiting higher respiration
   rates overall, and specifically at 6, 15, 18, 22 and 26 degrees C.
   Additionally, thermal optimum (T-opt) analyses show a 3.8 degrees C
   (brown) and 6.9 degrees C (white) higher T-opt in the VA population,
   corresponding to the warmer in situ thermal environment in VA. In
   contrast to respiration, no origin effect was detected in photosynthesis
   rates or F-v/F-m, suggesting a possible host-only signature of
   adaptation. This study is the first to consider A. poculata's response
   to both heat and cold stress across symbiotic states and geography, and
   provides insight into the potential evolutionary mechanisms behind the
   success of this species along the East Coast of the USA.},

Title = {First biological measurements of deep-sea corals from the Red Sea},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {3},
Month = {OCT 3},
Abstract = {It is usually assumed that metabolic constraints restrict deep-sea
   corals to cold-water habitats, with `deep-sea' and `cold-water' corals
   often used as synonymous. Here we report on the first measurements of
   biological characters of deep-sea corals from the central Red Sea, where
   they occur at temperatures exceeding 20 degrees C in highly oligotrophic
   and oxygen-limited waters. Low respiration rates, low calcification
   rates, and minimized tissue cover indicate that a reduced metabolism is
   one of the key adaptations to prevailing environmental conditions. We
   investigated four sites and encountered six species of which at least
   two appear to be undescribed. One species is previously reported from
   the Red Sea but occurs in deep cold waters outside the Red Sea raising
   interesting questions about presumed environmental constraints for other
   deep-sea corals. Our findings suggest that the present understanding of
   deep-sea coral persistence and resilience needs to be revisited.},

Title = {Response characteristics of bacterial communities in multiple coral
   genera at the early stages of coral bleaching during El Nin tilde o},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {144},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Although coral bleaching caused by high temperatures has attracted great
   concern, the response of the coral microbiome to bleaching has not been
   thoroughly explored. In this study, bacterial communities from 26 genera
   of semi-bleached coral in the South China Sea were studied using
   high-throughput sequencing during El Nin similar to o. Principal
   coordinates analysis (PCoA) indicated that the effect of early bleaching
   exceeded the effect of coral species on the bacterial communities.
   Bleaching caused significant changes in coral bacterial communities.
   Burkholderiales, Caulobacterales, Pseudomonadales, Cytophagales,
   Oceanospirillales, and Rhodobacterales, were significantly enriched in
   bleaching coral, whereas Rhizobiales, Cyanobacteria, Microtrichales,
   Thermoa-naerobaculales, Lachnospirales, Rickettsiales, and
   Lactobacillales, decreased in abundance. Core bacterial OTUs
   (operational taxonomic units) showed that high temperatures facilitated
   potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as Alcaligenes, Escherichia,
   Acinetobacter, Staphylococcus, and Enterobacteriaceae to occupy core
   positions. Further bleaching resulted in a significant reduction of
   potential core probiotics in corals. This could increase the risk of
   corals contracting diseases and reduce their environmental adaptability.
   Network analysis indicated that the bacterial interactions in bleaching
   coral were more complex than unbleached coral. Bacteroidales,
   Bur-kholderiales, Caulobacterales, Lactobacillales and Rhizobiales were
   the main taxa that interacted with other bacteria in bleaching and
   unbleached corals. The presence of these dominant taxa resulted in an
   increase in chemoheterotrophy, hydrocarbon degradation, nitrogen
   respiration, and denitrification, which led to great changes in the
   coral microenvironment. This study comprehensively revealed the response
   mechanism of coral bacteria during the bleaching process.},

Title = {The interacting effects of photosynthesis, calcification and water
   circulation on carbon chemistry variability on a coral reef flat: A
   modelling study},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {284},
Pages = {19-34},
Month = {JUL 24},
Abstract = {The diurnal fluctuations in seawater carbon chemistry that occur at
   sites within a coral reef system are due to water circulation, air-sea
   heat and gas exchange, and biogeochemical processes. The daily changes
   in dissolved carbon ion speciation and pH(T) on reefs can be larger than
   the century-scale shifts predicted for open ocean waters under climate
   change scenarios. We implement a 167 m resolution 3D hydrodynamic model
   of a coral reef (Heron Island reef, southern Great Barrier Reef,
   Australia) and couple it to a carbon biogeochemistry model. The model is
   forced by benthic fluxes calculated using a detailed habitat map and
   light and habitat-dependent parameterisations of
   calcification/photosynthesis developed from flume studies on Heron
   Island. During a two month simulation the model is able to reproduce the
   observed variability in the water temperature at 8 locations within the
   reef, demonstrating an ability of the model to capture the circulation.
   The simulation shows that the dominant processes driving the variability
   in carbonate chemistry at a location on the reef are the location of the
   different benthic communities and the path the water has taken to arrive
   at that location. A spatially-resolved age tracer indicates that the
   residence time of water over the reef varied between 16 and 60 h,
   depending on tides, winds and location. The longer transit times over
   the reef reduced the aragonite saturation state, Omega(a), in the
   overlying water to as low as 2. In the model simulation, the reef
   ecosystem reduces Omega(a) at a rate of 0.018 per hour on the reef. A
   scenario in which we removed the non-calcifying benthic microalgae from
   the reef showed a reduction in the Omega(a) in some regions from 5 to
   2.5, and an average reduction of the coral calcification by 15\%. This
   demonstrates the importance of processes that can alter the
   photosynthesis/respiration and calcification/dissolution balance when
   considering climate change impacts due to ocean acidification on corals
   at the reef scale. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Genetic changes involving the coral gastrovascular system support the

   Pocillopora acuta transcriptome},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 26},
Abstract = {Background A coral colony is composed of physiologically integrated
   polyps. In stony corals, coloniality adopts a wide diversity of forms
   and involves complex ontogenetic dynamics. However, molecular mechanisms
   underlying coloniality have been little studied. To understand the
   genetic basis of coloniality and its contribution to coral ecology, we
   induced polyp bail-out in a colonial coral, Pocillopora acuta, and
   compared transcription profiles of bailed-out polyps and polyps in
   normal colonies, and their responses to heat shock and hyposalinity.
   Results Consistent with morphological formation of a gastrovascular
   system and its neural transmission and molecular transport functions, we
   found genetic activation of neurogenesis and development of tube-like
   structures in normal colonies that is absent in bailed-out polyps.
   Moreover, relative to bailed-out polyps, colonies showed significant
   overexpression of genes for angiotensin-converting enzymes and
   endothelin-converting enzymes. In response to hyperthermal and
   hyposaline treatments, a high proportion of genetic regulation proved
   specific to either bailed-out polyps or colonies. Elevated temperatures
   even activated NF-kappa B signaling in colonies. On the other hand,
   colonies showed no discernible advantage over bailed-out polyps in
   regard to hyposalinity. Conclusions The present study provides a first
   look at the genetic basis of coloniality and documents different
   responses to environmental stimuli in P. acuta colonies versus those in
   bailed-out polyps. Overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzymes and
   endothelin-converting enzymes in colonies suggests possible involvement
   of these genes in development of the gastrovascular system in P. acuta.
   Functional characterization of these coral genes and further
   investigation of other forms of the transition to coloniality in stony
   corals should be fruitful areas for future research.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {211},
Number = {13},
Pages = {2185-2190},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Oxygen consumption of the Red Sea coral reef sponge Negombata magnifica
   was measured using both incubation and steady-state methods. The latter
   method was found to be the more reliable because sponge activity
   remained stable over time. Oxygen consumption rate was measured during
   three levels of sponge activity: full activity, reduced activity and
   basal activity (starved). It was found that the active oxygen
   consumption rate of N. magnifica averaged 37.3 +/- 4.6 nmol O-2 min(-1)
   g(-1) wet mass, which is within the upper range reported for other
   tropical marine sponges. Fully active N. magnifica individuals consumed
   an average of 41.8 +/- 3.2 nmol O-2 min(-1) g(-1) wet mass. The mean
   basal respiration rate was 20.2 +/- 1.2 nmol O-2 min(-1) g(-1) wet mass,
   which is 51.6 +/- 2.5\% of the active respiration rate. Therefore, the
   oxygen used for water pumping was calculated to be at most 10.6 +/- 1.8
   nmol O-2 min(-1) g(-1) wet mass, which is 25.1 +/- 3.6\% of the total
   respiration. Combined oxygen used for maintenance and water pumping
   activity was calculated to be 30.8 nmol O-2 min(-1) g(-1) wet mass,
   which is approximately 74\% of the sponge's total oxygen requirement.
   The remaining oxygen is directed to other physiological activities,
   mainly the energy requirement of growth. These findings suggest that
   only a relatively minor amount of energy is potentially available for
   growth, and thus might be a factor in controlling the growth rate of N.

Journal = {JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART A-CURRENT ISSUES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {80},
Number = {5},
Pages = {266-284},
Abstract = {Despite the importance of the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa to
   deep-sea reef ecosystem functioning, current knowledge of key
   physiological responses to available food resources is scarce. Scenarios
   with varying food density may help to understand how corals deal with
   seasonal variations in the dark ocean and might be used to study
   consequences of anthropogenic activities potentially affecting food
   availability. Thus, the physiological responses of L. pertusa to varying
   food (Artemia salina nauplii) concentration, ranging from 20\% to 300\%
   of carbon equivalent turned over by basal coral respiration, were
   investigated. A starvation group was also included. Measurements of
   respiration, growth, mucus production, and energy reserves (storage
   fatty acids) were performed at several time intervals over 26 weeks. In
   general, data showed a stronger effect of experimental time on measured
   responses, but no significant influence of food density treatment. In
   starved corals, respiration rate declined to 52\% of initial
   respiration, while skeleton growth rate was maintained at the same rate
   as Artemia-fed corals throughout the investigation. Mucus production
   measured as the sum of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate
   organic carbon (POC) was also similar across food treatments, but POC
   production exceeded that of DOC at the highest food density. No marked
   effect was observed on storage fatty acids. These results confirm that
   L. pertusa is highly resilient to environmental conditions with
   suboptimal food densities over a time scale of months. Regulation of
   several physiological processes, including respiration and mucus
   production, possibly in combination with an opportunistic feeding
   strategy, contributed to this tolerance to maintain viable corals. Thus,
   it appears that L. pertusa is well adapted to life in the deep sea.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a self-contained diver-portable instrument designed
   to non-destructively measure coral respiration and photosynthesis in
   situ. In situ instruments are needed to promote rapid assessment and
   monitoring of metabolic health of corals and other benthic organisms
   affected by ocean acidification, global warming, and other stressors,
   both anthropogenic and natural. Non-destructive tools are especially
   needed for reef corals because their live cover is greatly reduced and
   destructive sampling in many locations is prohibited. University of
   North Carolina Wilmington and Physical Sciences Inc., under the auspices
   of the NOAA-funded Cooperative Institute for Ocean Exploration, Research
   and Technology, have designed, fabricated and field tested such an
   instrument. CISME (Coral in Situ Metabolism and Energetics) is a compact
   instrument that measures dissolved oxygen, pH and temperature, which can
   then be used to determine respiration and photosynthesis rates of corals
   and a variety of other marine organisms. CISME has a sample port for
   introducing reagents (e. g. CO2 enriched seawater) or withdrawing water
   samples for analyses that require laboratory instrumentation (e. g.
   total alkalinity for calcification rates). The instrument has a broad
   spectrum light array capable of mimicking natural light intensities
   during photosynthetic measurements. Laboratory and field tests
   demonstrate that the instrument produces quick, consistent metabolic
   measurements, as well as photosynthesis vs. irradiance response curves.
   These features make CISME suitable for experiments with pollutants and
   for ocean acidification research. The new technology will provide a new
   field tool for assessing coral reef ecosystem health.},

Abstract = {Given the threats of greenhouse gas emissions and a changing climate to
   marine ecosystems, there is an urgent need to better understand the
   response of not only adult corals, which are particularly sensitive to
   environmental changes, but also their larvae, whose mechanisms of
   acclimation to both temperature increases and ocean acidification are
   not well understood. Brooded larvae from the reef coral Pocillopora
   damicornis collected from Nanwan Bay, Southern Taiwan, were exposed to
   ambient or elevated temperature (25 or 29 A degrees C) and pCO(2) (415
   or 635 mu atm) in a factorial experiment for 9 days, and a variety of
   physiological and molecular parameters were measured. Respiration and
   rubisco protein expression decreased in larvae exposed to elevated
   temperature, while those incubated at high pCO(2) were larger in size.
   Collectively, these findings highlight the complex metabolic and
   molecular responses of this life history stage and the need to integrate
   our understanding across multiple levels of biological organization. Our
   results also suggest that for this pocilloporid larval life stage, the
   impacts of elevated temperature are likely a greater threat under

Abstract = {The submarine canyons of the Brittany continental slope (Bay of
   Biscay-Northeast Atlantic) were studied to describe the conditions in
   which cold-water corals occur in these areas and their consequences for
   coral metabolism. Near-bottom current, oxygen, temperature, and particle
   flux, simultaneously measured for 2 yr at 850 m depth, revealed by
   spectral analysis the presence of several frequencies with a dominant
   semidiurnal tidal cycle and a current direction determined exclusively
   by the canyon topography. Sediment trap data also showed a seasonal
   input of material with a large peak of particles and carbon fluxes at
   the end of winter. Daily particle and carbon fluxes at 20 m above the
   bottom were 2.49 g m(-2) d(-1) and 20 mg C m(-2) d(-1), respectively. At
   the same area, in situ incubation of two cold-water coral species,
   Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata, using the Calmar benthic chamber
   indicated a coral oxygen consumption rate of 7.3 mu mol O-2 dry weight
   g(-1) d(-1), and a production rate of Sigma CO2 and NH4+ equal to 7.6 mu
   mol CO2 g(-1) d(-1) and 0.18 mu mol NH4+ g(-1) d(-1), respectively. The
   respiratory coefficient was equal to 1, indicating an omnivore food
   source. This conclusion was also confirmed by the : N index. The coral
   energy requirement was equal to 2.1 mmol C m(-2) d(-1). Comparison
   between carbon input in terms of particle flux and carbon oxidation rate
   by corals indicates that the energy supply to the bottom seems not
   sufficient to sustain the development and growth of cold-water coral all
   year in the Brittany canyons. However, coral necessarily require another
   source of energy such as zooplankton, particularly in summer and autumn
   when particle flux is reduced. Overall, the presence of abundant
   cold-water coral in the Brittany submarine canyons indicates that this
   location is ideal for their development given appropriate hydrological
   condition, favorable hard substrate, and also food availability.},

Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {691-701},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Reef-building corals are nutritionally dependent on the symbiotic alga
   Symbiodinium and may therefore select for high-performing symbiont
   lineages. However, the effects of fine-scale genetic variation within
   symbiont populations on host performance are not well understood.
   Applying quantitative PCR (qPCR) to Pocillopora damicornis colonies from
   Lord Howe Island (Australia), we estimated the relative abundance of
   intra-genomically variable (IGV) Symbiodinium cells and those with
   homogeneous rDNA sequence repeats. We then analysed their physical
   status and photosynthetic performance at both ambient and extreme summer
   temperatures (25 and 29 degrees C, respectively) in a closed-system
   oxygen flux chamber. The proportion of IGV Symbiodinium was negatively
   correlated with photosynthetic production and efficiency, and under
   thermal stress, colonies dominated by IGV cells could only meet
   respiratory demands at high irradiance (> 250 mu mol photons m(-2)
   s(-1)). IGV Symbiodinium were also estimated to be 50\% larger by
   volume, occurred at lower density, and had higher chlorophyll c(2)/a
   ratios. The comparatively poor performance of heterogeneous Symbiodinium
   cells suggests either a direct deleterious effect of IGV or reduced
   performance in putative inter-lineage recombinants, whose genomes
   feature ITS2 variants from both parental ribotypes. While it remains
   unclear whether the mixed rDNA arrays result from somatic mutation or
   recombination, our results demonstrate that the beneficial capacity of
   symbionts can vary within Symbiodinium populations, with potential
   implications for host fitness.},

Title = {Comparative thermal performance of the reef-building coral Orbicella
   franksi at its latitudinal range limits},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {166},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Temperature drives biological responses that scale from the cellular to
   ecosystem levels and thermal sensitivity will shape organismal functions
   and population dynamics as the world warms. Reef-building corals are
   sensitive to temperature due to their endosymbiotic relationship with
   single-celled dinoflagellates, with mass mortality events increasing in
   frequency and magnitude. The purpose of this study was to quantify the
   thermal sensitivity of important physiological functions of a Caribbean
   reef-building coral, Orbicella franksi, through the measurement of
   thermal performance curves (TPCs). We compared TPC metrics (thermal
   optimum, critical maximum, activation energy, deactivation energy, and
   rate at a standardized temperature) between two populations at the
   northern and southern extents of the geographic range of O. franksi. We
   further compared essential coral organismal processes (gross
   photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification) within a site to
   determine which function is most sensitive to thermal stress using a
   hierarchical Bayesian-modeling approach. We found evidence for
   differences in thermal performance, which could be due to thermal
   adaptation or acclimatization, with higher TPC metrics (thermal optimum
   and critical maximum) in warmer Panama, compared to cooler Bermuda. We
   also documented the hierarchy in thermal sensitivity of essential
   organismal functions within a population: respiration was less sensitive
   than photosynthesis, which was less sensitive than calcification.
   Understanding thermal performance of corals is essential for projecting
   coral reef futures, given that key biological functions necessary to
   sustain coral reef ecosystems are thermally mediated.},

Title = {High light alongside elevated P-CO(2) alleviates thermal depression of
   photosynthesis in a hard coral (Pocillopora acuta)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {223},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The absorbtion of human-emitted CO2 by the oceans (elevated P-CO2) is
   projected to alter the physiological performance of coral reef organisms
   by perturbing seawater chemistry (i.e. ocean acidification).
   Simultaneously, greenhouse gas emissions are driving ocean warming and
   changes in irradiance (through turbidity and cloud cover), which have
   the potential to influence the effects of ocean acidification on coral
   reefs. Here, we explored whether physiological impacts of elevated
   P-CO2, on a coral-algal symbiosis (Pocillopora acuta-Symbiodiniaceae)
   are mediated by light and/or temperature levels. In a 39 day experiment,
   elevated P-CO2 (962 versus 431 patm P-CO2) had an interactive effect
   with midday light availability (400 versus 800 pmol photons m(-2) s(-1))
   and temperature (25 versus 29 degrees C) on areal gross and net
   photosynthesis, for which a decline at 29 degrees C was ameliorated
   under simultaneous high-Pm and high-light conditions. Light-enhanced
   dark respiration increased under elevated P-CO2 and/or elevated
   temperature. Symbiont to host cell ratio and chlorophyll a per symbiont
   increased at elevated temperature, whilst symbiont areal density
   decreased. The ability of moderately strong light in the presence of
   elevated P-CO2 to alleviate the temperature-induced decrease in
   photosynthesis suggests that higher substrate availability facilitates a
   greater ability for photochemical quenching, partially offsetting the
   impacts of high temperature on the photosynthetic apparatus. Future
   environmental changes that result in moderate increases in light levels
   could therefore assist the P. acuta holobiont to cope with the `one-two
   punch' of rising temperatures in the presence of an acidifying ocean.},

   determined by their resilience to cold bleaching},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Month = {DEC 18},
Abstract = {The distribution of corals in Japan covers a wide range of latitudes,
   encompassing tropical to temperate zones. However, coral communities in
   temperate zones contain only a small subset of species. Among the
   parameters that determine the distribution of corals, temperature plays
   an important role. We tested the resilience to cold stress of three
   coral species belonging to the genus Acropora in incubation experiments.
   Acropora pruinosa, which is the northernmost of the three species,
   bleached at 13 degrees C, but recovered once temperatures were
   increased. The two other species, A. hyacinthus and A. solitaryensis,
   which has a more southerly range than A. pruinosa, died rapidly after
   bleaching at 13 degrees C. The physiological effects of cold bleaching
   on the corals included decreased rates of photosynthesis, respiration,
   and calcification, similar to the physiological effects observed with
   bleaching due to high temperature stress. Contrasting hot bleaching, no
   increases in antioxidant enzyme activities were observed, suggesting
   that reactive oxygen species play a less important role in bleaching
   under cold stress. These results confirmed the importance of resilience
   to cold stress in determining the distribution and northern limits of
   coral species, as cold events causing coral bleaching and high mortality
   occur regularly in temperate zones.},

Abstract = {Warming and changes in ocean carbonate chemistry alter marine coastal
   ecosystems at an accelerating pace. The interaction between these
   stressors has been the subject of recent studies on reef organisms such
   as corals, bryozoa, molluscs, and crustose coralline algae. Here we
   investigated the combined effects of elevated sea surface temperatures
   and pCO(2) on two species of photosymbiont-bearing coral reef
   Foraminifera: Heterostegina depressa (hosting diatoms) and Marginopora
   vertebralis (hosting dinoflagellates). The effects of single and
   combined stressors were studied by monitoring survivorship, growth, and
   physiological parameters, such as respiration, photochemistry (pulse
   amplitude modulation fluorometry and oxygen production), and chl a
   content. Specimens were exposed in flow-through aquaria for up to seven
   weeks to combinations of two pCO(2) (similar to 790 and similar to 490 A
   mu atm) and two temperature (28 and 31 A degrees C) regimes. Elevated
   temperature had negative effects on the physiology of both species.
   Elevated pCO(2) had negative effects on growth and apparent
   photosynthetic rate in H.depressa but a positive effect on effective
   quantum yield. With increasing pCO(2), chl a content decreased in H.
   depressa and increased in M. vertebralis. The strongest stress responses
   were observed when the two stressors acted in combination. An
   interaction term was statistically significant in half of the measured
   parameters. Further exploration revealed that 75 \% of these cases
   showed a synergistic (= larger than additive) interaction between the
   two stressors. These results indicate that negative physiological
   effects on photosymbiont-bearing coral reef Foraminifera are likely to
   be stronger under simultaneous acidification and temperature rise than
   what would be expected from the effect of each of the stressors
   individually.},

Abstract = {Bleaching of reef corals, involving loss of symbiotic algae (=
   zooxanthellae), loss of algal pigments, or both, has been linked to
   temperature stress. In this study the effects of high temperature and
   light on zooxanthellae living in the Caribbean reef corals Montastrea
   annularis, M. cavernosa, Agaricia agaricites, and A. lamarcki were
   studied. Pieces of coral colonies were incubated at ambient seawater
   temperature (26 degrees + 1 degrees), and at 30 degrees, 32 degrees, and
   34 degrees C. Symbiotic algae from M. annularis, a species of coral from
   the forereef that commonly bleaches, showed the following sequence of
   events when exposed to natural light at 32 degrees C: loss of
   photosynthetic potential measured as fluorescence yield, corresponding
   reduction of both oxygen production per zooxanthella and P:R
   (photosynthesis:respiration) ratio, and subsequent reduction in density
   of algae in relation to surface area of the coral. These parameters were
   not signifcantly reduced and no deaths occurred for M. annularis or any
   other coral species maintained at 26 degrees or 30 degrees C. However,
   the sequence of events was condensed to less than 24 h when M. annularis
   was subjected to 34 degrees C seawater, except that there was little if
   any reduction in algal density before tissue-sloughing and death
   occurred between 10 and 24 h. Loss of significant amounts of chlorophyll
   a per alga was not evident for any corals except those maintained at 34
   degrees C longer than 10 h. In contrast, symbiotic algae in M.
   cavernosa, a species that rarely bleaches in nature, showed only slight
   reductions in photosynthesis and fluorescence yield, and no significant
   loss of algal cells or chlorophyll a, when maintained in seawater at 32
   degrees C for 2 days. Thus zooxanthellae in M. cavernosa appeared to be
   less affected by sublethal high-temperature stress. Similar contrasting
   patterns of bleaching were seen in zooxanthellae from the plating coral
   Agaricia lamarcki, which often bleaches during the late summer and fall,
   compared with zooxanthellae from A. agaricites, a coral which bleaches
   less frequently. In addition, M. annularis exposed to sublethal high
   temperatures and ambient light bleached faster than those kept in dimmer
   light, supporting past field observations suggesting that light energy
   is an important component of bleaching in nature. When M. annularis was
   exposed to different wavelengths of natural light at 32 degrees C, the
   fluorescence yield declined more quickly in the presence of higher
   energy UV-A and blue light than with other photosynthetically active
   radiation. Natural levels of UV-B had little effect in this study. These
   data suggest that the patterns of bleaching seen in nature may be at
   least partially explained by different tolerances of the symbiotic algae
   in the corals, and that light plays a significant role in bleaching.},

   year 2100 AD},
Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {7},

Pages = {289-300},
Abstract = {Atmospheric CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) is expected to increase to 700
   mu atm or more by the end of the present century. Anthropogenic CO2 is
   absorbed by the oceans, leading to decreases in pH and the CaCO3
   saturation state (Omega) of the seawater. Elevated pCO(2) was shown to
   drastically decrease calcification rates in tropical zooxanthellate
   corals. Here we show, using the Mediterranean zooxanthellate coral
   Cladocora caespitosa, that an increase in pCO(2), in the range predicted
   for 2100, does not reduce its calcification rate. Therefore, the
   conventional belief that calcification rates will be affected by ocean
   acidification may not be widespread in temperate corals. Seasonal change
   in temperature is the predominant factor controlling photosynthesis,
   respiration, calcification and symbiont density. An increase in pCO(2),
   alone or in combination with elevated temperature, had no significant
   effect on photosynthesis, photosynthetic efficiency and calcification.
   The lack of sensitivity C. caespitosa to elevated pCO(2) might be due to
   its slow growth rates, which seem to be more dependent on temperature
   than on the saturation state of calcium carbonate in the range projected
   for the end of the century.},

   Reefs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {125},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Time series from open ocean fixed stations have robustly documented
   secular changes in carbonate chemistry and long-term ocean acidification
   (OA) trends as a direct response to increases in atmospheric carbon
   dioxide (CO2). However, few high-frequency coastal carbon time series
   are available in reef systems, where most affected tropical marine
   organisms reside. Seasonal variations in carbonate chemistry at Cheeca
   Rocks (CR), Florida, and La Parguera (LP), Puerto Rico, are presented
   based on 8 and 10 years of continuous, high-quality measurements,
   respectively. We synthesized and modeled carbonate chemistry to
   understand how physical and biological processes affect seasonal
   carbonate chemistry at both locations. The results showed that
   differences in biology and thermodynamic cycles between the two systems
   caused higher amplitudes at CR despite the shorter residence times
   relative to LP. Analyses based on oxygen and temperature-normalized
   pCO(2sw) showed that temperature effects on pCO(2sw) at CR were largely
   counteracted by primary productivity, while thermodynamics alone
   explained a majority of the pCO(2sw) dynamics at LP. Heterotrophy
   dominated from late spring to fall, and autotrophy dominated from winter
   to early spring. Observations suggested that organic respiration
   decreased the carbonate mineral saturation state (Omega) during late
   summer/fall. The interactive effects between the inorganic and organic
   carbon cycles and the assumed effects of benthic metabolism on the water
   chemistry at both sites appeared to cause seasonal hysteresis with the
   carbonate chemistry. Improved integration of observational data to
   modeling approaches will help better forecast how physical and
   biogeochemical processes will affect Omega and carbonate chemistry in
   coastal areas.
   Plain Language Summary Anthropogenic activities, such as the burning of
   fossil fuels, interact with the chemistry of the ocean surface and cause
   ocean acidification (OA). The current trend and projections for OA are
   well defined for open ocean waters, although less is known about its
   effects on nearshore ecosystems, where most of the affected organisms
   reside. In this work, we analyzed almost a decade of carbonate chemistry
   data for two reef time series at Cheeca Rocks (CR), Florida, and La
   Parguera (LP), Puerto Rico, to assess the physical and biological
   processes that dictate carbonate seasonal variability. The results
   showed that temperature is the dominant driver of seawater CO2 changes
   at LP, while at CR, biological processes have major effects on CO2
   chemistry. Continued observations will advance future projections of OA
   in nearshore areas and provide coastal managers with appropriate tools
   to monitor OA.},

   Aposymbiotic Corals},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 27},
Abstract = {The unique mutualism between corals and their photosynthetic
   zooxanthellae (Symbiodinium spp.) is the driving force behind functional
   assemblages of coral reefs. However, the respective roles of hosts and
   Symbiodinium in this endosymbiotic association, particularly in response
   to environmental challenges (e.g., high sea surface temperatures),
   remain unsettled. One of the key obstacles is to produce and maintain
   aposymbiotic coral hosts for experimental purposes. In this study, a
   simple and gentle protocol to generate aposymbiotic coral hosts (Isopora
   palifera and Stylophora pistillata) was developed using repeated
   incubation in menthol/artificial seawater (ASW) medium under light and
   in ASW in darkness, which depleted more than 99\% of Symbiodinium from
   the host within 4,8 days. As indicated by the respiration rate, energy
   metabolism (by malate dehydrogenase activity), and nitrogen metabolism
   (by glutamate dehydrogenase activity and profiles of free amino acids),
   the physiological and biochemical performances of the menthol-induced
   aposymbiotic corals were comparable to their symbiotic counterparts
   without nutrient supplementation (e.g., for Stylophora) or with a
   nutrient supplement containing glycerol, vitamins, and a host mimic of
   free amino acid mixture (e.g., for Isopora). Differences in biochemical
   responses to menthol-induced bleaching between Stylophora and Isopora
   were attributed to the former digesting Symbiodinium rather than
   expelling the algae live as found in the latter species. Our studies
   showed that menthol could successfully bleach corals and provided
   aposymbiotic corals for further exploration of coral-alga symbioses.},

Abstract = {Skeletal isotopic and metabolic measurements of the branching coral
   Acropora cultured in constant conditions and subjected to two light
   intensities were revisited. We individually compared the data recorded
   at low light (LL) and high light (HL) for 24 colonies, all derived from
   the same parent colony. Metabolic and isotopic responses to the
   different light levels were highly variable. High light led to
   productivity enhancement, reduction of surface extension, doubling of
   aragonite deposited weight and increased delta O-18 levels in all
   nubbins; responses in respiration and delta C-13 were not clear. The
   partitioning of the colonies cultured at HL into two groups, one showing
   a delta C-13 enrichment and the other a delta C-13 decrease revealed
   common behaviors. Samples showing an increase in delta C-13 were
   associated with the co-variation of low surface extension and high
   productivity while samples showing a decrease in delta C-13 were
   associated with the co-variation of higher surface extension and limited
   productivity.
   This experiment, which allowed for the separation of temperature and
   light effects on the coral, highlighted the significant light influences
   on both skeletal delta O-18 and delta C-13. The high scattering of
   inter-colony delta O-18 observed at one site could be due to the
   differing photosynthetic responses of symbiotic algal assemblages.
   We compared our results with observations by Gladfelter on Acropora
   cervicornis (1982). Both set of results highlight the relationships
   between coral-growth rates, micro-structures and photosynthetic
   activity. It appears that extension growth and skeleton thickening are
   two separate growth modes, and thickening is light-enhanced while
   extension is light-suppressed. There are multiple consequences of these
   findings for paleoclimatic reconstructions involving corals.},

Abstract = {In many cases, understanding species' responses to climate change
   requires understanding variation among individuals in response to such
   change. For species with strong symbiotic relationships, such as many
   coral reef species, genetic variation in symbiont responses to
   temperature may affect the response to increased ocean temperatures. To
   assess variation among symbiont genotypes, we examined the population
   dynamics and physiological responses of genotypes of Breviolum
   antillogorgium in response to increased temperature. We found broad
   temperature tolerance across genotypes, with all genotypes showing
   positive growth at 26, 30, and 32 degrees C. Genotypes differed in the
   magnitude of the response of growth rate and carrying capacity to
   increasing temperature, suggesting that natural selection could favor
   different genotypes at different temperatures. However, the historical
   temperature at which genotypes were reared (26 or 30 degrees C) was not
   a good predictor of contemporary temperature response. We found
   increased photosynthetic rates and decreased respiration rates with
   increasing contemporary temperature, and differences in physiology among
   genotypes, but found no significant differences in the response of these
   traits to temperature among genotypes. In species with such broad
   thermal tolerance, selection experiments on symbionts outside of the
   host may not yield results sufficient for evolutionary rescue from
   climate change.},

Title = {Reef-building corals thrive within hot-acidified and deoxygenated waters},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {Coral reefs are deteriorating under climate change as oceans continue to
   warm and acidify and thermal anomalies grow in frequency and intensity.
   In vitro experiments are widely used to forecast reef-building coral
   health into the future, but often fail to account for the complex
   ecological and biogeochemical interactions that govern reefs.
   Consequently, observations from coral communities under naturally
   occurring extremes have become central for improved predictions of
   future reef form and function. Here, we present a semi-enclosed lagoon
   system in New Caledonia characterised by diel fluctuations of
   hot-deoxygenated water coupled with tidally driven persistently low pH,
   relative to neighbouring reefs. Coral communities within the lagoon
   system exhibited high richness (number of species = 20) and cover
   (24-35\% across lagoon sites). Calcification rates for key species
   (Acropora formosa, Acropora pulchra, Coelastrea aspera and Porites
   lutea) for populations from the lagoon were equivalent to, or reduced by
   ca. 30-40\% compared to those from the reef. Enhanced coral respiration,
   alongside high particulate organic content of the lagoon sediment,
   suggests acclimatisation to this trio of temperature, oxygen and pH
   changes through heterotrophic plasticity. This semi-enclosed lagoon
   therefore provides a novel system to understand coral acclimatisation to
   complex climatic scenarios and may serve as a reservoir of coral
   populations already resistant to extreme environmental conditions.},

Abstract = {Video observations of the seafloor show that cup corals, Flabellum spp.
   are common and locally abundant on the continental slope off Nova
   Scotia. Flabellum alabstrum Moseley, 1876 was the most common with an
   average abundance, when present of 1.1 individual per square meter.
   Flabellum macandrewi Gray, 1849 was often encountered in clusters of up
   to seven individuals close enough for tentacles to interact. Occurrence
   of live fragments in the field may indicate fisheries impact or that
   fragmentation represents an asexual reproduction mode. Live specimens of
   E alabastrum were collected with a remotely operated vehicle and
   videograb, and studied in laboratory for 21 mo. The corals were kept in
   a tank and aquarium with stable temperature and salinity. Observations
   were made on patterns of polyp expansion/contraction, movement, feeding
   behavior, and survival and regeneration of coral fragments. Large
   (0.1-1.5 cm) pieces of dead krill (Euphausiacea) were handled with a
   relatively rapid withdrawal of the tentacles, whereas smaller (< 1 mm)
   particles were transferred to the mouth by ``licking{''} upper and lower
   sets of tentacles separately at a slower pace. The coral has the ability
   to rapidly expand the polyp volume more than ten times its normal size.
   This behavior may be related to food uptake, excretion/exchange of
   metabolites, and respiration, but may also represent a way to facilitate
   movement along the bottom by means of increased buoyancy and drag.
   Expanded individuals were also observed in the field. In aquarium, F,
   alabastrum was observed moving slowly (up to 3.2 cm mo(-1)), leaving
   tracks in the sediment, but the mechanism for this is not understood.
   Respiration of F. alabastrum was measured on selected individuals as
   oxygen consumption in closed chambers, and rates varied between 1.61-3.2
   O(2)mu l g(-1)WWh(-1) for individual corals. The turnover time was
   estimated to 5.5 yrs with a production of 0.09 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in areas
   with an average abundance of the coral.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Scleractinian coral populations are declining worldwide in response to a
   variety of factors including increases in sea surface temperatures. To
   evaluate the effects of predicted elevated seawater temperatures on
   coral recruitment, larvae from the coral Porites astreoides were exposed
   to seawater at ambient (27.3 A degrees C) or elevated temperature (30.8
   A degrees C) conditions for 4, 24, or 48 h. Following exposure, larvae
   were tested for survival and settlement, oxidative stress, respiratory
   demand, and mRNA expression of heat-shock proteins (Hsps) 16 and 60.
   While elevated temperature had no effect on larval survival, settlement,
   or expression of Hsps, it did cause a significant increase in larval
   respiration, oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation), and antioxidant
   enzyme activity (catalase). The absence of a significant up-regulation
   of Hsp 16 or 60 expression in response to thermal stress suggests that
   the transcriptional expression of these genes is a less sensitive
   diagnostic tool compared to biomarkers of oxidative stress at the
   temperatures examined. The results of this study provide evidence that
   enhanced levels of oxidative stress are encountered in
   zooxanthellae-containing coral larvae in response to elevated
   temperatures and that this occurrence should be strongly considered for
   use as a biomarker when monitoring sub-lethal cellular responses to
   rising sea surface temperatures.},

Title = {High salinity tolerance of the Red Sea coral Fungia granulosa under
   desalination concentrate discharge conditions: an in situ
   photophysiology experiment},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {1},
Abstract = {Seawater reverse osmosis desalination concentrate may have chronic
   and/or acute impacts on the marine ecosystems in the near-field area of
   the discharge. Environmental impact of the desalination plant discharge
   is supposedly site- and volumetric- specific, and also depends on the
   salinity tolerance of the organisms inhabiting the water column in and
   around a discharge environment. Scientific studies that aim to
   understand possible impacts of elevated salinity levels are important to
   assess detrimental effects to organisms, especially for species with no
   mechanism of osmoregulation, e.g., presumably corals. Previous studies
   on corals indicate sensitivity toward hypo- and hyper-saline
   environments with small changes in salinity already affecting coral
   physiology. In order to evaluate sensitivity of Red Sea corals to
   increased salinity levels, we conducted a long-term (29 days) in situ
   salinity tolerance transect study at an offshore seawater reverse
   osmosis (SWRO) discharge on the coral Fungia granulosa. While we
   measured a pronounced increase in salinity and temperature at the direct
   outlet of the discharge structure, effects were indistinguishable from
   the surrounding environment at a distance of 5 m. Interestingly, corals
   were not affected by varying salinity levels as indicated by
   measurements of the photosynthetic efficiency. Similarly, cultured coral
   symbionts of the genus Symbiodinium displayed remarkable tolerance
   levels in regard to hypo- and hypersaline treatments. Our data suggest
   that increased salinity and temperature levels from discharge outlets
   wear off quickly in the surrounding environment. Furthermore, F.
   granulosa seem to tolerate levels of salinity that are distinctively
   higher than reported for other corals previously. It remains to be
   determined whether Red Sea corals in general display increased salinity
   tolerance, and whether this is related to prevailing levels of high(er)
   salinity in the Red Sea in comparison to other oceans.},

Abstract = {Florida red tides, caused by the dinoflagellate Karenia brevis, produce
   a series of neurotoxins, brevetoxins, which have historically had a
   negative impact on coastal communities along the South Florida coast.
   While much work has examined the effects of K. brevis blooms or exposure
   to brevetoxins on a diverse array of marine organisms, there have been
   no reports studying the impact of K. brevis on coral physiology. We
   provide evidence that short-term exposure of naturally occurring
   concentrations of K. brevis and their associated toxins can induce
   oxidative stress in the coral larvae of Porites astreoides. Larvae of A
   astreoides were exposed to aliquots of intact K. brevis cells at
   naturally occurring concentrations (6 x 10(5) - 4 x 10(6) cells L-1) or
   cellular lysates (containing 5.4-15.0 mu g L-1 brevetoxin) for 20 h and
   a variety of larval physiological biomarkers were measured. in the
   presence of bloom scale concentrations of K. brevis larval respiration
   of A astreoides was inhibited. This was accompanied with an increase in
   lipid hydroperoxide content and catalase activity indicating oxidative
   damage and a subsequent antioxidant response were occurring. However,
   when larvae were exposed to intact cells of K. brevis or their
   sonicated, lysed exudates stress indices including zooxanthellae
   expulsion (bleaching), larval protein carbonylation, and superoxide
   dismutase activity were not significantly altered. Even though there was
   evidence for short-term oxidative stress in larvae that were exposed to
   K. brevis there was no change in survival or settlement rates of larvae
   of P. astrecrides. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   potential to warming},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {Global warming was reported to cause growth reductions in tropical
   shallow water corals in both, cooler and warmer, regions of the coral
   species range. This suggests regional adaptation with less heat-tolerant
   populations in cooler and more thermo-tolerant populations in warmer
   regions. Here, we investigated seasonal changes in the in situ metabolic
   performance of the widely distributed hermatypic coral Pocillopora
   verrucosa along 12 degrees latitudes featuring a steep temperature
   gradient between the northern (28.5 degrees N, 21-27 degrees C) and
   southern (16.5 degrees N, 28-33 degrees C) reaches of the Red Sea.
   Surprisingly, we found little indication for regional adaptation, but
   strong indications for high phenotypic plasticity: Calcification rates
   in two seasons (winter, summer) were found to be highest at 28-29
   degrees C throughout all populations independent of their geographic
   location. Mucus release increased with temperature and nutrient supply,
   both being highest in the south. Genetic characterization of the coral
   host revealed low inter-regional variation and differences in the
   Symbiodinium clade composition only at the most northern and most
   southern region. This suggests variable acclimatization potential to
   ocean warming of coral populations across the Red Sea: high
   acclimatization potential in northern populations, but limited ability
   to cope with ocean warming in southern populations already existing at
   the upper thermal margin for corals.},

Abstract = {In coral reefs, dissolved organic matter (DOM) cycling is a critical
   process for sustaining ecosystem functioning. However, global and local
   stressors have caused persistent shifts from coral- to algae-dominated
   benthic communities. The influence of such phase shifts on DOM nature
   and its utilization by heterotrophic bacterioplankton remains poorly
   studied. Every second month for one year, we retrieved seawater samples
   enriched in DOM produced by coral- and algae-dominated benthic
   communities in a central Red Sea reef during a full annual cycle.
   Seawater incubations were conducted in the laboratory under in situ
   temperature and light conditions by inoculating enriched DOM samples
   with bacterial assemblages collected in the surrounding waters.
   Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were higher in the warmer
   months (May-September) in both communities, resulting in higher specific
   growth rates and bacterial growth efficiencies (BGE). However, these
   high summer values were significantly enhanced in algal-DOM relative to
   coral-DOM, suggesting the potential for bacterioplankton biomass
   increase in reefs with algae replacing healthy coral cover under warmer
   conditions. The potential exacerbation of heterotrophic bacterial
   activity in the ongoing widespread regime shift from coral- to

Abstract = {Tropical reef-building coral stress levels will intensify with the
   predicted rising atmospheric CO2 resulting in ocean temperature and
   acidification increase. Most studies to date have focused on the
   destabilization of coral-dinoflagellate symbioses due to warming oceans,
   or declining calcification due to ocean acidification. In our study, pH
   and temperature conditions consistent with the end-of-century scenarios
   of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) caused major
   changes in photosynthesis and respiration, in addition to decreased
   calcification rates in the coral Acropora millepora. Population density
   of symbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium) under high levels of ocean
   acidification and temperature (Representative Concentration Pathway,
   RCP8.5) decreased to half of that found under present day conditions,
   with photosynthetic and respiratory rates also being reduced by 40\%.
   These physiological changes were accompanied by evidence for gene
   regulation of calcium and bicarbonate transporters along with components
   of the organic matrix. Meta-transcriptomic RNA-Seq data analyses showed
   an overall down regulation of metabolic transcripts, and an increased
   abundance of transcripts involved in circadian clock control,
   controlling the damage of oxidative stress, calcium
   signaling/homeostasis, cytoskeletal interactions, transcription
   regulation, DNA repair, Wnt signaling and apoptosis/immunity/toxins. We
   suggest that increased maintenance costs under ocean acidification and
   warming, and diversion of cellular ATP to pH homeostasis, oxidative
   stress response, UPR and DNA repair, along with metabolic suppression,
   may underpin why Acroporid species tend not to thrive under future
   environmental stress. Our study highlights the potential increased
   energy demand when the coral holobiont is exposed to high levels of

Abstract = {Changes in land use and water management practices in south Florida have
   altered the quality and quantity of freshwater flowing into Florida Bay.
   By the 1980s, reduced inflow and drought led to an extensive hypersaline
   phase in the bay. This phase had a drastic effect on benthic communities
   within the bay and possibly also on coral communities within the bay and
   the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Physical oceanographic
   measurements demonstrate the presence of warm, hypersaline, and turbid
   water on coral reefs offshore from the Florida Keys, especially near
   passes which conduct water from Florida Bay to the Atlantic Ocean.
   To examine the effect of Florida Bay water intrusions on coral reefs, we
   tested for significant effects of two stressors, elevated temperature
   and salinity, on coral production, respiration, and survival. Elevated
   temperatures produce significant reductions in photosynthesis,
   respiration, and net P:R ratios after 6 h of exposure, and elevated
   salinities produce similar results after 30 h. Exposure to both elevated
   temperature and salinity produces a highly significant (P > 0.01), but
   short-term, mitigative interactive effect. The combination of the two
   stressors was less stressful (for the response variables measured) than
   the sum of the stressors acting independently. After 36 h of exposure,
   however, the mitigating effect disappeared and corals exposed to the
   combined stresses did not survive. A three-dimensional response surface,
   which predicts P: R ratios as a function of varying salinity and
   temperature, is used to construct a testable hypothesis to explain
   recent declines in coral cover on some reefs within Florida Bay and the
   Florida Keys. We chose salinity and temperature to test a multiple
   stressor model because they are relatively easy to manipulate. However,
   any environmentally realistic model must include other potential
   stressors, such as turbidity, elevated nutrients, and environmental
   contaminants.},

Abstract = {Tissue biomass (ash-free dry weight) and symbiotic dinoflagellates
   (density, chlorophyll a cell(-1) or cm(-2) of coral surface area) of
   five species of reef-building corals were monitored seasonally for up to
   4 yr at three different depths in the Bahamas. The lowest values of all
   tissue biomass and algal symbiont parameters occurred during the late
   summer-fall sample periods. In contrast, the highest densities and
   pigment content of symbionts usually occurred during the winter, whereas
   tissue biomass peaked most often in the spring, the time lag implying a
   functional relationship between these variables. Corals living in
   shallow water often (but not always) had higher levels of all parameters
   measured compared to deeper corals, except chlorophyll a content, which
   usually displayed the opposite trend. The results show that corals from
   all depths exhibited bleaching (loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates and/or
   their pigments) every year, regardless of whether they appeared white,
   tan, or mottled to the human eye. We speculate that these patterns are
   driven by seasonal changes in light and temperature on algal and animal

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {31},

Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {{[} 1] Coral reefs are constructed of calcium carbonate (CaCO(3)).
   Deposition of CaCO(3) (calcification) by corals and other reef organisms
   is controlled by the saturation state of CaCO(3) in seawater (Omega) and
   sea surface temperature (SST). Previous studies have neglected the
   effects of ocean warming in predicting future coral reef calcification
   rates. In this study we take into account both these effects by
   combining empirical relationships between coral calcification rate and W
   and SST with output from a climate model to predict changes in coral
   reef calcification rates. Our analysis suggests that annual average
   coral reef calcification rate will increase with future ocean warming
   and eventually exceed pre-industrial rates by about 35\% by 2100. Our
   results suggest that present coral reef calcification rates are
   equivalent to levels in the late 19th century and does not support
   previous suggestions of large and potentially catastrophic decreases in
   the future.},

Abstract = {The community respiration of 2 tidally dominated cold-water coral (CWC)
   sites was estimated using the non-invasive eddy correlation (EC)
   technique. The first site, Mingulay Reef Complex, was a rock ridge
   located in the Sea of Hebrides off Scotland at a depth of 128 m and the
   second site, Stjernsund, was a channel-like sound in Northern Norway at
   a depth of 220 m. Both sites were characterized by the presence of live
   mounds of the reef framework-forming scleractinian Lophelia pertusa and
   reef-associated fauna such as sponges, crustaceans and other corals. The
   measured O-2 uptake at the 2 sites varied between 5 and 46 mmol m(-2)
   d(-1), mainly depending on the ambient flow characteristics. The average
   uptake rate estimated from the similar to 24 h long deployments amounted
   to 27.8 +/- 2.3 mmol m(-2) d(-1) at Mingulay and 24.8 +/- 2.6 mmol m(-2)
   d(-1) at Stjernsund (mean +/- SE). These rates are 4 to 5 times higher
   than the global mean for soft sediment communities at comparable depths.
   The measurements document the importance of CWC communities for local
   and regional carbon cycling and demonstrate that the EC technique is a
   valuable tool for assessing rates of benthic O2 uptake in such complex
   and dynamic settings.},

Abstract = {Some subtidal habitats may experience extremely large diel temperature
   fluctuations. To explore the potential of subtidal animals to regulate
   their metabolic processes, we investigated how the oxygen consumption
   rate (MO2) of the sea urchin Mesocentrotus nudus changes in response to
   extreme temperature fluctuations by mimicking temperature variations
   recorded at Dokdo Island, Republic of Korea. We compared the MO2 of
   urchins before and after a temperature fluctuation. MO2 was positively
   correlated with temperature. There was no change in the mean MO2 values
   even after exposure to fluctuating temperature. There was no significant
   difference in mean MO2 between large and small temperature fluctuations.
   These results indicate that the metabolic activity of M. nudus might be
   well-adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations. However, given that
   the temperature coefficient (Q(10)) values decreased with increasing
   temperature and Q(10) values during the temperature decrease was higher
   than those during temperature increase, temperature rise may still act
   as a stressor for these animals.},

Abstract = {Corals are relatively stenothermic organisms and highly sensitive to
   thermal stress. To understand how heating rate modulates the holobiont
   response to thermal challenge, we compared the effects of acute heat
   shock and cumulative thermal exposures on Acropora cervicornis from
   Southeast Florida (26 degrees 06 N, 80 degrees 05 W). In March of 2017,
   maximum dark-adapted yield of photosystem II (F-V/F-M), rates of dark
   respiration (R), and rates of gross photosynthesis (P-g) were measured
   at temperatures spanning 25-36 degrees C. Thermal performance curves of
   each response variable were constructed as a function of temperature and
   thermal dose (i.e., degree heating minutes). Acute exposure (i.e.,
   instantaneously increasing temperature by between 2.5 and 10 degrees C)
   resulted in a more marked decline in physiology despite a lower thermal
   dose, compared to the cumulative exposure (2.5 degrees C h(-1)).
   Apparent deficits in coral holobiont metabolism were observed as a
   function of both temperature and thermal dose, but examination of
   holobiont metabolism in a dose-context revealed more pronounced
   differences between acute and cumulative exposures. Subtle physiological
   differences may be more easily identified and better cross-study
   comparisons of cnidarian thermal tolerance may be achieved by placing
   temperature exposures in degree heating times. In addition, the ratio of
   daily P-g:R fell below 1 when temperatures exceeded 32 degrees C,
   corroborating prior observations that P-g:R may be a means of
   identifying physiological deficits in advance of visual signs of
   dysbiosis, such as bleaching.},

Abstract = {We tested the effects of pCO(2) on Seriatopora caliendrum recruits over
   the first 5.3 d of post-settlement existence. In March 2011, 11-20
   larvae were settled in glass vials (3.2 mL) and incubated at 24.0

Abstract = {As atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise, associated ocean warming (OW)
   and ocean acidification (OA) are predicted to cause declines in
   reef-building corals globally, shifting reefs from coral-dominated
   systems to those dominated by less sensitive species. Sponges are
   important structural and functional components of coral reef ecosystems,
   but despite increasing field-based evidence that sponges may be `
   winners' in response to environmental degradation, our understanding of
   how they respond to the combined effects of OW and OA is limited. To
   determine the tolerance of adult sponges to climate change, four
   abundant Great Barrier Reef species were experimentally exposed to OW
   and OA levels predicted for 2100, under two CO2 Representative
   Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The impact of OW and OA on early
   life-history stages was also assessed for one of these species to
   provide a more holistic view of species impacts. All species were
   generally unaffected by conditions predicted under RCP6.0, although
   environmental conditions projected under RCP8.5 caused significant
   adverse effects: with elevated temperature decreasing the survival of
   all species, increasing levels of tissue necrosis and bleaching,
   elevating respiration rates and decreasing photosynthetic rates. OA
   alone had little adverse effect, even under RCP8.5 concentrations.
   Importantly, the interactive effect of OW and OA varied between species
   with different nutritional modes, with elevated pCO(2) exacerbating
   temperature stress in heterotrophic species but mitigating temperature
   stress in phototrophic species. This antagonistic interaction was
   reflected by reduced mortality, necrosis and bleaching of phototrophic
   species in the highest OW/OA treatment. Survival and settlement success
   of Carteriospongia foliascens larvae were unaffected by experimental
   treatments, and juvenile sponges exhibited greater tolerance to OW than
   their adult counterparts. With elevated pCO(2) providing phototrophic
   species with protection from elevated temperature, across different life
   stages, climate change may ultimately drive a shift in the composition
   of sponge assemblages towards a dominance of phototrophic species.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Coral reefs are found within a limited range of environmental conditions
   or tolerance limits. Estimating these limits is a critical prerequisite
   for understanding the impacts of climate change on the biogeography of
   coral reefs. Here we used the diagnostic model ReefHab to determine the
   current environmental tolerance limits for coral reefs and the global
   distribution of potential coral reef habitats as a function of six
   factors: temperature, salinity, nitrate, phosphate, aragonite saturation
   state, and light. To determine these tolerance limits, we extracted
   maximum and minimum values of all environmental variables in
   corresponding locations where coral reefs are present. We found that the
   global, annually averaged tolerance limits for coral reefs are 21.7-29.6
   degrees C for temperature, 28.7-40.4 psu for salinity, 4.51 mu mol L-1
   for nitrate, 0.63 mu mol L-1 for phosphate, and 2.82 for aragonite
   saturation state. The averaged minimum light intensity in coral reefs is
   450 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1). The global area of potential reef
   habitats calculated by the model is 330.5 x 10(3) km(2). Compared with
   previous studies, the tolerance limits for temperature, salinity, and
   nutrients have not changed much, whereas the minimum value of aragonite
   saturation in coral reef waters has decreased from 3.28 to 2.82. The
   potential reef habitat area calculated with ReefHab is about 121x10(3)
   km(2) larger than the area estimated from the charted reefs, suggesting
   that the growth potential of coral reefs is higher than currently
   observed.},

Abstract = {Purpose Soil respiration and N-mineralization are key processes in C and
   N cycling of terrestrial ecosystems. Both processes are limited by soil
   temperature, moisture and nutrient content in arid and cold ecosystems,
   but how soil nutrient addition interacts with increased precipitation
   requires further investigation. Methods The experiment consisted of 4
   treatments: a) control, b) fertilization, applying 100 kg N yr(-1) and
   75 kg P yr(-1), c) irrigation, increasing the average annual rainfall by
   20-25\%, distributed in 6-8 irrigation events, and d)
   irrigation+fertilization. We measured soil respiration and
   N-mineralization throughout seasons. Results Increases in annual
   precipitation had no effects on long-term soil respiration in any
   season. However, soil nutrient enrichment increased soil respiration by
   19\% during the plant growing season, and also increased root density by
   30-45\% throughout the year. The combined N + P and water addition did
   not increase soil respiration more than the nutrient addition alone. N +
   P addition had negative impacts on N-mineralization, resulting in
   N-immobilization. However, soil ammonium and nitrate content increased
   with N + P addition all over the seasons. Conclusion Moderate increases
   in the total annual precipitation lead to no long-term response of soil
   processes in Patagonian steppe. However, with higher soil nutrient
   input, such as with anthropogenic N deposition, soil CO2 effluxes are
   likely to increase, and microbial biomass could retain more nutrients in
   the soil. Therefore, high levels of soil N enrichment in arid ecosystems
   may strengthen the positive feedback between C cycle and climate change
   if this increment is not compensate by higher carbon capture.},

Abstract = {Hermatypic-zooxanthellate corals track the diel patterns of the main
   environmental parameters temperature, UV and visible light - by
   acclimation processes that include biochemical responses. The diel
   course of solar radiation is followed by photosynthesis rates and
   thereby elicits simultaneous changes in tissue oxygen tension due to the
   shift in photosynthesis/respiration balance. The recurrent patterns of
   sunlight are reflected in fluorescence yields, photosynthetic pigment
   content and activity of the two protective enzymes superoxide dismutase
   (SOD) and catalase (CAT), enzymes that are among the universal defenses
   against free radical damage in living tissue. All of these were
   investigated in three scleractinian corals: Favia favus, Plerogyra
   sinuosa and Goniopora lobata. The activity of SOD and CAT in the animal
   host followed the course of solar radiation, increased with the rates of
   photosynthetic oxygen production and was correlated with a decrease in
   the maximum quantum yield of photochemistry in Photosystem H (PSII)
   (Delta F'/F-m'). SOD and CAT activity in the symbiotic algae also
   exhibited a light intensity correlated pattern, albeit a less pronounced
   one. The observed rise of the free-radical-scavenger enzymes, with a
   time scale of minutes to several hours, is an important protective
   mechanism for the existence and remarkable success of the unique
   cnidarian-dinoflagellate associations, in which photosynthetic oxygen
   production takes place within animal cells. This represents a facet of
   the precarious act of balancing the photosynthetic production of oxygen
   by the algal symbionts with their destructive action on all living
   cells, especially those of the animal host.},

Abstract = {Symbiotic colonies of the coral Acropora sp. were cultured in a
   factorial design of three temperatures (21, 25 and 28 degrees C) and two
   light intensities (200 and 400 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1)), under
   constant conditions. A temperature of 25 degrees C and a light intensity
   of 200 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1) was the starting culture condition.
   Metabolic (photosynthesis, respiration, calcification and surface
   expansion rate) and geochemical measurements (delta O-18, delta C-13,
   Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca) were conducted on 6 colonies for each experimental
   condition. Metabolic measurements confirmed that respiration,
   photosynthesis, calcification and surface expansion rate responded to
   the combined effect of temperature and light. Under each light
   intensity, mean calcification rate was linearly correlated with mean
   photosynthetic activity. Geochemical measurements were also influenced
   by temperature and, to a lesser degree, by light. All geochemical
   proxies measured on 6 nubbins showed a wide scattering of values,
   regardless of the environmental condition. Compared to the other
   proxies, delta O-18 exhibited a different behavior. It was the only
   proxy exhibiting temperature tracer behavior. However, while mean values
   of Sr/Ca, Mg/Ca and delta C-13 were well correlated, the correlation
   between the later and mean delta O-18 differed with light level. This
   suggests that both skeleton deposition and temperature oxygen
   fractionation differs according to light intensity. Overall, the effect
   of light on geochemical values seems to compromise the use of proxy
   calibrations solely based on temperature influence.
   Under high light conditions, the great amplitude shown by individual net
   photosynthesis is directly proportional to the highly variable
   zooxanthellae density. As light is affecting all of the proxies, we thus
   assume that the strong geochemical variability observed could be
   explained by various algae densities, each nubbin responding according
   to its zooxanthellae amount. Accordingly, we suggest that each
   symbiosome (the assemblage of few corallites with their symbionts)
   presents its own vital effect influence over time. Therefore, at a bulk
   sample scale, light could be considered as one of the major causes of
   what is commonly referred to as the `vital effect'. The meaning of delta
   O-18 calibration versus temperature established from distinct colonies
   differs from calibration calculated from samples collected following the
   growth axis of a single coral head.
   Finally, in order to quantitatively reconstruct climatic condition, we
   suggest a new paradigm based on the statistical treatment of the
   combination of time-series information from several proxies, all
   measured on the same sample from a continuous symbiosome. (C) 2014

   had a 3.1 degrees C higher threshold RBT than those from WLT. In
   addition, MDH activity in P. verweyi from NPP-OL showed higher thermal
   resistance than those from WLT by higher optimum temperatures and the
   activation energy required for inactivating the enzyme by heat. The MDH
   from NPP-OL also had two times higher residual activity than that from
   WLT after incubation at 50 degrees C for 1 h. The results of RBT and
   thermal properties of MDH in P. verweyi demonstrate potential
   physiological and enzymatic response to a long-term and regular thermal
   stress, independent of their Symbiodiniaceae partner.},

   composition of Porites panamensis in the southern Gulf of California},

Abstract = {Coral delta O-18 variations are used as a proxy for changes in sea
   surface temperature (SST) and seawater isotope composition. Skeletal
   delta C-13 of coral is frequently used as a proxy for solar radiation
   because most of its variability is controlled by an interrelationship
   between three processes: photosynthesis, respiration, and feeding. Coral
   growth rate is known to influence the delta O-18 and delta C-13 isotope
   record to a lesser extent than environmental variables. Recent published
   data show differences in growth parameters between female and male coral
   in the gonochoric brooding coral Porites panamensis; thus, skeletal
   delta O-18 and delta C-13 are hypothesized to be different in each sex.
   To test this, this study describes changes in the skeletal delta O-18
   and delta C-13 record of four female and six male Porites panamensis
   coral collected in Bahia de La Paz, Mexico, whose growth bands spanned
   12 years. The isotopic data were compared to SST, precipitation,
   photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), chlorophyll a, and skeletal
   growth parameters. Porites panamensis is a known gonochoric brooder
   whose growth parameters are different in females and males. Splitting
   the data by sexes explained 81 and 93 \% of the differences of delta
   O-18, and of delta C-13, respectively, in the isotope record between
   colonies. Both isotope records were different between sexes. delta O-18
   was higher in female colonies than in male colonies, with a 0.31 \%o
   difference; delta C-13 was lower in female colonies, with a 0.28 parts
   per thousand difference. A difference in the skeletal delta O-18 could
   introduce an error in SST estimates of ti 1.0 to ti 2.6 degrees C. The
   delta O-18 records showed a seasonal pattern that corresponded to SST,
   with low correlation coefficients (-0.45, 0.32), and gentle slopes
   (0.09, 0.10 \%0 C-1) of the delta O-18 SST relation. Seasonal variation
   in coral delta O-18 represents only 52.37 and 35.66 \% of the SST cycle;
   29.72 and 38.53 \% can be attributed to delta O-18 variability in
   seawater. delta C-13 data did not correlate with any of the
   environmental variables; therefore, variations in skeletal delta C-13
   appear to be driven mainly by metabolic effects. Our results support the
   hypothesis of a sex-associated difference in skeletal delta O-18 and
   delta C-13 signal, and suggest that environmental conditions and coral
   growth parameters affect skeletal isotopic signals differently in each
   sex. Although these findings relate to one gonochoric brooding species,
   they may have some implications for the more commonly used gonochoric
   spawning species such as Porites lutea and Porites lobata.},

Abstract = {Fluorometric measurements of maximum quantum yield (F-v/F-m) and fast
   induction curves (FICs) require coral samples to be dark-adapted (DA).
   Pathways causing dark-reduction of the plastoquinone (PQ) pool are shown
   here to be active in corals. Early morning sunlight and far-red light
   successfully increased F-v/F-m and lowered the O and J steps of FICs in
   corals that were darkened overnight. The thick-tissued massive coral,
   Cyphastrea serailia, was shown to be more prone to reduction of the PQ
   pool, with significant reductions in F-v/F-m occurring after 10 min of
   DA, and elevated J steps occurring within 200 s following a far-red
   flash. In thinner-tissued branching species, Pocillopora damicornis and
   Acropora nobilis, elevation of the J step also occurred within 200 s of
   DA, but a drop in F-v/F-m was only manifested after 30 min. Pre-exposure
   to far-red light is an effective and simple procedure to ensure
   determination of the true maximum quantum yield of Photosystem II (PSII)
   and accurate FICs which require a fully oxidised inter-system electron
   transport chain and open PSII reaction centres.},

   Pocillopora damicornis following thermal stress},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},

Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Understanding which factors enhance or mitigate the impact of high
   temperatures on corals is crucial to predict the severity of coral
   bleaching worldwide. On the one hand, global warming is usually
   associated with high ultraviolet radiation levels (UVR), and surface
   water nutrient depletion due to stratification. On the other hand,
   eutrophication of coastal reefs increases levels of inorganic nutrients
   and decreases UVR, so that the effect of different combinations of these
   stressors on corals is unknown. In this study, we assessed the
   individual and crossed effects of high temperature, UVR and nutrient
   level on the key performance variables of the reef building coral
   Pocillopora damicornis. We found that seawater warming was the major
   stressor, which induced bleaching and impaired coral photosynthesis and
   calcification in all nutrient and UVR conditions. The strength of this
   effect however, was nutrient dependent. Corals maintained in
   nutrient-depleted conditions experienced the highest decrease in net
   photosynthesis under thermal stress, while nutrient enrichment (3 mu M
   NO3- and 1 mu M PO4+) slightly limited the negative impact of
   temperature through enhanced protein content, photosynthesis and
   respiration rates. UVR exposure had only an effect on total nitrogen
   release rates, which significantly decreased under normal growth
   conditions and tended to decrease also under thermal stress. This result
   suggests that increased level of UVR will lead to significant changes in
   the nutrient biogeochemistry of surface reef waters. Overall, our
   results show that environmental factors have different and interactive
   effects on each of the coral's physiological parameters, requiring
   multifactorial approaches to predict the future of coral reefs.},

Title = {Symbiont genotype influences holobiont response to increased temperature},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {As coral reefs face warming oceans and increased coral bleaching, a
   whitening of the coral due to loss of microalgal endosymbionts, the
   possibility of evolutionary rescue offers some hope for reef
   persistence. In tightly linked mutualisms, evolutionary rescue may occur
   through evolution of the host and/or endosymbionts. Many obligate
   mutualisms are composed of relatively small, fast-growing symbionts with
   greater potential to evolve on ecologically relevant time scales than
   their relatively large, slower growing hosts. Numerous jellyfish species
   harbor closely related endosymbiont taxa to other cnidarian species such
   as coral, and are commonly used as a model system for investigating
   cnidarian mutualisms. We examined the potential for adaptation of the
   upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea xamachana to increased temperature via
   evolution of its microalgal endosymbiont, Symbiodinium microadriaticum.
   We quantified trait variation among five algal genotypes in response to
   three temperatures (26 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 32 degrees C) and
   fitness of hosts infected with each genotype. All genotypes showed
   positive growth rates at each temperature, but rates of respiration and
   photosynthesis decreased with increased temperature. Responses varied
   among genotypes but were unrelated to genetic similarity. The effect of
   temperature on asexual reproduction and the timing of development in the
   host also depended on the genotype of the symbiont. Natural selection
   could favor different algal genotypes at different temperatures,
   affecting host fitness. This eco-evolutionary interaction may be a
   critical component of understanding species resilience in increasingly
   stressful environments.},

Journal = {GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {84},
Pages = {534-542},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {delta C-13 was determined at a high spatial resolution by secondary ion
   mass spectrometry (SIMS) across a 1 year section of a modern Porites
   lobata coral skeleton from Hawaii. Skeletal delta C-13 is dominated by
   large oscillations of 5-7 parts per thousand that typically cover
   skeletal distances equivalent to periods of similar to 14-40 days. These
   variations do not reflect seawater temperature and it is unlikely that
   they reflect variations in the delta C-13 of local seawater. We observe
   no correlation between skeletal delta C-13 and the pH of the
   calcification fluid (estimated from previous measurements of skeletal
   delta B-11). We conclude that either the proportion of skeletal carbon
   derived from metabolic CO2 is not reflected by estimated ECF pH (as the
   {[}CO2] in the overlying coral tissue varies) and/or the delta C-13
   composition of the metabolic CO2 is highly variable. We also observe no
   correlation between skeletal delta C-13 and previous delta O-18 SIMS
   measurements. Variations in skeletal delta C-13 and delta O-18 do not
   have a common timing, providing no evidence that skeletal delta C-13 and
   delta O-18 vary in response to a single factor. This suggests that
   skeletal delta C-13 is principally driven by variations in the delta
   C-13 composition of metabolic CO2 rather than by the abundance of
   metabolic CO2, which would also affect skeletal delta O-18. The delta
   C-13 composition of metabolic CO2 reflects the processes of
   photosynthesis, heterotrophic feeding and respiration in the overlying
   coral tissue. Corals catabolise stored lipid reserves to meet energetic
   demands when photosynthesis conditions are sub-optimal. Variations in
   the amounts and types of reserves utilised could induce changes in the
   delta C-13 composition of metabolic CO2 and the resultant skeleton which
   are temporally offset from skeletal delta O-18 records. (C) 2012

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2004},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Especially in aquatic habitats, hypoxia can be an important evolutionary
   driving force resulting in both convergent and divergent physiological
   strategies for hypoxic survival. Examining adaptations to anoxic/
   hypoxic survival in hypoxia-tolerant animals may offer fresh ideas for
   the treatment of hypoxia-related diseases. Here, we summarise our
   present knowledge of two fishes that have evolved to survive hypoxia
   under very different circumstances. The crucian carp (Carassius
   carassius) is of particular interest because of its extreme anoxia
   tolerance. During the long North European winter, it survives for months
   in completely oxygen-deprived freshwater habitats.
   The crucian carp also tolerates a few days of anoxia at room temperature
   and, unlike anoxia-tolerant freshwater turtles, it is still physically
   active in anoxia. Moreover, the crucian carp does not appear to reduce
   neuronal ion permeability during anoxia and may primarily rely on more
   subtle neuromodulatory mechanisms for anoxic metabolic depression.
   The epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) is a tropical marine
   vertebrate. It lives on shallow reef platforms that repeatedly become
   cut off from the ocean during periods of low tides. During nocturnal low
   tides, the water {[}O-2] can fall by 80\% due to respiration of the
   coral and associated organisms. Since the tides become lower and lower
   over a period of a few days, the hypoxic exposure during subsequent low
   tides will become progressively longer and more severe. Thus, this shark
   is under a natural hypoxic preconditioning regimen. Interestingly,
   hypoxic preconditioning lowers its metabolic rate and its critical Po-2.
   Moreover, repeated anoxia appears to stimulate metabolic depression in
   an adenosine-dependent way.},

Abstract = {Natural respiration rates of suspension feeders in temperate ecosystems
   are still poorly known. This lack of information constrains our
   understanding of the functioning and dynamics of benthic marine
   ecosystems in temperate areas. We examined the in situ seasonal
   variation in respiration rate of three benthic suspension feeders (a
   sponge, an ascidian, and a gorgonian) in northwestern Mediterranean
   sublittoral communities using a recirculating flow respirometry system.
   The in situ technique is shown to be highly applicable to seasonal
   studies of the physiological energetics of benthic suspension feeders.
   Respiration rates of the three species varied two- to threefold through
   the annual cycle, exhibiting a marked seasonal pattern but showing no
   daily cycle or significant day-to-day variability within months. The
   respiration rate of the sponge and ascidian, active suspension feeders,
   increased with temperature. The respiration rate of the gorgonian, a
   passive suspension feeder, did not correlate with temperature. We
   estimated a Q(10) of 1.1, which indicates that respiration rate in this
   species is not highly dependent on temperature. Synthesis of new tissue
   of some Mediterranean benthic suspension feeders, such as gorgonians,
   does not correlate with temperature, which allowed us to isolate the
   effects of temperature and synthesis of new tissue on respiration rate.
   Synthesis of new tissue increased respiration rate of the gorgonian by
   similar to40\%. The low rate of synthesis of new tissue during summer,
   together with the contraction of polyps and the low Q(10) explains the
   low respiration rates of the gorgonian observed during the period of
   highest temperature. These low respiration rates support the hypothesis
   that energy limitations may underlie summer dormancy in some benthic:
   suspension-feeding taxa in the Mediterranean.},

Abstract = {The evolutionary success of animal design is strongly affected by
   scaling and virtually all metazoans are constrained by allometry. One
   body plan that appears to relax these constraints is a colonial modular
   (CM) design, in which modular iteration is hypothesized to support
   isometry and indeterminate colony size. In this study, growth rates of
   juvenile scleractinians (less than 40 mm diameter) with a CM design were
   used to test this assertion using colony diameters recorded annually for
   a decade and scaling exponents (b) for growth calculated from double
   logarithmic plots of final versus initial diameters. For all juvenile
   corals, b differed significantly among years, with isometry (b = 1) in 4
   years, but positive allometry (b > 1) in 5 years. The study years were
   characterized by differences in seawater temperature that were
   associated significantly with b for growth, with isometry in warm years
   but positive allometry in cool years. These results illustrate variable
   growth scaling in a CM taxon and suggest that the switch between scaling
   modes is mediated by temperature. For the corals studied, growth was not
   constrained by size, but this outcome was achieved through both isometry
   and positive allometry. Under cooler conditions, positive allometry may
   be beneficial as it represents a growth advantage that increases with
   size.},

Abstract = {In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the importance of water
   flow for skeletal growth (rate) becomes higher with increasing
   irradiance levels (i.e. a synergistic effect) and that such effect is
   mediated by a water flow modulated effect on net photosynthesis. Four
   series of nine nubbins of G. fascicularis were grown at either high (600
   mu E m(-2) s(-1)) or intermediate (300 mu E m(-2) s(-1)) irradiance in
   combination with either high (15-25 cm s(-1)) or low (5-10 cm s(-1))
   flow. Growth was measured as buoyant weight and surface area.
   Photosynthetic rates were measured at each coral's specific experimental
   irradiance and flow speed. Additionally, the instantaneous effect of
   water flow on net photosynthetic rate was determined in short-term
   incubations in a respirometric flowcell. A significant interaction was
   found between irradiance and water flow for the increase in buoyant
   weight, the increase in surface area, and specific skeletal growth rate,
   indicating that flow velocity becomes more important for coral growth
   with increasing irradiance levels. Enhancement of coral growth with
   increasing water flow can be explained by increased net photosynthetic
   rates. Additionally, the need for costly photo-protective mechanisms at
   low flow regimes could explain the differences in growth with flow.},

   between 8.0 and 8.2 during only 30 \% of the observational period, with
   approximately even distribution of the remaining 70 \% of the time
   between pH(T) values less than 8.0 and greater than 8.2. Thermal and
   biogeochemical variability in the back reefs is partially controlled by
   tidal modulation of wave-driven flow, which isolates the back reefs at
   low tide and brings offshore water into the back reefs at high tide. The
   ratio of net community calcification to net community production was
   0.15 +/- 0.01, indicating that metabolism on the back reef was dominated
   by primary production and respiration. Similar to other back reef
   systems, the back reefs of Ofu are carbon sinks during the daytime.
   Shallow back reefs like those in Ofu may provide insights for how coral
   communities respond to extreme temperatures and acidification and are
   deserving of continued attention.},

Abstract = {{[}1] Monitoring seawater CO2 for a full year with seasonal observations
   of community metabolism in Ishigaki Island, Japan, revealed seasonal
   variation and anomalous values owing to the bleaching event in 1998. The
   daily average pCO(2) showed a seasonal pattern on an annual scale, 280
   to 320 mu atm in winter and 360 to 400 mu atm in summer, which was
   determined primarily by the seasonal change in seawater temperature. By
   contrast, the range in the diel variation in pCO(2), 400 to 500 mu atm
   in summer 200 to 300 matm in winter, was attributed to the seasonal
   variation in community metabolism: Gross primary production (P-g) and
   respiration ( R) were high in summer and low in winter. During the 1998
   bleaching event, although Pg and R increased, community excess organic
   production ( E) decreased by three quarters compared with the same month
   in 1999, when the coral community showed high recovery. This change in
   metabolism led to large diel range and increased average value of pCO(2)
   levels in the seawater on the reef flat. The decrease in the range and
   increase in the average value of pCO(2) were observed by monitoring the
   Palau barrier reef flat, where overall mortality of corals occurred
   after the bleaching. All the metabolic parameters, Pg, R, E and
   calcification (G) were reduced by half after the bleaching, which
   increased the average pCO2 value by 10 matm and decreased its diel range
   from 200 - 400 mu atm to 100 - 200 mu atm. Bleaching and resultant
   mortality of coral reefs led to degradation of their metabolic
   performance, and thus resulted in the loss of their active interaction
   with the carbon cycle.},

Abstract = {Sponges are often important components of coastal lagoons, however their
   responses to anthropogenic stressors remain poorly understood. Here, we
   tested the responses of three lagoon sponges, Neopetrosia exigua,
   Amphimedon navalis and Spheciospongia vagabunda from Mauritius (Western
   Indian Ocean), to nine temperature and nitrate combinations for 14 days.
   We found that elevated seawater temperature resulted in significant
   physiological responses in all species, but there was generally little
   negative effect of elevated nitrate. At the end of the experiment, the
   buoyant weight of all three species were significantly reduced, while
   for the two chlorophyll alpha-containing species, N. exigua and S.
   vagabunda, effective quantum yield (Delta F/Fm') of photosystem (PS) II,
   photosynthetic pigment concentrations, gross photosynthetic rate and
   gross photosynthesis to respiration (P:R) ratio were also reduced. Dark
   respiration rates were higher in all three species at elevated
   temperature. While these lagoon sponges appeared to be impacted by
   elevated temperature, here, we demonstrate that these species are
   physiologically tolerant to excess nitrate concentrations.},

Title = {Mine Waste and Acute Warming Induce Energetic Stress in the Deep-Sea
   Sponge Geodia atlantica and Coral Primnoa resedeaformis; Results From a
   Mesocosm Study},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Month = {APR 12},
Abstract = {There is the potential for climate change to interact with pollution in
   all of the Earth's oceans. In the fjords of Norway, mine tailings are
   released into fjords generating suspended sediment plumes that impact
   deep-sea ecosystems. These same deep-sea ecosystems are expected to
   undergo periodic warming as climate change increases the frequency of
   down-welling events in fjords. It remains unknown how a polluted
   deep-sea ecosystem would respond to down-welling because multiple
   stressors will often interact in unpredictable ways. Here, we exposed
   two deep-sea foundation species; the gorgonian coral Primnoa
   resedaeformis and the demosponge Geodia atlantica to suspended sediment
   (10 mg L-1) and acute warming (+5 degrees C) in a factorial mesocosm
   experiment for 40 days. Physiology (respiration, nutrient flux) and
   cellular responses (lysosomal cell stability) were measured for both the
   coral and sponge. Exposure to elevated suspended sediment reduced
   metabolism, supressed silicate uptake and induced cellular instability
   of the sponge G. atlantica. However, combining sediment with warming
   caused G. atlantica to respire and excrete nitrogen at a greater rate.
   For the coral P resedaeformis, suspended sediments reduced O:N ratios
   after 40 days, however, warming had a greater effect on P resedaeformis
   physiology compared to sediment. Warming increased respiration, nitrogen
   excretion, and cellular instability which resulted in lower O:N ratios.
   We argue that suspended sediment and warming can act alone and also
   interact to cause significant harm to deep-sea biota, however responses
   are likely to be species-specific. Warming and pollution could interact
   in the deep-sea to cause mortality to the coral P resedaeformis and to a
   lesser extent, the sponge G. atlantica. As foundation species, reducing
   the abundance of deep sea corals and sponges would likely impact the
   ecosystems they support.},

Title = {Optimum Temperatures for Net Primary Productivity of Three Tropical
   Seagrass Species},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {AUG 23},
Abstract = {Rising sea water temperature will play a significant role in responses
   of the world's seagrass meadows to climate change. In this study, we
   investigated seasonal and latitudinal variation (spanning more than
   1,500 km) in seagrass productivity, and the optimum temperatures at
   which maximum photosynthesis and net productivity (for the leaf and the
   whole plant) occurs, for three seagrass species (Cymodocea serrulata,
   Halodule uninervis, and Zostera muelleri). To obtain whole plant net
   production, photosynthesis, and respiration rates of leaves and the
   root/rhizome complex were measured using oxygen-sensitive optodes in
   closed incubation chambers at temperatures ranging from 15 to 43 degrees
   C. The temperature-dependence of photosynthesis and respiration was
   fitted to empirical models to obtain maximum metabolic rates and thermal
   optima. The thermal optimum (T-opt) for gross photosynthesis of Z.
   muelleri, which is more commonly distributed in sub-tropical to
   temperate regions, was 31 degrees C. The T-opt for photosynthesis of the
   tropical species, H. uninervis and C. serrulata, was considerably higher
   (35 degrees C on average). This suggests that seagrass species are
   adapted to water temperature within their distributional range; however,
   when comparing among latitudes and seasons, thermal optima within a
   species showed limited acclimation to ambient water temperature (T-opt
   varied by 1 degrees C in C. serrulata and 2 degrees C in H. uninervis,
   and the variation did not follow changes in ambient water temperature).
   The T-opt for gross photosynthesis were higher than T-opt calculated
   from plant net productivity, which includes above- and below-ground
   respiration for Z. muelleri (24 degrees C) and H. uninervis (33 degrees
   C), but remained unchanged at 35 degrees C in C. serrulata. Both
   estimated plant net productivity and T-opt are sensitive to the
   proportion of below-ground biomass, highlighting the need for
   consideration of below- to above-ground biomass ratios when applying
   thermal optima to other meadows. The thermal optimum for plant net
   productivity was lower than ambient summer water temperature in Z.
   muelleri, indicating likely contemporary heat stress. In contrast,
   thermal optima of H. uninervis and C. serrulata exceeded ambient water
   temperature. This study found limited capacity to acclimate: thus the
   thermal optima can forewarn of both the present and future vulnerability
   to ocean warming during periods of elevated water temperature.},

Abstract = {The successful dispersal of coral larvae is vital to the population
   replenishment and reef recovery and resilience. De -spite that this
   critical early stage is susceptible to ocean warming and acidification,
   little is known about the responses of coral larvae to warming and
   acidification across different biological scales. This study explored
   the influences of el-evated temperature (29 ? versus 33 ?) and pCO2 (500
   mu atm versus 1000 mu atm) on brooded larvae of Pocillopora damicornis
   at the organismal, cellular and gene expression levels. Heat stress
   caused bleaching, depressed light-enhanced dark respiration,
   photosynthesis and autotrophy, whereas high pCO(2) stimulated
   photosynthesis. Although survival was unaffected, larvae at 33 ? were
   ten-times more likely to settle than those at 29 ?, suggesting reduced
   capacity to disperse and differentiate suitable substrate. Remarkably,
   heat stress induced greater symbiont loss at am -bient pCO(2) than at
   high pCO(2), while cell-specific pigment concentrations of symbionts at
   33 \& DEG;C increased twofold under ambient pCO2 relative to high pCO(2)
   suggesting pCO(2)-dependent bleaching patterns. Considerable increases
   in activities of host antioxidants superoxide dismutase (SOD) and
   catalase (CAT) at 33 ? indicated oxidative stress, whereas lipid
   peroxidation and caspase activities were contained, thereby restraining
   larval mortality at 33 ?. Fur -thermore, the coral host mounted stronger
   transcriptional responses than symbionts. High pCO(2) stimulated host
   met-abolic pathways, possibly because of the boosted algal productivity.
   In contrast, host metabolic processes and symbiont photosystem genes
   were downregulated at 33 ?. Interestingly, the upregulation of
   extracellular matrix genes and glycosaminoglycan degradation pathway at
   33 ? was more evident under ambient pCO(2) than high pCO(2), suggesting
   compromised host tissue integrity that could have facilitated symbiont
   expulsion and bleaching. Our results provide insights into how coral
   larvae respond to warming and acidification at different levels of
   biological organization, and demonstrate that ocean acidification can
   mediate thermal bleaching and gene expression in coral larvae under heat
   stress.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are essential to many nations, and are currently in global
   decline. Although climate models predict decreases in seawater pH
   (similar to 0.3 units) and oxygen saturation (similar to 5 percentage
   points), these are exceeded by the current daily pH and oxygen
   fluctuations on many reefs (pH 7.8-8.7 and 27-241\% O-2 saturation). We
   investigated the effect of oxygen and pH fluctuations on coral
   calcification in the laboratory using the model species Acropora
   millepora. Light calcification rates were greatly enhanced (+178\%) by
   increased seawater pH, but only at normoxia; hyperoxia completely
   negated this positive effect. Dark calcification rates were
   significantly inhibited (51-75\%) at hypoxia, whereas pH had no effect.
   Our preliminary results suggest that within the current oxygen and pH
   range, oxygen has substantial control over coral growth, whereas the
   role of pH is limited. This has implications for reef formation in this
   era of rapid climate change, which is accompanied by a decrease in
   seawater oxygen saturation owing to higher water temperatures and

Abstract = {Ecosystem resilience to climate anomalies is related to the
   physiological plasticity of organisms. To characterize the physiological
   response of some common Mediterranean gorgonians to fluctuations in
   temperature, four species (Paramuricea clavata, Eunicella singularis,
   Eunicella cavolinii and Corallium rubrum) were maintained in aquaria, in
   which the temperature was increased every ten days with increments of
   2-3 degrees C, starting at 14 degrees C, ending at 25 degrees C. Oxygen
   consumption, number of open/closed polyps and percentage of necrotic
   tissue were monitored. All species showed similar activity patterns with
   increasing temperature. P. clavata and E. singularis showed the highest
   respiration rate at 18 degrees C, E. cavolinii and C rubrum at 20
   degrees C. Above these temperatures, both oxygen consumption and polyp
   reactivity decreased in all species. The present data confirm a
   reduction of the metabolic activity in Mediterranean gorgonians during
   periods of high temperature. At temperatures above 18 degrees C, the
   percentage of open polyps (considered as a parameter to evaluate polyps
   reactivity) decreased, thus mirroring the trend of oxygen consumption.
   The average values of Q(10) indicated that gorgonians have a definite
   temperature limit over which the metabolism (oxygen consumption) stop to
   follow the temperature increase. After three days at 25 degrees C,
   metabolic activity in E. cavolinii, C. rubrum and P. clavata further
   decreased and the first signs of necrosis were observed. At this
   temperature, activity remained unchanged in E. singularis. This species
   seems to more resistant to thermal stress. The symbiotic zooxanthellae
   present in this species are likely to provide an alternative source of
   energy when polyps reduce their feeding activity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Anthropogenic CO2-emission is causing ocean warming and acidification.
   Understanding how basic physiological processes of marine organisms
   respond to these stressors is important for predicting their responses
   to future global change. We examined the effects of elevated pCO(2) and
   temperature (pCO(2) = 344-2199 ppm; temperature = 6 degrees C, 9 degrees
   C, and 12 degrees C) on the calcification rate, extrapallial fluid (EPF)
   carbonate chemistry, respiration, and survivorship of Atlantic sea
   scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) in a fully crossed 143-d experiment.
   Rates of calcification and respiration were inhibited by elevated
   pCO(2), and mortality occurred when elevated pCO(2) was accompanied by
   high-temperature stress. Declines in growth and survivorship were likely
   caused by external shell dissolution, thermal stress, and hypercapnic
   reduction of metabolism under elevated pCO(2). Concentrations of
   dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity in the EPF
   increased above seawater concentrations in response to elevated pCO(2).
   EPF pH declined, but did not decline as much as seawater pH, indicating
   that scallops regulate EPF pH to support calcification. The combination
   of EPF pH regulation and DIC elevation yielded an increase in EPF
   {[}CO32-\$\$ \{\textbackslash{}mathrm\{CO\}\}\_3<\^{}>\{2-\} \$\$] under
   elevated pCO(2) treatments. The combination of low respiration rates,
   high EPF {[}CO32-\$\$ \{\textbackslash{}mathrm\{CO\}\}\_3<\^{}>\{2-\}
   \$\$], and low calcification rates under elevated pCO(2) suggests that
   the impaired calcification arises more from hypercapnic inhibition of
   metabolic activity and external shell dissolution than from chemically
   unfavorable conditions in the EPF. These results demonstrate the
   importance of EPF chemistry for bivalve biomineralization, but show that
   regulation efforts are insufficient to fully offset the deleterious
   effects of elevated pCO(2) on scallop performance.},

Abstract = {In southern Taiwan, brooded larvae of Pocillopora damicornis and
   Seriatopora caliendrum are released year-round in synchrony with new
   moons, and each larval release occurs over multiple days. Using P.
   damicornis and S. caliendrum as a model system, we describe within-brood
   variation in larval phenotypes and test for release-day effects that
   influence larval performance in the pelagic phase. Research was
   conducted in 2010 using larvae from corals collected in June and July
   from Nanwan Bay (21A degrees 56.179'N, 120A degrees 44.85'E). In June,
   larval phenotypes of both species were characterized immediately
   following release, and their competency to settle assessed. In July,
   larvae of P. damicornis were collected on 3 days over the peak release
   period and incubated for 7-11 days at 28.0 A degrees C and 320 mu mol
   quanta m(-2) s(-1); their phenotypes and settlement competency were
   measured every 2 days. P. damicornis larvae released close to peak
   release were 1.6 times larger in size, contained twice the number of
   Symbiodinium larva(-1), and were 44 \% more likely to settle in the
   first 24 h than larvae released early in the brood. In addition,
   peak-release larvae respired at a lower rate than larvae released late
   in the brood. Similarly, S. caliendrum larvae released close to peak
   release were 1.4 times larger in size and were 33 \% more likely to
   settle in the first 5 h than larvae released early in the brood. In
   July, P. damicornis larvae differed between early (2 days prior to
   peak), peak, and late (2 days after peak) release. Protein content of
   early-release larvae was lower than peak- and late-release larvae, and
   this difference persisted throughout the development. Further, release
   day affected the way larval respiration varied throughout development.
   By showing that brooded coral larvae differ between release days and
   display maternal effects influencing performance in the swimming phase,
   our results suggest that pocilloporid corals utilize bet-hedging to
   increase reproductive success.},

   reconstruction of past information on seawater, the carbon isotope ratio
   is considered a proxy for physiological processes, principally
   photosynthesis and respiration. However, the fractionation of carbon
   isotopes in biogenic carbonate such as coral skeleton is still unclear.
   We conducted a long-term culture experiment of Porites spp. corals at
   different light dosages ( light intensity, 100, 300, or 500 mu mol m(-2)
   s(-1); daily light period, 10 or 12 h) at 25 +/- 0.6 degrees C to
   examine the contribution of photosynthetic activity to skeletal carbon
   isotope composition. Corals were grown in sand-filtered seawater and not
   fed; thus, they subsisted from photosynthesis of symbiotic algae. As the
   daily dose of photosynthetically active radiation increased, the rate of
   annual extension also increased. Mean isotope compositions shifted; the
   carbon isotope compositions (delta C-13) became heavier and the oxygen
   isotope compositions ( delta O-18) became lighter at higher radiation
   dose. Skeletal delta O-18 decrease coincided with increasing skeletal
   growth rate, indicating the influence of so-called kinetic isotope
   effects. The observed delta C-13 increase should be subject to both
   kinetic and metabolic isotope effects, with the latter reflecting
   skeletal delta C-13 enrichment due to photosynthesis by symbiotic algae.
   Using a vector approach in the delta C-13 - delta O-18 plane, we
   discriminated between kinetic and metabolic isotope effects on delta
   C-13. The calculated delta C-13 changes from metabolic isotope effects
   were light dose dependent. The delta C-13 fractionation curve related to
   metabolic isotope effects is very similar to the photosynthesis -
   irradiance curve, indicating the direct contribution of photosynthetic
   activity to metabolic isotope effects. In contrast, delta C-13
   fractionation related to kinetic isotope effects gradually increased as
   the growth rate increased. Our experiment demonstrated that the kinetic
   and metabolic isotope effects in coral skeleton were successfully
   differentiated.},

Abstract = {Sr/Ca, B/Ca, Mg/Ca and delta B-11 were determined at high spatial
   resolution across similar to 1 year of a modern Hawaiian Porites lobata
   coral by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). We observe significant
   variations in B/Ca, Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and delta B-11 over short skeletal
   distances (nominally equivalent to periods of <20 days). This
   heterogeneity probably reflects variations in the composition of the
   extracellular calcifying fluid (ECF) from which the skeleton
   precipitates. Calcification site pH (total scale) was estimated from
   skeletal delta B-11 and ranged from 8.3 to 8.8 (+/- similar to 0.1) with
   a mean of similar to 8.6. Sr/Ca and B/Ca heterogeneity is not simply
   correlated with calcification site pH, as might be expected if Ca-ATPase
   activity increases the pH and decreases the Sr/Ca and B(OH)(4)(-)/CO32-
   ratios of the ECF. We produced a simple model of the ECF composition and
   the skeleton deposited from it, over a range of calcium transport and
   carbonate scenarios, which can account for these observed geochemical
   variations. The relationship between the pH and Sr/Ca of the ECF is
   dependent on the concentration of DIC at the calcification site. At
   higher DIC concentrations the ECF has a high capacity to buffer the
   {[}H+] changes induced by Ca-ATPase pumping. Conversely, at low DIC
   concentrations, this buffering capacity is reduced and ECF pH changes
   more rapidly in response to Ca-ATPase pumping. The absence of a simple
   correlation between ECF pH and skeletal Sr/Ca implies that calcification
   occurred under a range of DIC concentrations, reflecting variations in
   the respiration and photosynthesis of the coral and symbiotic
   zooxanthellate in the overlying coral tissues. Our observations have
   important implications for the use of coral skeletons as indicators of
   palaeo-occan pH. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Shallow, permeable calcium carbonate (CaCO3) sediments make up a large
   proportion of the benthic cover on coral reefs and account for a large
   fraction of the standing stock of CaCO3. There have been a number of
   laboratory, mesocosm, and in situ studies examining shallow sediment
   metabolism and dissolution, but none of these have considered seasonal
   variability. Advective benthic chambers were used to measure in situ net
   community calcification (NCC) rates of CaCO3 sediments on Heron Island,
   Australia (Great Barrier Reef) over an annual cycle. Sediments were, on
   average, net precipitating during the day and net dissolving at night
   throughout the year. Night dissolution rates (-NCCNIGHT) were highest in
   the austral autumn and lowest in the austral winter driven by changes in
   respiration (R) and to a lesser extent temperature and omega(arag)/pH.
   Similarly, precipitation during the day (+NCCDAY) was highest in March
   and lowest in winter, driven primarily by benthic net primary production
   (NPP) and temperature. On average, sediments were net precipitating over
   a diel cycle (NCC24h) but shifted to net dissolving in July and
   December. This shift was largely caused by the differential effects of
   seasonal cycles in organic metabolism and carbonate chemistry on NCCDAY
   and NCCNIGHT. The results from this study highlight the large
   variability in sediment CaCO3 dynamics and the need to include repeated
   measurements over different months and seasons, particularly in shallow
   reef systems that can experience large swings in light, temperature, and
   carbonate chemistry.},

Abstract = {The Sr/Ca of aragonitic coral skeletons is a commonly used
   palaeothermometer. However skeletal Sr/Ca is typically dominated by
   weekly-monthly oscillations which do not reflect temperature or seawater
   composition and the origins of which are currently unknown. To test the
   impact of transcellular Ca2+ transport processes on skeletal Sr/Ca,
   colonies of the branching coral, Pocillopora damicornis, were cultured
   in the presence of inhibitors of Ca-ATPase (ruthenium red) and Ca
   channels (verapamil hydrochloride). The photosynthesis, respiration and
   calcification rates of the colonies were monitored throughout the
   experiment. The skeleton deposited in the presence of the inhibitors was
   identified (by Ca-42 spike) and analysed for Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca by
   secondary ion mass spectrometry. The Sr/Ca of the aragonite deposited in
   the presence of either of the inhibitors was not significantly different
   from that of the solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide) control, although the
   coral calcification rate was reduced by up to 66\% and 73\% in the
   ruthenium red and verapamil treatments, respectively. The typical
   precision (95\% confidence limits) of mean Sr/Ca determinations within
   any treatment was <+/- 1\% and differences in skeletal Sr/Ca between
   treatments were correspondingly small. Either Ca-ATPase and Ca channels
   transport Sr2+ and Ca2+ in virtually the same ratio in which they are
   present in seawater or transcellular processes contribute little Ca2+ to
   the skeleton and most Ca is derived from seawater transported directly
   to the calcification site. Variations in the activities of Ca-ATPase and
   Ca-channels are not responsible for the weekly-monthly Sr/Ca
   oscillations observed in skeletal chronologies, assuming that the
   specificities of Ca transcellular transport processes are similar
   between coral genera. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Influence of thermal history on the response of Montastraea annularis to
   short-term temperature exposure},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {148},
Number = {2},
Pages = {261-270},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Acclimation of reef corals to environmental conditions has been related
   to metabolic response at large geographic scales, but regional
   relationships have rarely been described. Physiological responses to
   temperature increases of Montastraea annularis (Ellis and Solander 1786)
   from an inner lagoon and an outer barrier reef in the Gulf of Honduras,
   southern Belize, were compared in May 2003. The hypothesis that inferred
   differences in thermal history would result in contrasting responses to
   elevated temperature was tested. Ambient seawater temperatures adjacent
   to corals at 4-5 m depth were measured every 15 min at inner lagoon and
   outer barrier reef collection sites for 1 year (June 2002-May 2003).
   Monthly averages and 3-day running averages (warmest period,
   July-October 2002) of daily maximum seawater temperatures were
   significantly higher (by similar to 0.5 degrees C) at inner lagoon reef
   compared to outer barrier reef sites. M. annularis photosynthesis (P)
   and respiration (R) rates were measured in respirometers at six
   temperatures between 29 degrees C and 35 degrees C approximately every
   hour, with repeated measurements over 3 h. P and R were significantly
   lower across most temperature treatments for samples collected from the
   inner lagoon compared to outer barrier reef. Both inner and outer reef
   M. annularis displayed an increase in P and R with increasing
   temperature between 29 degrees C and 32 degrees C, but above 32 degrees
   C P and R sharply declined. P/R ratio versus temperature showed a
   significant difference between the elevations of the regression lines
   suggesting that M. annularis from the outer barrier reefs may have been
   more physiologically stressed than those from the inner lagoon reefs
   when exposed to acute temperature changes. These results emphasize that
   thermal stress must be considered within the context of acclimation
   temperature, and that short-term exposures may have physiologically
   important effects on this species.},

Title = {Oxygen Metabolic Responses of Three Species of Large Benthic
   Foraminifers with Algal Symbionts to Temperature Stress},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 3},
Abstract = {Water temperature affects the physiology of large benthic foraminifers
   (LBFs) with algal symbionts dwelling in coral reef environments.
   However, the detailed physiological responses of LBF holobionts to
   temperature ranges occurring in their habitats are not known. We report
   net oxygen (O-2) production and respiration rates of three LBF
   holobionts (Baculogypsina sphaerulata and Calcarina gaudichaudii hosting
   diatom symbionts, and Amphisorus kudakajimensis hosting dinoflagellate
   symbionts) measured in the laboratory at water temperatures ranging from
   5 degrees C to 45 degrees C in 2.5 degrees C or 5 degrees C intervals
   and with light saturation levels of similar to 500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1).
   In addition, the recovery of net O-2 production and respiration rates
   after exposure to temperature stress was assessed. The net O-2
   production and respiration rates of the three LBF holobionts peaked at
   similar to 30 degrees C, indicating their optimal temperature for a
   short exposure period. At extreme high temperatures (>= 40 degrees C),
   the net O-2 production rates of all three LBF holobionts declined to
   less than zero and the respiration rates slightly decreased, indicating
   that photosynthesis of algal symbionts was inactivated. At extreme low
   temperatures (<= 10 degrees C for two calcarinid species and <= 5
   degrees C for A. kudakajimensis), the net O-2 production and respiration
   rates were near zero, indicating a weakening of holobiont activity.
   After exposure to extreme high or low temperature, the net O-2
   production rates did not recover until the following day, whereas the
   respiration rates recovered rapidly, suggesting that a longer time
   (days) is required for recovery from damage to the photosystem by
   temperature stress compared to the respiration system. These results
   indicate that the oxygen metabolism of LBF holobionts can generally cope
   well with conditions that fluctuate diurnally and seasonally in their
   habitats. However, temporal heat and cold stresses with high light
   levels may induce severe damage to algal symbionts and also damage to
   host foraminifers.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are endangered by constantly rising water temperature due to
   global warming. This triggers a breakdown of the nutritional symbiosis
   between cnidarian hosts and their Symbiodiniaceae symbionts, resulting
   in the loss of the algal partner. In the Symbiodiniaceae exists a high
   genetic diversity with broad physiological plasticity within and between
   species, resulting in large thermal tolerance. While these variations
   have been studied in individual taxa, comprehensive comparative
   experimental data on numerous species are still rare. In the present
   study, the photosynthetic performance and tolerance as function of light
   and temperature of nine Symbiodiniaceae genetic types of four different
   clades were determined. The data indicate significant differences in the
   response patterns. Almost all algal isolates exhibited low to moderate
   light requirements for photosynthesis without photoinhibition, and a
   photosynthetic efficiency between 20 and 80\% in the temperature range
   20-34 degrees C, indicating a broad thermal tolerance to temperature
   fluctuations in tropical regions. The presented data clearly point to a
   broad photophysiological tolerance and thermal plasticity of genetically
   different Symbiodiniaceae, which contributes as an important finding to
   a better understanding of host-symbiont response to an increasing sea
   surface temperature.},

Abstract = {Cold-water coral (CWC) reefs are numerous and widespread along the
   Norwegian continental shelf where oil and gas industry operate.
   Uncertainties exist regarding their impacts from operational discharges
   to drilling. Effect thresholds obtained from near-realistic exposure of
   suspended particle concentrations for use in coral risk modeling are
   particularly needed. Here, nubbins of Desmophyllum pertusum (Lophelia

   particles (bentonite BE; barite BA, and drill cuttings DC) in the range
   of similar to 4 to similar to 60 mg.l(-1) (actual concentration).
   Physiological responses (respiration rate, growth rate, mucus-related
   particulate organic carbon OC and particulate organic nitrogen ON) and
   polyp mortality were then measured 2 and 6 weeks post-exposure to assess
   long-term effects. Respiration and growth rates were not significantly
   different in any of the treatments tested compared to control. OC
   production was not affected in any treatment, but a significant increase
   of OC:ON in mucus produced by BE-exposed (23 and 48 mg.l(-1)) corals was
   revealed 2 weeks after exposure. Polyp mortality increased significantly
   at the two highest DC doses (19 and 49 mg.l(-1)) 2 and 6 weeks
   post-exposure but no significant difference was observed in any of the
   other treatments compared to the control. These findings are adding new
   knowledge on coral resilience to short realistic exposure of suspended
   drill particles and indicate overall a risk for long-term effects at a
   threshold of similar to 20 mg.l(-1).},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Recent research efforts have demonstrated increased bioerosion rates
   under experimentally elevated partial pressures of seawater carbon
   dioxide (pCO(2)) with or without increased temperatures, which may lead
   to net erosion on coral reefs in the future. However, this conclusion
   clearly depends on the ability of the investigated bioeroding organisms
   to survive and grow in the warmer and more acidic future environments,
   which remains unexplored. The excavating sponge Cliona orientalis
   Thiele, is a widely distributed bioeroding organism and symbiotic with
   dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium. Using C. orientalis, an
   energy budget model was developed to calculate amounts of carbon
   directed into metabolic maintenance and growth. This model was tested
   under a range of CO2 emission scenarios (temperature+pCO(2)) appropriate
   to an Austral early summer. Under a pre-industrial scenario, present day
   (control) scenario, or B1 future scenario (associated with reducing the
   rate of CO2 emissions over the next few decades), C. orientalis
   maintained a positive energy budget, where metabolic demand was likely
   satisfied by autotrophic carbon provided by Symbiodinium and
   heterotrophic carbon via filter-feeding, suggesting sustainability.
   Under B1, C. orientalis likely benefited by a greater supply of
   photosynthetic products from its symbionts, which increased by up to
   56\% per unit area, and displayed an improved condition with up to 52\%
   increased surplus carbon available for growth. Under an A1FI future
   scenario (associated with business-as-usual' CO2 emissions) bleached C.
   orientalis experienced the highest metabolic demand, but carbon acquired
   was insufficient to maintain the sponge, as indicated by a negative
   energy budget. These metabolic considerations suggest that previous
   observations of increased bioerosion under A1FI by C. orientalis may not
   last through the height of future A1FI summers, and survival of
   individual sponges may be dependent on the energy reserves (biomass)
   they have accumulated through the rest of the year.},

Abstract = {This study explores the giant oyster Hyotissa hyotis as a novel
   environmental archive in tropical reef environments of the Indo-Pacific.
   The species is a typical accessory component in coral reefs, can reach
   sizes of tens of centimetres, and dates back to the Late Pleistocene.
   Here, a 70.2-mm-long oxygen and carbon isotope transect through the
   shell of a specimen collected at Safaga Bay, northern Red Sea, in May
   1996, is presented. The transect runs perpendicularly to the foliate and
   vesicular layers of the inner ostracum near the ligament area of the
   oyster. The measured delta O-18 and delta C-13 records show sinusoidal
   fluctuations, which are independent of shell microstructure. The delta
   C-13 fluctuations exhibit the same wavelength as the delta O-18
   fluctuations but are phase shifted. The delta O-18 record reflects the
   sea surface temperature variations from 1957 until 1996, possibly
   additionally influenced by the local evaporation. Due to locally
   enhanced evaporation in the semi-enclosed Safaga Bay, the delta
   O-18(seawater) value is estimated at 2.17aEuro degrees, i.e.,
   0.3-0.8aEuro degrees higher than published open surface water delta O-18
   values (1.36-1.85aEuro degrees) from the region. The mean water
   temperature deviates by only 0.4A degrees C from the expected value, and
   the minimum and maximum values are 0.5A degrees C lower and 2.9A degrees
   C higher, respectively. When comparing the mean monthly values, however,
   the sea surface temperature discrepancy between reconstructed and global
   grid datasets is always < 1.0A degrees C. The delta C-13 signal is
   weakly negatively correlated with regional chlorophyll a concentration
   and with the sunshine duration, which may reflect changes in the
   bivalve's respiration. The study emphasises the palaeogeographic context
   in isotope studies based on fossils, because coastal embayments might
   not reflect open-water oceanographic conditions.},

Title = {Drivers of carbon isotopic fractionation in a coral reef lagoon:

Abstract = {The carbon isotopic signature (delta C-13) of coral skeletons is
   influenced by isotopic fractionation (epsilon(org)) during
   photosynthetic dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) fixation, but only a few
   direct epsilon(org) measurements are available in coral communities. In
   particular, observations of epsilon(org) at the ecosystem scale are
   lacking. Here we present high frequency (hourly) measurements of DIC and
   its delta C-13 in the water column and benthic chambers in a highly
   productive coral reef lagoon (Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef,
   Australia) and apply simple molar balance calculations to infer
   community epsilon(org). Variation in epsilon(org) was between 3.7 parts
   per thousand and 25.2 parts per thousand in the open lagoon, with lower
   values during the mid-afternoon and higher values in early morning and
   evening. The epsilon(org) range was broader (0.3-30.1 parts per
   thousand) in enclosed benthic chambers with a similar diel pattern.
   There was a strong correlation between carbon uptake rates and
   epsilon(org) in closed incubations, suggesting that C demand largely
   controlled epsilon(org). Benthic chamber incubations revealed increased
   epsilon(org) as water circulation increased, implying that C supply to
   photosynthesizing algae on the sediment also influenced epsilon(org).
   Hysteresis in carbon uptake through the day complicated the expected
   straightforward influence of irradiance on C demand, and consequently on
   epsilon(org). These results highlight the need for more in depth
   understanding on carbon uptake rates to fully understand delta C-13
   variation in coral paleo-records. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Evaluating the response of organisms to stress assumes that functional
   benchmarks are available against which the response can be gauged, but
   this expectation remains unfulfilled for many taxa. As a result,
   attempts to describe the organismic effects of environmental degradation
   and physiological stress can prove misleading. Functional benchmarks and
   the effects of stress are particularly germane to coral reefs that
   globally are exposed to significant environmental challenges, and in
   this study, we compiled data on scleractinian corals to describe a
   reference against which stress responses can be gauged. Based on this
   construct, we tested the veracity of well-established
   contrasts-involving differences in physiological function among depths
   and families-to evaluate the capacity of available data to support
   synthetic analyses. Our analysis used 126 papers describing 37 genera,
   and at least 73 species, and described 13 traits, first independent of
   depth, and second, by depth. Data appropriate for these analyses were so
   sparse that depth-and family-level effects were inconspicuous, although
   the depth contrast revealed a decline in dark respiration and an
   increase in calcification (both normalized to area) in deeper water. Our
   analyses of scleractinian literature revealed limitations of the data
   available for synthetic analyses, as well for describing functional
   benchmarks within this taxon. We attribute some of these effects to
   differences in the physical environment under which measurements were
   made, and suspect that such problems are commonplace for other taxa.
   Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) models provide one means to overcome some of
   these problems, and they can be used for any taxon to quantitatively
   summarize data for comparative analyses of stressor responses. The
   suitability of these models is illustrated for scleractinian corals by
   predicting from first principles the ratio of Symbiodinium to holobiont
   carbon and the respiration.},

Title = {Coral Reefs on the Edge? Carbon Chemistry on Inshore Reefs of the Great
   Barrier Reef},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 8},
Abstract = {While increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration alters
   global water chemistry (Ocean Acidification; OA), the degree of changes
   vary on local and regional spatial scales. Inshore fringing coral reefs
   of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) are subjected to a variety of local
   pressures, and some sites may already be marginal habitats for corals.
   The spatial and temporal variation in directly measured parameters:
   Total Alkalinity (TA) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)
   concentration, and derived parameters: partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2));
   pH and aragonite saturation state (Omega(ar)) were measured at 14
   inshore reefs over a two year period in the GBR region. Total Alkalinity
   varied between 2069 and 2364 mu mol kg(-1) and DIC concentrations ranged
   from 1846 to 2099 mu mol kg(-1). This resulted in pCO(2) concentrations
   from 340 to 554 mu atm, with higher values during the wet seasons and
   pCO(2) on inshore reefs distinctly above atmospheric values. However,
   due to temperature effects, Omega(ar) was not further reduced in the wet
   season. Aragonite saturation on inshore reefs was consistently lower and
   pCO(2) higher than on GBR reefs further offshore. Thermodynamic effects
   contribute to this, and anthropogenic runoff may also contribute by
   altering productivity (P), respiration (R) and P/R ratios. Compared to
   surveys 18 and 30 years ago, pCO(2) on GBR mid-and outer-shelf reefs has
   risen at the same rate as atmospheric values (similar to 1.7 mu atm
   yr(-1)) over 30 years. By contrast, values on inshore reefs have
   increased at 2.5 to 3 times higher rates. Thus, pCO(2) levels on inshore
   reefs have disproportionately increased compared to atmospheric levels.
   Our study suggests that inshore GBR reefs are more vulnerable to OA and
   have less buffering capacity compared to offshore reefs. This may be
   caused by anthropogenically induced trophic changes in the water column
   and benthos of inshore reefs subjected to land runoff.},

Abstract = {Enhancing the resilience of corals to rising temperatures is now a
   matter of urgency, leading to growing efforts to explore the use of heat
   tolerant symbiont species to improve their thermal resilience. The
   notion that adaptive traits can be retained by transferring the
   symbionts alone, however, challenges the holobiont concept, a
   fundamental paradigm in coral research. Holobiont traits are products of
   a specific community (holobiont) and all its co-evolutionary and local
   adaptations, which might limit the retention or transference of
   holobiont traits by exchanging only one partner. Here we evaluate how
   interchanging partners affect the short- and long-term performance of
   holobionts under heat stress using clonal lineages of the cnidarian
   model system Aiptasia (host and Symbiodiniaceae strains) originating
   from distinct thermal environments. Our results show that holobionts
   from more thermally variable environments have higher plasticity to heat
   stress, but this resilience could not be transferred to other host
   genotypes through the exchange of symbionts. Importantly, our findings
   highlight the role of the host in determining holobiont productivity in
   response to thermal stress and indicate that local adaptations of
   holobionts will likely limit the efficacy of interchanging unfamiliar
   compartments to enhance thermal tolerance.},

Title = {Risks to the stability of coral reefs in the South China Sea: An
   integrated biomarker approach to assess the physiological responses of
   Trochus niloticus to ocean acidification and warming},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {782},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Scientific researches have clearly indicated that ocean acidification
   and warming poses serious threats to coral reef ecosystems. In coral
   reef ecosystems, herbivorous gastropods have an important function in
   maintaining the stability of the ecosystem due to controlling the
   abundance and growth of macroalgal, which compete for nutrients and
   space with coral. However, limited knowledge is available on the
   physiological responses of the specific keystone species to the
   increased ocean acidity and thermal stress. In this study, we evaluated
   the effects of ocean acidification (OA) and warming (OW) on an
   herbivorous gastropod Trochus niloticus commonly found on intertidal and
   shallow subtidal coral reefs in the South China Sea, on the aspect of
   immune responses (total hemocyte counts, reactive oxygen species level
   and apoptosis rate), oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation level,
   antioxidant enzyme activities), neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase
   activity), and energy metabolism (respiration rate and cellular energy
   allocation), after a 28-day exposure experiment to acidic (pH 7.6)
   and/or thermal (30 degrees C) seawater. Our results demonstrated that
   both OA and OW could lead to physiological disturbances of the
   herbivorous top-shells, including impaired immune functions and
   oxidative balance, neurotoxicity, and disorder of energy metabolism.
   Furthermore, results of integrated biomarker response (IBR) confirmed
   that the overall fitness of T. niloticus were deleteriously impacted by
   OA and OW, and were more stressed under the co-exposure condition. These
   results indicated that increased acidity and temperature in the future
   ocean might impair the viability of T. niloticus in the long-run, which
   will indulge the proliferation of macroalgae and lead to degradation of
   the coral reef ecosystem. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We investigated heterogeneity of light acclimation of photosynthesis in
   sun- and shade-adapted coenosarc and polyp tissues of Pocillopora
   damicornis. The zooxanthellar community within P. damicornis colonies at
   Heron Island is genetically uniform, yet they showed a large degree of
   plasticity in their photo-physiological acclimation linked to light
   microclimates characterised by fibre-optic microprobes. Microscale
   scalar irradiance measurements showed higher absorption in polyp than
   coenosarc tissues and higher absorption in the more densely pigmented
   shade-adapted polyps than in sun-adapted polyps. The combination of an
   O-2 microelectrode with a fibre-optic microprobe (combined sensor
   diameter 50-100 mu m) enabled parallel measurements of O-2
   concentration, gross photosynthesis rate and photosystem II (PSII)
   quantum yield at the coral surface under steady-state conditions as a
   function of increasing irradiances. Lower O-2 levels at the tissue
   surface and higher compensation irradiance indicated a higher
   respiration activity in sun-adapted polyp tissue as compared to
   shade-adapted polyps. Shade-adapted coenosarc and polyp tissues
   exhibited lower maxima of relative electron transport rates (rETR(max))
   (84 +/- 15 and 41 +/- 10, respectively) than sun-adapted coenosarc and
   polyp tissues (136 +/- 14 and 77 +/- 13, respectively). Shade-adapted
   tissues showed stronger decrease of rETR at high scalar irradiances as
   compared to sun-adapted tissues. The relationship between the relative
   PSII electron transport and the rate of gross photosynthesis, as well as
   O-2 concentration, was non-linear in sun-adapted tissues over the entire
   irradiance range, whereas for shade-adapted tissues the relationship
   became non-linear at medium to high scalar irradiances > 200 mu mol
   photons m(-2) s(-1). This suggests that rETR measurements should be used
   with caution in corals as a proxy for photosynthesis rates. The
   apparently high rates of photosynthesis (oxygen evolution rates) suggest
   that there must be a considerable electron transport rate through the
   photosystems that is not observed by the rETR measurements. This may be
   accounted for by vertical heterogeneity of zooxanthellae in the tissue
   and the operation of an alternative electron pathway such as cyclic
   electron flow around PSII.},

Abstract = {In the past few years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number
   of studies revealing negative or positive effects of ocean acidification
   on marine organisms including corals, echinoderms, copepods, molluscs,
   and fish. However, scavenging gastropods have received little attention
   despite being major players in energy flow, removing carrion, and
   recycling materials in marine benthic communities. The present study
   investigated the physiological responses (ingestion, absorption rate and
   efficiency, respiration, and excretion) and scope for growth (SfG) of an
   intertidal scavenging gastropod, Nassarius festivus, to the combined
   effects of ocean acidification (pCO(2) levels: 380, 950, and 1250 mu
   atm), salinity (10 and 30 psu), and temperature (15 and 30 degrees C)
   for 31 d. Low salinity (10 psu) reduced ingestion, absorption rate,
   respiration, excretion, and SfG of N. festivus throughout the exposure
   period. Low temperature (15 degrees C) had a similar effect on these
   parameters, except for SfG at the end of the exposure period (31 d).
   However, elevated pCO(2) levels had no effects in isolation on all
   physiological parameters and only weak interactions with temperature
   and/or salinity for excretion and SfG. In conclusion, elevated pCO(2)
   will not affect the energy budget of adult N. festivus at the pCO(2)

Abstract = {The capture efficiency and feeding behaviour of the cold-water coral
   (CWC) Lophelia pertusa (Linnaeus, 1758) were investigated considering:
   (1) different food types, (2) different food sizes and (3) different
   current speeds and temperatures. This study used two different
   multifactorial experimental approaches: (1) Corals were subjected to
   three different flow speeds (2, 5 and 10 cm s(-1)) in 51 volume tanks,
   and three different food types (alive zooplankton, alive algae, and dry
   particulate organic carbon) were offered to the corals under each
   current regime, analysing the capture rates of the corals under these
   different flow velocities. (2) In a flume, the feeding behaviour of the
   coral polyps was studied under different current speed regimes (1, 7, 15
   and 27 cm s-1) and a temperature change over a range of 8-12 degrees C.
   The obtained results confirm that low flow speeds (below 7 cm s-1)
   appear optimal for a successful prey capture, and temperature did not
   have an effect on polyp expansion behaviour for L. pertusa. In
   conclusion, flow speeds clearly impact food capture efficiency in L
   pertusa, with zooplankton predominantly captured prey at low flow
   velocities (2 cm s(-1)) and phytoplankton captured at higher flow
   velocities of 5 cm s(-1). This split in capture efficiency may allow
   corals to exploit different food sources under different tidal and flow
   conditions. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Simple Summary Coral reefs are important habitats for marine life and
   have high commercial uses, which can be used in biomedicine, aquariums
   and tourism promotion. In recent years, climate change has posed a
   serious threat to coral survival. Therefore, it is very important to
   explore the effects of temperature and salinity changes on coral
   physiology. In addition to understanding the threat of climate change to
   corals, it can also be used as an important environmental indicator for
   coral large-scale aquaculture. This study aims to investigate the
   effects of different temperatures and salinity on the body composition,
   digestive enzymes and metabolism of G. columna, to explore the
   physiological and metabolic threats caused by climate change to G.
   columna, and to understand the most suitable temperature and salinity
   for G. columna growth. Climate change is causing dramatic changes in
   global ocean temperature and salinity, threatening coral survival. Coral
   growth and metabolism are greatly affected by the temperature, salinity
   and feeding time of the environment. In order to explore the threats to
   coral survival caused by climate change, this study will investigate the
   changes in body composition, digestive enzymes and metabolism of G.
   columna at different temperatures and salinities. A maximum G. columna
   growth rate was observed at 25 degrees C and 30-35 psu salinity. The G.
   columna could survive in a wide salinity range of 25-40 psu. However,
   the maximum number and weight of G. columna polyps was determined at
   30-35 psu. Furthermore, 30-35 psu salinity at 25 degrees C led to the
   best G. columna growth and survival, mainly because of their enhanced
   nutrient absorption rate, polyp expansion rate, metabolic rate and
   adaptability. Comparing various salinity-temperature treatment groups,
   all obtained values for growth, behavior and metabolism were
   significantly higher (p < 0.05) for 30 psu at 25 degrees C than other
   treatment groups resulting in maximum G. columna yield. In addition, the
   optimal timing of G. columna feeding was assessed by studying changes in
   body composition and digestive enzymes within 24 h of feeding. The

Abstract = {Preconditioning to non-stressful warming can protect some symbiotic
   cnidarians against the high temperature-induced collapse of their
   mutualistic endosymbiosis with photosynthetic dinoflagellates
   (Symbiodinium spp.), a process known as bleaching. Here, we sought to
   determine whether such preconditioning is underpinned by differential
   regulation of aerobic respiration. We quantified in vivo metabolism and
   mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activity in the naturally symbiotic sea
   anemone Exaiptasia pallida preconditioned to 30 degrees C for > 7 weeks
   as well as anemones kept at 26 degrees C. Preconditioning resulted in
   increased Symbiodinium photosynthetic activity and holobiont (host+
   symbiont) respiration rates. Biomassnormalised activities of host
   respiratory enzymes {[}citrate synthase and the mitochondrial electron
   transport chain (mETC) complexes I and IV] were higher in preconditioned
   animals, suggesting that increased holobiont respiration may have been
   due to host mitochondrial biogenesis and/or enlargement. Subsequent
   acute heating of preconditioned and ` thermally naive' animals to 33
   degrees C induced dramatic increases in host mETC complex I and
   Symbiodinium mETC complex II activities only in thermally naive E.
   pallida. These changes were not reflected in the activities of other
   respiratory enzymes. Furthermore, bleaching in preconditioned E. pallida
   (defined as the significant loss of symbionts) was delayed by several
   days relative to the thermally naive group. These findings suggest that
   changes to mitochondrial biogenesis and/or function in symbiotic
   cnidarians during warm preconditioning might play a protective role
   during periods of exposure to stressful heating.},

Title = {Microphytobenthos community production at a near-shore coral reef:
   seasonal variation and response to ammonium recycled by holothurians},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {169},
Pages = {1-11},
Abstract = {Production of the microphytobenthos community of a near-shore reef in
   the Great Barrier Reef system was measured on 7 occasions over 13 mo
   using in situ respirometry with dome chambers. In addition, underwater
   light levels were recorded, which allowed the construction of in situ
   production-irradiance (P-I) curves for these sediment communities.
   During all months the community was distinctly autotrophic, with 24 h
   production to respiration (P/R) ratios ranging from 2.9 to 4.4. We
   estimated an annual community net-production of 168 g C m(-2). hll
   parameters expressing the overall magnitude of production (community net
   and gross production; photosynthetic capacity, P-max) showed distinctly
   lower values in winter, indicating a strong seasonality. Between 63 and
   75\% of the variation of these parameters was explained by seasonal
   changes in temperature. Most other P-I curve parameters (light
   compensation point, I-c; light saturation point, I-k; photosynthetic
   efficiency, alpha) showed less obvious long term temporal patterns and
   were subject to large variation between single measuring days. A
   considerable proportion of the variation in I-c, I-k and cc (46 to
   68\%)could be attributed to daily differences in underwater light
   conditions,indicating rapid photoadaptation by the microalgal
   communities to variation in light conditions due to turbidity and/or
   cloud cover. In in situ enrichment experiments the excretion of
   holothurians enhanced community net production and P-max by about 1.2\%.
   The enhancement most likely resulted from a rise of NH4+ concentration
   (0.1 mu mol l(-1) above the background level). The enhancement due to
   holothurian excretion products, in conjunction with the low quantum
   yield efficiency exhibited by the benthic community, indicate that
   production of benthic microalgae in our study area was limited by the
   availability of inorganic nitrogen.},

Abstract = {Benthic dissolved oxygen fluxes were measured on the reef flat of Tallon
   Island, an intertidal reef platform in the Kimberley region of
   northwestern Australia, for periods of 2 weeks in the wet and dry
   seasons. This reef flat is strongly tidally forced by semidiurnal tides
   (spring range > 8 m) and experiences highly asymmetric water level
   variability, with ebb durations lasting similar to 10 h; this results in
   diel variations in water temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO)
   concentration (up to similar to 11 degrees C and 440 mu M, respectively)
   that are among the most extreme recorded for reefs worldwide. Given the
   consistent tidal flow patterns, a one-dimensional control volume
   approach was used to make continuous Eulerian measurements of net
   production and community respiration from observed changes in DO within
   two zones: an inner zone dominated by seagrass and an outer zone
   dominated by macroalgae. Community respiration (R) was controlled
   primarily by DO concentration; however, fluxes approached the limits of
   DO mass transfer at low flow speeds. Estimates of gross primary
   production (P) suggested that reef communities were able to fix carbon
   at rates comparable to other tropical seagrass and mixed reef flat
   communities despite short-term (similar to hours) extremes in light (up
   to 1800 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and temperature (> 35 degrees C). Daily net
   community production fluctuated between net autotrophy and heterotrophy
   over a similar to 15 d period depending on the phase difference between
   the solar and tidal cycles but was nonetheless metabolically balanced on
   time scales greater than weeks (P : R = 1.0-1.1).},

Abstract = {Algal symbiont-bearing benthic foraminifera are producers of both
   organic and inorganic carbon in coral-reef ecosystems. However, their
   contribution to the total budget of reef carbon production has not been
   adequately quantified. We used O-2-respirometry and alkalinity-anomaly
   techniques to estimate the organic and inorganic carbon production rates
   of three species of symbiont-bearing large foraminifera common to coral
   reef flats in the northwest Pacific Ocean. The species studied were
   Baculogypsina sphaerulata and Calearina gaudichaudii, which both harbor
   diatom endosymbionts, and Marginopora kudakajimensis, which harbors
   dinoflagellate endosymbionts. Live mature individuals were placed onto
   mesh in clear airtight containers filled with filtered seawater. The
   containers were incubated for several hours at a constant temperature
   and subjected to different levels of light intensity. Seawater was
   continuously mixed throughout the experiment. Dissolved oxygen, pH and
   total alkalinity were measured before and after incubation. Three
   species of larger benthic foraminifera were net organic and inorganic
   carbon producers. The P/R ratio exceeded 1 for all species. No
   photoinhibition was observed up to 1500 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), and
   calcification was enhanced by light. These findings suggest that the
   three species are net carbon producers adapted to high-light, reef-flat
   environments. In addition, we calculated that Baculogypsina sphaerulata
   and C. gaudichaudii together accounted for 2-7.5\% of the gross primary
   production of a reef-crest community, whereas M. kudakajimensis supplied
   1-11\% of the gross primary production of a backreef community. The two
   calcarinids and M. kudakajimensis contributed similar to 1 and 10\% of
   the inorganic carbon production of seaward reef flat and protected
   lagoon communities, respectively. Together with previous reports, these
   estimates suggest that algal symbiont-bearing foraminifera play a minor
   but essential role in the organic and inorganic carbon production of
   coral-reef ecosystems.},

Title = {SUBTIDAL BENTHIC COMMUNITY RESPIRATION AND PRODUCTION NEAR THE HEAVILY
   OILED GULF-COAST OF SAUDI-ARABIA},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {27},
Pages = {199-205},
Abstract = {As part of the NOAA/ROPME/MSRC sponsored assessment of the coast of
   Saudi Arabia, heavily impacted by the large oil spills of the 1991 Gulf
   War, we measured benthic community respiration (R) and primary
   production (P) rates in shallow subtidal basins near heavily oiled
   coastlines. Study sites were located in zones predicted to be basins of
   maximum deposition of any oiled sediments likely to wash off the
   adjacent coast and in reference bays predicted to be clean and
   unaffected. We measured oxygen exchange using in situ benthic
   respirometers and analysed petroleum hydrocarbon (PHC) levels in the
   near surface sediments at five stations. We concentrated our efforts in
   mud habitats to complement related studies in seagrass habitats.
   Measured community R rates ranged from a low of 700 muM m2 h-1 in coarse
   sand sediments with total organic carbon content (TOC) of only 0.16\% of
   dry wt to the highest rate of 2184 mum m-2 h-1 in finer mud-sand
   habitats with 0.39\% TOC. All measured rates were in the range of
   literature values for shallow marine sediments at temperatures of 17 to
   19-degrees-C. Sediment oil content was 13-540 mug g-1 dry wt by
   ultraviolet fluorescence (UVF) analysis and 0.5-103 mug g-1 by gas
   chromatography (GC). Benthic P rates, calculated as light minus dark
   changes in dissolved oxygen, ranged from a low of 1162 mum m-2 h-1 at
   the most heavily oiled site to a high of 5216 mum m-2 h-1 at less oiled
   sites. While a weak inverse relationship between benthic P and sediment
   oil content was not significant statistically due to the small number of
   samples, a significant inverse relationship was found between the ratio
   of production to respiration (P/R) and the total petroleum content of
   the sediments by UVF. The effect appears to be driven more by
   differences in production than an effect on respiration which showed
   little relationship with either oil content or productivity. We conclude
   that within 1 year after the oil grounded on the intertidal sands of
   Saudi Arabia, the levels of oil in subtidal benthic sediments had
   decreased in most habitats to levels that did not show community stress
   by our oxygen measurements. Rather, long term damage to benthic subtidal
   habitats was limited only to enclosed bays adjacent to the most heavily
   oiled coastlines. Preliminary estimates of yearly P converted to carbon
   units indicates that the shallow mud sediments of the Gulf are at least
   as productive as most oligotrophic water columns. Since benthic habitats
   covered by seagrass, algae beds or coral reefs are likely to have even
   higher production rates, we conclude that benthic processes contribute
   significantly to the overall carbon flux in the Gulf ecosystem.},

   along Oxygen and Nutrient Gradients: Environmental Controls and
   Biogeochemical Feedbacks within and across ``Marine Lakes{''}},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {Declining ocean oxygen content driven by anthropogenic climate change
   has wide-ranging ramifications for marine ecosystems. These effects are
   significant but complex at the upper margins of expanding oxygen minimum
   zones (OMZs), where deoxygenation, and biogeochemical feedbacks to low
   dissolved oxygen (DO) are regulated by biological production and
   consumption of DO via gross primary production (GPP) and community
   respiration (CR). We used ``marine lakes-bodies of seawater surrounded
   by land as a natural experimental system for examining the environmental
   factors that dictate coupling and de-coupling between GPP and CR.
   Distinct gradients in DO (from fully oxygenated to anoxic conditions),
   temperature, light, quantity, and quality of organic matter, presence of
   key nutrients, and microbial community structure occur across multiple
   stratified meromictic lakes and well-mixed holomictic marine lakes
   present in Palau. We found consistently high GPP rates in stratified
   meromictic lakes (>10 mmol O-2 m(-3) d(-1)) especially near the
   chemocline, where nutrients diffuse upwards from anoxic waters and a
   wider range of rates in well-mixed lakes (0.350-57.9 mmol O-2 m(-3)
   d(-1)). In contrast to GPP, CR rates were typically lower and less
   variable across different depths and lakes. Most depths in most lakes
   were therefore net autotrophic {[}i.e., net community production (NCR) >
   0]. However, experimental additions of ammonium (5 mu M) and labile
   organic carbon (100 OM had strong effects on CR, resulting in (i)
   several-fold increases in CR, (ii) larger increases in CR in meromictic
   lakes with chemoclines near the surface, and (iii) the occurrence of net
   heterotrophy and DO consumption. Our results are indicative of several
   biogeochemical feedback mechanisms to deoxygenation present at the upper
   margins of shoaling OMZs that are governed by nutrient turnover. In
   marine lakes, these feedbacks can have strong effects on nutrient uptake
   and the production and consumption of oxygen, with implications for
   carbon, nutrient, and oxygen cycling throughout large areas of the
   ocean.},

Title = {Response of Subtropical Coastal Sediment Systems of Okinawa, Japan, to
   Experimental Warming and High pCO(2)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {Increasing seawater temperatures and CO2 levels associated with climate
   change affect the shallow marine ecosystem function. In this study, the
   effects of elevated seawater temperature and partial pressure of CO2
   (pCO(2)) on subtropical sediment systems of mangrove, seagrass, and
   coral reef lagoon habitats of Okinawa, Japan, were examined. Sediment
   and seawater from each habitat were exposed to four pCO(2)-temperature
   treatments, including ambient pCO(2)- ambient temperature, ambient
   pCO(2)-high temperature (ambient temperature + 4 degrees C), high pCO(2)
   (936 ppm)-ambient temperature, and high pCO(2)-high temperature.
   Parameters including primary production, nutrient flux, pigment content,
   photosynthetic community composition, and bacterial abundance were
   examined. Neither high temperature nor high pCO(2) alone impacted
   mangrove and seagrass sediment primary production significantly (Tukey's
   test, P > 0.05). However, the combined stress significantly (Tukey's
   test, P < 0.01) increased primary production in these two habitats. In
   sediments from the coral reef lagoon, single and combined stress
   treatments induced a shift from heterotrophy to autotrophy. Significant
   increases in net primary production (Tukey's test, P < 0.01), and gross
   primary production (Tukey's test, P < 0.05) under the combined stress
   suggested that benthic microalgae in mangrove and seagrass sediments
   were more responsive to high temperature and pCO(2) conditions than
   those in coral reef lagoon sediments. Additionally, combined stress
   significantly increased the sediment chlorophyll a content (Tukey's
   test, P < 0.05) in all habitats. These increases were associated with
   increased net primary production, indicating that combined stress
   stimulates primary production activity by the photosynthetic benthic
   microalgae in all habitats. Diatom activity increased, as silicate
   uptake increased in all habitats. Microbial abundance significantly
   increased under the combined stress treatment (Tukey's test, P < 0.01),
   but did not exceed autotrophic activity. Respiration did not change
   significantly in any of the three habitats (Tukey's test, P > 0.05)
   under the combined stress, suggesting that heterotrophic processes were
   less affected by the combined stress than autotrophic processes. In
   summary, mangrove and seagrass sediments minimize the negative impacts
   of elevated temperature and pCO(2) via increased primary production and
   carbon storage. Lagoonal sediments also act as a carbon sink under
   temperature and ocean acidificationstress.},

Abstract = {For the first time oxygen consumption and spontaneous activity of 16
   individuals of stonefish Synanceia verrucosa were determined
   simultaneously. The experiments were conducted in an intermittent-flow
   respirometer at 25 degrees C, and salinity (PSU 32). Continuous
   measurements of fish activity and oxygen consumption were combined in
   order to calculate routine (RMR) and standard metabolic rate (SMR) and

   Absolute SMR for a standard mass of 100 g was calculated to be 3.58 mg

   {[}mg O-2 h(-1)] = 0.0643{*}WM {[}g] (0.873). The investigated stonefish
   is so far the most motionless fish found in coral reef/mangrove areas,

Abstract = {Sponges are major components of benthic communities across the world and
   have been identified as potential ``winners{''} on coral reefs in the
   face of global climate change as result of their tolerance to ocean
   warming and acidification (OA). Previous studies have also hypothesised
   that photosymbiont-containing sponges might have higher productivity
   under future OA conditions as a result of photosymbionts having
   increased access to CO2 and subsequently greater carbon production. Here
   we test this hypothesis for a widespread and abundant
   photosymbiont-containing sponge species Lamellodysidea herbacea at a CO2
   seep in Papua New Guinea simulating OA conditions. We found seep sponges
   had relatively higher cyanobacterial abundance, chlorophyll
   concentrations and symbiont photosynthetic efficiency than non-seep
   sponges, and a three-fold higher sponge abundance at the seep site.
   However, while gross oxygen production was the same for seep and
   non-seep sponges, seep sponge dark respiration rates were higher and
   instantaneous photosynthesis: respiration (P:R) ratios were lower. We
   show that while photosymbiont containing sponges may not have increased
   productivity under OA, they are able to show flexibility in their
   relationships with microbes and offset increased metabolic costs
   associated with climate change associated stress.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {88},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {65-80},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In light of an increasing trend in fish biology towards using static
   respirometry techniques without the inclusion of a mixing mechanism and
   without accurately accounting for the influence of microbial
   (background) respiration, this paper quantifies the effect of these
   approaches on the oxygen consumption rates (MO2) measured from juvenile
   barramundi Lates calcarifer (mean +/- s.e. mass = 2031 +/- 081 g) and
   adult spiny chromis damselfish Acanthochromis polyacanthus (2203 +/- 253
   g). Background respiration changed consistently and in a sigmoidal
   manner over time in the treatment with a mixing device (inline
   recirculation pump), whereas attempts to measure background respiration
   in the non-mixed treatment yielded highly variable estimates of MO2 that
   were probably artefacts due to the lack of water movement over the
   oxygen sensor during measurement periods. This had clear consequences
   when accounting for background respiration in the calculations of fish
   MO2. Exclusion of a mixing device caused a significantly lower estimate
   of MO2 in both species and reduced the capacity to detect differences
   between individuals as well as differences within an individual over
   time. There was evidence to suggest that the magnitude of these effects
   was dependent on the spontaneous activity levels of the fish, as the
   difference between mixed and non-mixed treatments was more pronounced
   for L. calcarifer (sedentary) than for A. polyacanthus (more
   spontaneously active). It is clear that respirometry set-ups for
   sedentary species must contain a mixing device to prevent oxygen
   stratification inside the respirometer. While more active species may
   provide a higher level of water mixing during respirometry measurements
   and theoretically reduce the need for a mixing device, the level of
   mixing cannot be quantified and may change with diurnal cycles in
   activity. To ensure consistency across studies without relying on fish
   activity levels, and to enable accurate assessments of background
   respiration, it is recommended that all respirometry systems should
   include an appropriate mixing device.},

Abstract = {We report seasonal water column carbonate chemistry data collected over
   a three-year period (late 2013 to 2016) at Flower Garden Banks National
   Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS) located on the subtropical shelf edge of the
   northwestern Gulf of Mexico. The FGBNMS hosts the northernmost tropical
   coral species in the contiguous United States, with over 50\% living
   coral cover. Presented here are results from samples of the upper 25 m
   of the water column collected from September 2013 to November 2016.
   Additionally, following a localized mortality event likely associated
   with major continental flooding in summer 2016, water samples from up to
   similar to 250 m depth were collected in the broader FGBNMS area on a
   rapid response cruise to examine the seawater carbonate system. Both
   surface (< 5 m) total alkalinity (TA) and total dissolved inorganic
   carbon (DIC) vary over small ranges (2391 +/- 19 mu mol kg(-1) and 2060
   +/- 19 mu mol kg(-1), respectively) for all times-series samples.
   Temperature and salinity both played an important role in controlling
   the surface water carbonate system dynamics, although temperature was
   the sole significant factor when there was no flooding. The FGBNMS area
   acted as a sink for atmospheric CO2 in winter and a CO2 source in
   summer, while the time-integrated CO2 flux is close to zero (- 0.14 +/-
   1.96 mmol-C m(-2) yr(-1)). Results from three cruises, i.e., the Gulf of
   Mexico and East Coast Carbon Project (GOMECC-1) in 2007, the rapid
   response study, and the Gulf of Mexico Ecosystems and Carbon Cruise
   (GOMECC-3), revealed decreases in both pH and saturation state with
   respect to aragonite (Omega(arag)) in subsurface waters (similar to
   100-250 m) over time. These decreases are larger than those observed in
   other tropical and subtropical waters. Based on reaction stoichiometry,
   calculated anthropogenic CO2 contributed 30-41\% of the overall DIC
   increase, while elevated respiration accounted for the rest.},

Abstract = {Respiration of organic material is a central process in the global
   carbon (C) cycle catalysed by diverse microbial communities. In the
   coastal ocean, upwelling can drive variation in both community
   respiration (CR) and the microbial community, but linkages between the
   two are not well-understood. We measured CR rates and analysed microbial
   dynamics via 16S rRNA gene sequencing, to assess whether CR correlated
   with upwelling irrespective of changes in the microbial community, or if
   the particular microbial community present was a factor in explaining
   variations in CR. CR varied significantly over time as a function of
   temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO) and chlorophyllall of which are
   altered by upwellingbut also varied with a subnetwork' (i.e., a group of
   microbial taxa that covaried with one another) of the whole community.
   One subnetwork was associated with higher CR and warmer temperatures,
   while another was associated with lower CR and DO. Our results suggest
   that CR in the coastal ocean varies with both environmental variables,
   and a portion of the microbial community that is not directly correlated
   with upwelling intensity.},

Abstract = {Coral reef lagoons have generally been regarded as sinks for organic
   matter exported from more productive reef front and reef flat zones. The
   object of this study was to examine the importance of detritus as a
   carbon source for benthic communities in the lagoon at Davies Reef,
   central Great Barrier Reef. We report the results of seasonal
   measurements, taken in 1986, of bacterial numbers and production,
   protozoan numbers, community primary production and respiration in the
   sediments of Davies Reef lagoon. Deposition rates of organic matter in
   the lagoon were also measured. Deposition rates (+/- 1 SE) of carbon
   ranged from 9.2 (+/- 1.5) to 140.7 (+/- 10.3) mg Cm-2 d-1. Deposition
   rates were highest in winter and spring, lowest in summer. Rates of
   bacterial production ranged from 4.7 (+/- 0.2) pmol thymidine
   in-corporated g-1 dry wt (DW) h-1 in winter to 23.5 (+/- 1.0) pmol
   thymidine incorporated g-1 DW h-1 in spring. The number of ciliates
   ranged from 65 (+/- 10) to 356 (+/- 50) cm-3 through the year and the
   number of large (greater-than-or-equal-20-mu-m) flagellates from 38 (+/-
   7) to 108 (+/- 16) There were no clear relationships between the
   sediment organic content, detrital input or temperature and the rates of
   bacterial processes, community metabolism or the standing stocks of
   microbes in the lagoon. The relative significance of detritus and in
   situ primary production as sources of carbon in the lagoon varied with
   season. In summer and autumn, detritus was less important than primary
   production as a source of carbon (4 to 27\% of total carbon input). In
   winter and spring, detritus input became more significant in supply of
   carbon to the sediments (32 to 67\% of the total carbon input). The
   lagoon does not simply act as a sink for carbon exported from the reef
   flat. We calculate that only 5\% of the net reef flat primary production
   reached lagoon sediments in summer, but nearly 40\% in winter.},

Abstract = {An array of MAPCO(2) buoys, CRIMP-2, Ala Wai, and Kilo Nalu, deployed in
   the coastal waters of Hawaii, have produced multi-year high temporal
   resolution CO2 records in three different coral reef environments off
   the island of Oahu, Hawaii. This study, which includes data from June
   2008 to December 2011, is part of an integrated effort to understand the
   factors that influence the dynamics of CO2-carbonic acid system
   parameters in waters surrounding Pacific high-island coral reef
   ecosystems and subject to differing natural and anthropogenic stresses.
   The MAPCO(2) buoys are located on the Kaneohe Bay backreef, and fringing
   reef sites on the south shore of Oahu, Hawaii. The buoys measure CO2 and
   O-2 in seawater and in the atmosphere at 3-h intervals, as well as other
   physical and biogeochemical parameters (conductivity, temperature,
   depth, chlorophyll- a, and turbidity). The buoy records, combined with
   data from synoptic spatial sampling, have allowed us to examine the
   interplay between biological cycles of productivity/ respiration and
   calcification/dissolution and biogeochemical and physical forcings on
   hourly to inter-annual time scales. Air-sea CO2 gas exchange was also
   calculated to determine whether the locations were sources or sinks of
   CO2 over seasonal, annual, and interannual time periods. Net annualized
   fluxes for CRIMP-2, Ala Wai, and Kilo Nalu over the entire study period
   were 1.15, 0.045, and -0.0056 mol C m(-2) year(-1), respectively, where
   positive values indicate a source or a CO2 flux from the water to the
   atmosphere, and negative values indicate a sink or flux of CO2 from the
   atmosphere into the water. These values are of similar magnitude to
   previous estimates in Kaneohe Bay as well as those reported from other
   tropical reef environments. Total alkalinity (A(T)) was measured in
   conjunction with pCO(2), and the carbonic acid system was calculated to
   compare with other reef systems and open ocean values around Hawaii.
   These findings emphasize the need for high-resolution data of multiple
   parameters when attempting to characterize the carbonic acid system in
   locations of highly variable physical, chemical, and biological
   parameters (e.g., coastal systems and reefs).},

Abstract = {The delta O-18, delta C-13 and trace element composition of pearls
   collected from Ago Bay, Japan, were investigated in order to evaluate
   biomineralization in the cultured pearl oyster (Pinctada fucata
   martensii). The oxygen isotopic data suggest that the pearls were
   produced around 23-24 degrees C, mainly in June to early July, which is
   consistent with their occurrence in the field. Therefore the pearls were
   produced under or close to isotopic equilibrium conditions, although
   they showed high calcification rates (higher than 0.2-1.0 g cm(-2)
   yr(-1)) under which, for example, coral skeletons (calcification rate
   similar to 0.28 g cm(-2) yr(-1)) often show non-equilibrium isotope
   partitioning. The delta C-13 values were similar to-2.9 parts per
   thousand lower than those calculated for offshore waters under
   equilibrium conditions. This may be due to low-delta C-13 bottom waters
   resulting from the degradation of organic matter (OM) or to a
   contribution of low-delta C-13 food. In the latter case, a simple mass
   balance calculation gives a respiration component of 14\%. Twelve trace
   elements of bulk pearl samples were classified into four groups on the
   basis of their enrichment/depletion patterns relative to seawater and
   inter-element relationships: group 1, Co, Cr, Ph; group 2, Ba, Cs, U;
   group 3, Cu, Sn, V, and group 4, Mn, Rb, Mo. Comparison with coral
   skeletons suggests that Ba and Mn (groups 2 and 4) were definitely much
   enriched in proteinaceous OM relative to aragonite crystals in pearls
   and that V (group 3) in pearls showed only slight enrichment in the
   organic-rich layer. By contrast, the other elements showed small
   differences between both layers (enrichment factor of < 3), suggesting
   that these elements occur largely in aragonite crystals.},

Abstract = {According to current experimental evidence, coral reefs could disappear
   within the century if CO2 emissions remain unabated. However, recent
   discoveries of diverse and high cover reefs that already live under
   extreme conditions suggest that some corals might thrive well under hot,
   high-pCO(2), and deoxygenated seawater. Volcanic CO2 vents,
   semi-enclosed lagoons, and mangrove estuaries are unique study sites
   where one or more ecologically relevant parameters for life in the
   oceans are close to or even worse than currently projected for the year
   2100. Although they do not perfectly mimic future conditions, these
   natural laboratories offer unique opportunities to explore the
   mechanisms that reef species could use to keep pace with climate change.
   To achieve this, it is essential to characterize their environment as a
   whole and accurately consider all possible environmental factors that
   may differ from what is expected in the future, possibly altering the
   ecosystem response.
   This study focuses on the semi-enclosed lagoon of Bourake (New
   Caledonia, southwest Pacific Ocean) where a healthy reef ecosystem
   thrives in warm, acidified, and deoxygenated water. We used a
   multi-scale approach to characterize the main physical-chemical
   parameters and mapped the benthic community composition (i.e., corals,
   sponges, and macroalgae). The data revealed that most physical and
   chemical parameters are regulated by the tide, strongly fluctuate three
   to four times a day, and are entirely predictable. The seawater pH and
   dissolved oxygen decrease during falling tide and reach extreme low
   values at low tide (7.2 pH(T) and 1.9 mg O-2 L-1 at Bourake vs. 7.9
   pH(T) and 5.5 mg O-2 L(-1 )at reference reefs). Dissolved oxygen,
   temperature, and pH fluctuate according to the tide by up to 4.91 mg O-2
   L-1, 6.50 degrees C, and 0.69 pH(T) units on a single day. Furthermore,
   the concentration of most of the chemical parameters was 1 to 5 times
   higher at the Bourake lagoon, particularly for organic and inorganic
   carbon and nitrogen but also for some nutrients, notably silicates.
   Surprisingly, despite extreme environmental conditions and altered
   seawater chemical composition measured at Bourake, our results reveal a
   diverse and high cover community of macroalgae, sponges, and corals
   accounting for 28, 11, and 66 species, respectively. Both environmental
   variability and nutrient imbalance might contribute to their survival
   under such extreme environmental conditions. We describe the natural
   dynamics of the Bourake ecosystem and its relevance as a natural
   laboratory to investigate the benthic organism's adaptive responses to
   multiple extreme environmental conditions.},

Abstract = {Adaptation, acclimatization and symbiont diversity are known to regulate
   thermal tolerance in corals, but the role of these mechanisms remains
   poorly constrained in other photosymbioses, such as large benthic
   foraminifera (LBFs), which are known to bleach at temperatures that are
   likely to be exceeded in the near future. LBFs inhabit a broad range of
   shallow-water settings. Within species, differences in thermal tolerance
   have been found among populations from different habitats, but it is not
   clear whether such differences occur among LBFs inhabiting similar
   habitats, but differing in other aspects, such as symbiont type. To this
   end, we compared responses to thermal stress in specimens from a
   population of Amphistegina lessonii, an abundant Indo-Pacific species,
   to specimens of Amphistegina gibbosa, its Atlantic counter-part, from a
   similar environment but two different water depths (5 and 18 m). Test
   groups of each species were exposed in a common experiment to three
   thermal stress scenarios over a four-week period. Growth, respiration,
   mortality and motility were measured to characterize the holobiont
   response. Coloration, photosynthesis and chlorophyll a content were
   measured to determine the response of the endosymbiotic diatoms. The
   photosymbionts were characterized by genetic fingerprinting. Our results
   show that, although groups of A. gibbosa were collected from different
   habitats, their responses were similar, indicating only marginally
   higher tolerance to thermal peaks in specimens from the shallower site.
   In contrast, species-specific differences were stronger, with A.
   lessonii showing higher tolerance to episodic stress and less pronounced
   impacts of chronic stress on motility, growth and photosymbiont
   performance. These interspecies variations are consistent with the
   presence of different and more diverse symbiont assemblages in A.
   lessonii compared with A. gibbosa. This study demonstrates the
   importance of considering symbiont diversity in the assessment of infra-
   and interspecific variations in stress responses in LBFs.},

Abstract = {The singular and interactive effects of ocean acidification and
   temperature on the physiology of calcified green algae (Halimeda
   incrassata, H. opuntia, and H. simulans) were investigated in a fully
   factorial, 4-week mesocosm experiment. Individual aquaria replicated
   treatment combinations of two pH levels (7.6 and 8.0) and two
   temperatures (28 and 31 A degrees C). Rates of photosynthesis,
   respiration, and calcification were measured for all species both prior
   to and after treatment exposure. Pre-treatment measurements revealed
   that H. incrassata displayed higher biomass-normalized rates of
   photosynthesis and calcification (by 55 and 81 \%, respectively)
   relative to H. simulans and H. opuntia. Furthermore, prior to treatment
   exposure, photosynthesis was positively correlated to calcification,
   suggesting that the latter process may be controlled by photosynthetic
   activity in this group. After treatment exposure, net photosynthesis was
   unaltered by pH, yet significantly increased with elevated temperature
   by 58, 38, and 37 \% for H. incrassata, H. simulans, and H. opuntia,
   respectively. Both pH and temperature influenced calcification, but in
   opposing directions. On average, calcification declined by 41 \% in
   response to pH reduction, but increased by 49 \% in response to elevated
   temperature. Within each pH treatment, elevated temperature increased
   calcification by 23 \% (at pH 8.0) and 74 \% (at pH 7.6). Interactions
   between pH, temperature, and/or species were not observed. This work
   demonstrates that, in contrast to prior studies, increased temperature
   may serve to enhance the metabolic performance (photosynthesis and
   calcification) of some marine calcifiers, despite elevated carbon
   dioxide concentrations. Thus, in certain cases, ocean warming may
   mitigate the negative effects of acidification.},

Title = {Lateral, Vertical, and Temporal Variability of Seawater Carbonate
   Chemistry at Hog Reef, Bermuda},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {FEB 11},
Abstract = {Spatial and temporal carbonate chemistry variability on coral reefs is
   influenced by a combination of seawater hydrodynamics, geomorphology,
   and biogeochemical processes, though their relative influence varies by
   site. It is often assumed that the water column above most reefs is
   well-mixed with small to no gradients outside of the benthic boundary
   layer. However, few studies to date have explored the processes and
   properties controlling these multi-dimensional gradients. Here, we
   investigated the lateral, vertical, and temporal variability of seawater
   carbonate chemistry on a Bermudan rim reef using a combination of
   spatial seawater chemistry surveys and autonomous in situ sensors.
   Instruments were deployed at Hog Reef measuring current flow, seawater
   temperature, salinity, pH(T), pCO(2), dissolved oxygen (DO), and total
   alkalinity (TA) on the benthos, and temperature, salinity, DO, and
   pCO(2) at the surface. Water samples from spatial surveys were collected
   from surface and bottom depths at 13 stations covering similar to 3
   km(2) across 4 days. High frequency temporal variability in carbonate
   chemistry was driven by a combination of diel light and mixed
   semi-diurnal tidal cycles on the reef. Daytime gradients in DO between
   the surface and the benthos suggested significant water column
   production contributing to distinct diel trends in pH(T), pCO(2), and
   DO, but not TA. We hypothesize these differences reflect the
   differential effect of biogeochemical processes important in both the
   water column and benthos (organic carbon production/respiration) vs.
   processes mainly occurring on the benthos (calcium carbonate
   production/dissolution). Locally at Hog Reef, the relative magnitude of
   the diel variability of organic carbon production/respiration was
   1.4-4.6 times larger than that of calcium carbonate
   production/dissolution, though estimates of net organic carbon
   production and calcification based on inshore-offshore chemical
   gradients revealed net heterotrophy (-118 +/- 51 mmol m(-2) day(-1)) and
   net calcification (150 +/- 37 mmol CaCO3 m(-2) day(-1)). These results
   reflect the important roles of time and space in assessing reef
   biogeochemical processes. The spatial variability in carbonate chemistry
   parameters was larger laterally than vertically and was generally
   observed in conjunction with depth gradients, but varied between
   sampling events, depending on time of day and modifications due to

Abstract = {Aims Soil respiration is a major flux of CO2 to the atmosphere. Despite
   its significance there is a limited understanding of its magnitude,
   controlling factors and how it varies over time and space in arid
   ecosystems. We evaluated the temporal pattern of soil CO2 efflux and
   their response to rain pulses in a patagonian steppe, taking into
   account the spatial heterogeneity (bare soil and vegetated patches).
   Materials and methods We measured soil CO2 efflux in bare soil and
   vegetated patches along the year. We also analyzed physical and chemical
   soil traits, root density and heterotrophic bacterial count. Results
   Soil water content and temperature exhibited seasonal variability and it
   was larger in bare soil patches than in vegetated patches. Root density,
   organic matter and phosphorus were higher in vegetated patches than in
   bare soil. CO2 efflux was 48\% higher in vegetated patches than in bare
   soil patches. Soil CO2 efflux decreased from summer to winter, reaching
   its maximum value (about 0.6 mu mol m(2) s(-1)) in spring. In both patch
   types, soil CO2 efflux was explained by the interaction between soil
   temperature and soil water content. Soil CO2 efflux also was positively
   correlated with soil root density. Bare soil and vegetated patches
   exhibited distinct response to a rain pulses. Vegetated patches were
   highly sensitive to rainfall events, generating a large CO2 pulse,
   returning to previous values after three days. Bare soil CO2 efflux did
   not exhibit significant changes after a rain pulse. Conclusions In
   patagonian arid ecosystems, the seasonal variation in soil respiration
   is explained mainly by the interaction between soil temperature and
   water content. Bare soil patches had higher water content but lower root
   density resulting in lower soil CO2 respiration than vegetated patches.
   However, at ecosystem level the contribution of bare soil to total soil
   CO2 efflux was similar to the contribution of vegetated patches because
   bare soil cover is 65\% in the study area. Changes in the number of
   small rain events as well as changes in plant cover could have large
   consequences on soil ecology and biochemistry in dry and heterogeneous
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {We used a humid tropical elevation gradient to examine the relationships
   among climate, edaphic conditions, below-ground carbon storage, and soil
   respiration races. We also compared open and closed canopy sites to
   increase the range of microclimate conditions sampled along the

   storage, and C dynamics. Total soil C, the light C fraction, and all of
   the component fractions of the P pool were significantly related co soil
   moisture, and all but coral soil C were also significantly related to
   temperature. Both labile and recalcitrant soil P fractions were
   negatively correlated with the light C fraction, while the dilute
   HCl-extractable P pool, generally thought of as intermediate in
   availability, was positively correlated with light C, suggesting that P
   may play an important role in C cycling within these systems. Total fine
   root biomass was greatest at 1000 m elevation and lowest at 150 m, and
   was strongly and positively correlated with soil moisture content. Soil
   respiration rates were significantly and negatively correlated with fine
   root biomass and the light C fraction. In forested sites, soil
   respiration rates were strongly and negatively correlated with total
   belowground C pools (soils + roots + forest floor). Below-ground C pools
   did not follow the expected increasing trend with decreases in
   temperature along the gradient. Our results indicated that in humid
   tropical forests, the relationships among soil C and nutrient pools,
   soil respiration rates, and climate are complex. We suggest that
   frequent and prolonged anaerobic events could be important features of
   these environments that may explain the observed trends.},

Title = {A comparative analysis of the photobiology of Zooxanthellae and

Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {138},
Number = {3},
Pages = {477-489},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Throughout its geographic range, the temperate-zone anemone Anthopleura
   elegantissima is the host of one or both of two distinctively different
   symbiotic microalgae: a dinoflagellate Symbiodinium (zooxanthellae, ZX)
   and a chlorophyte (zoochlorellae, ZC). Given the broad vertical
   intertidal and latitudinal range of this anemone, we investigated the
   role of temperature in determining whether A. elegantissima supports one
   algal symbiont over the other and whether temperature regulates the
   observed distributions of natural populations of ZX and ZC. Temperature
   appears to be a key factor in regulating both the photophysiology and
   metabolism of this algal-cnidarian association. In anemones containing
   ZX, neither algal densities nor chlorophyll content varied with
   temperature (6-24.degreesC); in contrast, anemones with ZC displayed
   reduced densities and chlorophyll content at the highest temperature
   treatment (24 degreesC). Both. ZX and ZC photosynthetic rates were
   directly related to temperature, as were anemone respiration rates. The
   higher photosynthetic rates, maintenance of a stable algal density and
   chlorophyll content, and higher potential contribution of algal carbon
   toward animal respiration (CZAR) suggest that the ZX are the more viable
   symbiont as temperature increases, but we suggest alternative reasons
   why ZC are preserved in this symbiotic association. Elevated
   temperatures reduce ZC densities and chlorophyll, suggesting that higher
   temperatures affect this relationship in a negative fashion, presumably
   due to a higher cost of maintaining ZC by the association;
   alternatively, these costs may be affiliated with the deterioration of
   the ZC themselves. These results suggest that temperature may be one of
   the most significant environmental parameters that sets the intertidal
   microhabitat and latitudinal distribution patterns of the two algal taxa
   observed in the field.},

Title = {Combined effects of temperature and the herbicide diuron on Photosystem
   II activity of the tropical seagrass Halophila ovalis},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAR 30},
Abstract = {Tropical seagrasses are at their highest risk of exposure to photosystem
   II (PSII) herbicides when elevated rainfall and runoff from farms
   transports these toxicants into coastal habitats during summer,
   coinciding with periods of elevated temperature. PSII herbicides, such
   as diuron, can increase the sensitivity of corals to thermal stress, but
   little is known of the potential for herbicides to impact the thermal
   optima of tropical seagrass. Here we employed a well-plate approach to
   experimentally assess the effects of diuron on the photosynthetic
   performance of Halophila ovalis leaves across a 25 degrees C temperature
   range (36 combinations of these stressors across 15-40 degrees C). The
   thermal optimum for photosynthetic efficiency (Delta F/F `(m)) in H.
   ovalis was 31 degrees C while lower and higher temperatures reduced
   Delta F/F `(m) as did all elevated concentrations of diuron. There were
   significant interactions between the effects of temperature and diuron,
   with a majority of the combined stresses causing sub-additive
   (antagonistic) effects. However, both stressors caused negative
   responses and the sum of the responses was greater than that caused by
   temperature or diuron alone. These results indicate that improving water
   quality (reducing herbicide in runoff) is likely to maximise seagrass
   health during extreme temperature events that will become more common as
   the climate changes.},

   Induced by Thermal Stress in Collozoum pelagicum (Collodaria, Retaria)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Month = {OCT 29},
Abstract = {Collodaria (Retaria) are important contributors to planktonic
   communities and biogeochemical processes (e.g., the biologic pump) in
   oligotrophic oceans. Similarly to corals, Collodaria live in symbiosis
   with dinoflagellate algae, a relationship that is thought to explain
   partly their ecological success. In the context of global change, the
   robustness of the symbiotic interaction, and potential subsequent
   bleaching events are of primary interest for oceanic ecosystems
   functioning. In the present study, we compared the ultrastructure,
   morphology, symbiont density, photosynthetic capacities and respiration
   rates of colonial Collodaria exposed to a range of temperatures
   corresponding to natural conditions (21 degrees C), moderate (25 degrees
   C), and high (28 degrees C) thermal stress. We showed that symbiont
   density immediately decreased when temperature rose to 25 degrees C,
   while the overall Collodaria holobiont metabolic activity increased.
   When temperature reached 28 degrees C, the holobiont respiration nearly
   stopped and the host morphological structure was largely damaged, as if
   the host tolerance threshold has been crossed. Over the course of the
   experiment, the photosynthetic capacities of remaining algal symbionts
   were stable, chloroplasts being the last degraded organelles in the
   microalgae. These results contribute to a better characterization and
   understanding of temperature-induced bleaching processes in planktonic
   photosymbioses.},

   ecosystem dominated by calcareous macroalgae},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {334},
Pages = {37-45},
Abstract = {The community metabolism of a shallow infralittoral ecosystem dominated
   by the calcareous macroalgae Corallina elongata was investigated in
   Marseilles (NW Mediterranean), by monitoring hourly changes of seawater
   pH and total alkalinity over 6 d in February 2000. Fair weather
   conditions prevailed over the study period as indicated by oceanographic
   (temperature, salinity, and current velocity and direction) and
   meteorological variables, which validated the standing water hypothesis.
   This temperate ecosystem exhibited high community gross primary
   production (GPP = 519 +/- 106 mmol C m(-2) d(-1), n = 6) and also
   supported high rates of community respiration (R). As a result, the
   system was slightly autotrophic (net community production, NCP = 20 mmol
   C m(-2) d(-1)), with a GPP/R ratio of 1.06. NCP exhibited circadian
   variations with 2- to 3-fold changes in community respiration, both in
   the light and in the dark. Rates of net community calcification also
   exhibited circadian variations, with positive rates (up to 24 mmol CaCO3
   m(-2) h(-1)) for irradiance values > 300 W m(-2) (about 1380 mu mol
   photon m(-2) s(-1)). Below this irradiance threshold, net community
   dissolution prevailed. Daily net calcification (G) was on average 8 mmol
   CaCO3 m(-2) d(-1). CO2 fluxes generated by primary production,
   respiration, and calcification suggest that the study site was a
   potential atmospheric CO2 sink of 15 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) at the time of
   measurement.},

Abstract = {Increased atmospheric CO2 will have a twofold impact on future marine
   ecosystems, increasing global sea surface temperatures and uptake of CO2
   (Ocean Acidification). Many experiments focus on the investigation of
   one of these stressors, but under realistic future climate predictions,
   these stressors may have interactive effects on individuals. Here, we
   investigate the effect of warming and acidification in combination. We
   test for interactive effects of potential near-future (2100) temperature
   (+2 to 3 A degrees C) and pCO(2) (similar to 860-940 mu Atm) levels on
   the physiology of the tropical echinoid Echinometra sp. A. The greatest
   reduction in growth was under simultaneous temperature and pH/pCO(2)
   stress (marginally significant temperature x pH/pCO(2) interaction).
   This was mirrored by the physiological data, with highest metabolic
   activity (measured as respiration and ammonium excretion) occurring at
   the increased temperature and pCO(2) treatment, although this was not
   significant for excretion. The perivisceral coelomic fluid pH was
   similar to 7.5-7.6, as typical for echinoids, and showed no significant
   changes between treatments. Indicative of active calcification, internal
   magnesium and calcium concentrations were reduced compared to the
   external medium, but were not different between treatments. Gonad weight
   was lower at the higher temperature, and this difference was more
   distinct and statistically significant for males. The condition of the
   gonads assessed by histology declined in increased temperature and low
   pH treatments. The Echinometra grew in all treatments indicating active
   calcification of their magnesium calcite tests even as carbonate mineral
   saturation decreased. Our results indicate that the interactive
   temperature and pH effects are more important for adult echinoids than
   individual stressors. Although adult specimens grow and survive in
   near-future conditions, higher energy demands may influence gonad
   development and thus population maintenance.},

Abstract = {As marine ecosystems are predicted to be facing increases in both
   temperature and CO2 levels, resulting in increased acidity, scientific
   research is attempting to predict the effect that the altered
   environmental conditions will have on species, communities and,
   ultimately, ecosystems. This study focused on elevated temperature and
   ocean acidification effects on the ubiquitous, yet often overlooked,
   turf algal assemblages on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. In order to
   assess possible changes in relative abundance of species, biomass and
   productivity, 3 different levels of pH and 2 different levels of
   temperature treatments were applied to shallow water turf algal
   assemblages in a multifactorial (orthogonal) experiment. The eukaryotic
   component of the algal assemblages showed differential responses to
   combinations of pH and temperature treatments. The response was however
   dominated by a strong increase in the relative abundance of Lyngbya, a
   cyanobacterium, under acidification and higher temperature treatment
   levels, while other cyanobacteria, such as the Rivulariaceae, did not
   respond to the altered environment. Possible explanations for this
   observation may be differences in nitrogen fixation capacity and/or
   temperature optima. The biomass of the algal assemblages remained stable
   under all treatment levels, while changes in productivity associated
   with an interaction of the factors were observed. The findings of this
   experimental study highlight the complexity of turf algal assemblages in
   their composition and in their response to altered environmental
   conditions. However, they also support the dominant theoretical
   physiological predictions for eukaryotic and prokaryotic turf algae that
   suggest a positive or neutral response to future environmental

Abstract = {Environmental stress, such as an increase in the sea surface

   contributors to the bleaching phenomenon. To date, studies aiming to
   decipher the cellular cascade leading to temperature-related bleaching,

   compromised bioenergetic pathways (e.g. cellular respiration and
   photosynthesis). These molecules are responsible for damage to various
   cellular components causing the dysregulation of cellular homeostasis
   and the breakdown of symbiosis. In this review, we synthesize the

Abstract = {The sacoglossan Elysia timida (Risso, 1818) is typical of shallow sea
   areas and coastal lagoons. It retains symbiotic functional chloroplasts
   derived from its algal food Acetabularia acetabulum (Linnaeus) for 45
   days. However, some aspects of the photosynthetic behaviour of the
   mollusc-chloroplast association are unknown. This work studies the
   photosynthetic characteristics of E. timida from a lagoon environment
   (Mar Menor), defined between 25 and 600 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1) by the
   photosynthetic-irradiance curve. Experimental data were fitted to
   different exponential models and models based on Michaelis-Menten
   kinetics. Among the latter, the model that bests fits to the
   experimental data was identified. Furthermore, it incorporates
   respiration values and allows an estimation of compensation irradiance
   (I-c: 11.89 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)). This model showed a rapid
   saturation of the photosynthetic apparatus at relatively low irradiance
   values (I-k: 31.33 mu mol quanta m(-2)). Excess light seems to be
   modulated by the mollusc's opening and closing of their parapodia. Mean
   P/R values (Production versus Respiration relationship) are above 0.91;
   considered high in coral-zooxanthellae symbioses. The photosynthetic
   efficiency of the symbiotic chloroplasts is fairly high, taking into
   account that sacoglossans are more active than corals and have a higher

Abstract = {The effects of various environmental parameters on zooxanthellae
   isolated from the sea anemone Condylactis gigantea were studied under
   controlled conditions in the laboratory. We determined that the
   zooxanthellae, identified as Symbiodinium microadriaticum (by Trench.
   B.) belong to clade B. These algae were exposed to a range of
   temperatures (17, 21.7, 26 degrees C), light intensities (25, 30, 45, 85
   mu mol q m(-2) s(-1)) and nutrient regimes. While growth rate was
   relatively independent of treatment, respiration increased significantly
   with temperature. Both light and temperature did have a significant
   effect on photosynthetic parameters.
   The cultured zooxanthellae responded to the environment in ways similar
   to those of freshly isolated ones, and survived under a wide range of
   temperatures (17, 21.7, 26 degrees C).
   In general, clade B seems to be flexible and well adapted to the
   temperature range encountered in seawater throughout its wide global
   distribution. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Effects of thermal history on the responses to thermal stress of a large
   benthic foraminifera, Calcarina gaudichaudii},

Volume = {40},

Abstract = {Marine ecosystems, particularly coastal environments, are rapidly
   changing due to anthropogenic impacts resulting in increased global
   climate change (ocean warming), ocean acidification, hypoxia, and
   eutrophication. On coral reefs, symbiont-bearing large benthic
   foraminifera (LBFs) can play a key role as reef constituents and
   carbonate producers, contributing up to 5\% of reef-scale carbonate
   budgets. However, projected climate change, particularly ocean warming,
   has the potential to significantly alter the conditions in which marine
   organisms persist. While the response of LBFs to elevated thermal stress
   is well documented in laboratory studies, the potential influence of
   adaptation or acclimatization through prior environmental thermal
   history on this response remains largely unknown. In this study,
   specimens of Calcarina gaudichaudii, an LBF from the Penghu Islands,
   Taiwan, were collected from thermally variable intertidal and thermally
   stable subtidal (similar to 6 m depth) environments representing thermal
   history. LBFs were then acclimated to laboratory conditions at ambient
   (25 degrees C) and elevated (28 degrees C) temperatures for three weeks,
   and subsequently exposed to control and heat stress treatments (25
   degrees C, 28 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 33 degrees C) for an additional
   one week. Photosynthetic rates (determined through oxygen flux
   measurements) of C. gaudichaudii significantly decreased in specimens
   collected at subtidal depths acclimated at 25 degrees C when compared to
   those acclimated at 28 degrees C, whereas there was no effect of thermal
   history on respiration, indicating that symbiont and holobiont responses
   may differ in LBFs. Additionally, maximum photochemical efficiency
   (Fv/Fm) significantly decreased as a result of heat stress, although
   bleaching was not visually observed after one week. These results
   highlight the plastic responses of the algal microbiome and indicate
   that thermal history, acclimatization temperature, and heat stress
   interact to affect the physiological status of C. gaudichaudii. This
   study adds to the growing literature which highlights the larger
   implications of understanding thermal history as an important factor to
   consider to better understand how ecosystem processes (e.g., carbonate
   production) are altered on modern coral reefs.},

Abstract = {This study was aimed to assess the role that leaf litter play in
   nutrient cycling, nutrient soil availability and ecosystem processes in
   an oligotrophic tropical savanna.
   A four year experiment was performed in a Neotropical savanna from the
   Brazilian plateau (cerrado), in which litter levels were modified, and
   the resulting changes in biophysical and chemical soil properties were
   studied. Changes in organic matter decomposition, soil respiration and
   stem growth of the six most common tree species were also monitored.
   Compared to litter removal plots, double litter plots had lower maximum
   soil temperature and higher soil water content, and litter decomposition
   rates in one of three species studied, consistent with higher soil
   respiration rates observed in this treatment. With the exception of Ca,
   there were no significant differences in nutrients between the removal,
   natural and double litter plots, even though most nutrients tended to
   increase in the double litter plots by the end of the experimental
   period, while in the control plots nutrient levels remained relatively
   constant. Of the six tree species used for growth analysis, only one,
   Sclerolobium paniculatum, a fast growing species with shallow roots, had
   a significant increase in stem growth due to litter addition.
   Preliminary results over four years indicate that litter removal and
   addition resulted in some significant changes and tendencies that
   indicate that litter is effectively altering ecosystem processes. The
   information obtained also suggest that nutrient cycling in plots with
   natural litter levels (control plots) was in a closed loop; most
   nutrients released by litter decomposition and mineralization were
   absorbed and reutilized immediately by the plants, thus minimizing
   nutrient leakage outside the system.},

Abstract = {The effects of anthropogenic pressures in coastal areas are extensively
   studied in temperate but not in tropical zones, where their impact might
   be amplified by high water temperatures and upwelling phenomena.
   Sedimentary features and benthic metabolism were studied during the non
   upwelling (NUPW) and upwelling (UPW) seasons in Taganga Bay (Colombia).
   The bay is impacted by a submarine outfall of virtually untreated,
   organic and nutrient-rich wastewater. Samplings were performed in
   November 2017 (NUPW) and in January-February 2018 (UPW) at 4 stations
   located in the proximity and 100, 750 and 1800 m far from the outfall,
   respectively, at depths between 22 and 28 m. Aerobic respiration,
   denitrification, dissimilative nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) and
   nutrient fluxes were measured. The influence of the outfall was
   detectable 750 and 1800 m away from the point pollution source, where
   delta C-13 data suggested that similar to 40 and similar to 20\% of
   organic inputs were terrigenous, respectively. In the proximity of the
   outfall benthic oxygen demand peaked and the presence ofBeggiatoamats
   suggested reoxidation of sulphides, that were abundant in pore water.
   Under sulfidic conditions, DNRA was the major driver of nitrate demand,
   whereas at stations far from the outfall, denitrification dominated
   nitrate consumption. Organic matter and nitrate inputs to the bay during
   the UPW season enhanced the effects of the outfall by increasing aerobic
   respiration and DNRA. Higher N availability during the UPW season
   reversed fluxes of molecular nitrogen and turned the sediments of 3 out
   of 4 sites from net sinks to net N(2)sources. Results from this study
   suggest that the analysis of sediments allows tracing the impact of the
   outfall and that such impact is enhanced during the upwelling season. In
   tropical areas, marine outfalls and upwelling may act in synergy and
   contribute to ecosystem deterioration due to high temperatures, increase
   of microbial respiration, sulphide toxicity and benthic biodiversity
   loss.},

Abstract = {Size variation among propagules is ubiquitous and small initial
   differences in size can be critical to survival, particularly in taxa
   where initial survival is variable and strongly size-dependent. Despite
   this, the sources of size variation among fish at hatching are, rarely
   investigated. This study examined spatial position within egg clutches
   as a source of size variation at hatching of the benthic spawning fish
   Amphiprion melanopus. We quantified within-clutch size variation at
   hatching and found that newly hatched larvae from the periphery (5 mm
   from edge) of 2-dimensional clutches were smaller in standard length,
   cranial depth, eye diameter and body area (7\%, 8\%, 4\% and 11\%,
   respectively) than larvae from the interior positions within clutches.
   To investigate the source of this variation, sizes of embryos at
   different locations with clutches were measured within 2 h of
   fertilisation (8 d before hatching). Newly laid embryos from the clutch
   periphery were smaller in length and volume than embryos from the clutch
   interior (> 2\% and 4-6\%, respectively). These eggs from the periphery
   also had a 33\% lower rate of oxygen consumption than did embryos from
   the clutch interior, throughout development. The relationships between
   position within a clutch and egg size, oxygen consumption and larval
   size imply that size variation in larval fish at hatching is partly
   generated during early embryogenesis, either from maternal endowment or
   maternal nest design, and was amplified throughout development. (c) 2005

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are facing rapidly changing environments, but implications
   for reef ecosystem functioning and important services, such as
   productivity, are difficult to predict. Comparative investigations on
   coral reefs that are naturally exposed to differing environmental
   settings can provide essential information in this context. One
   prevalent phenomenon regularly introducing alterations in water
   chemistry into coral reefs are internal waves. This study therefore
   investigates the effect of large amplitude internal waves (LAIW) on
   primary productivity in coral reefs at the Similan Islands (Andaman Sea,
   Thailand). The LAIW-exposed west sides of the islands are subjected to
   sudden drops in water temperature accompanied by enhanced inorganic
   nutrient concentrations compared to the sheltered east. At the central
   island, Ko Miang, east and west reefs are only few hundred meters apart,
   but feature pronounced differences. On the west lower live coral cover
   (-38 \%) coincides with higher turf algae cover (+64 \%) and growth (+54
   \%) compared to the east side. Turf algae and the reef sand-associated
   microphytobenthos displayed similar chlorophyll a contents on both
   island sides, but under LAIW exposure, turf algae exhibited higher net
   photosynthesis (+23 \%), whereas the microphytobenthos displayed reduced
   net and gross photosynthesis (-19 \% and -26 \%, respectively)
   accompanied by lower respiration (-42 \%). In contrast, the predominant
   coral Porites lutea showed higher chlorophyll a tissues contents (+42
   \%) on the LAIW-exposed west in response to lower light availability and
   higher inorganic nutrient concentrations, but net photosynthesis was
   comparable for both sides. Turf algae were the major primary producers
   on the west side, whereas microphytobenthos dominated on the east. The
   overall primary production rate (comprising all main benthic primary
   producers) was similar on both island sides, which indicates high
   primary production variability under different environmental conditions.},

Abstract = {Although wetlands are among the world's most productive ecosystems,
   little is known of long-term CO2 exchange in tropical and subtropical
   wetlands. The Everglades is a highly managed wetlands complex occupying
   >6000 km(2) in south Florida. This ecosystem is oligotrophic, but
   extremely high rates of productivity have been previously reported. To
   evaluate CO2 exchange and its response to seasonality (dry vs. wet
   season) in the Everglades, an eddy covariance tower was established in a
   short-hydroperiod marl marsh. Rates of net ecosystem exchange and
   ecosystem respiration were small year-round and declined in the wet
   season relative to the dry season. Inundation reduced macrophyte CO2
   uptake, substantially limiting gross ecosystem production. While light
   and air temperature exerted the primary controls on net ecosystem
   exchange and ecosystem respiration in the dry season, inundation
   weakened these relationships. The ecosystem shifted from a CO2 sink in
   the dry season to a CO2 source in the wet season; however, the marsh was
   a small carbon sink on an annual basis. Net ecosystem production,
   ecosystem respiration, and gross ecosystem production were -49.9, 446.1
   and 496.0 g C m(-2) year(-1), respectively. Unexpectedly low CO2 flux
   rates and annual production distinguish the Everglades from many other
   wetlands. Nonetheless, impending changes in water management are likely
   to alter the CO2 balance of this wetland and may increase the source
   strength of these extensive short-hydroperiod wetlands. (C) 2010

Abstract = {The photosynthetic performance, pigmentation, and growth of a Halimeda

   Keys, USA during summer-fall periods of 5 consecutive years. The
   physiology and growth of H. tuna (Ellis \& Solander) Lamouroux and H.
   opuntia (L.) Lamouroux on this algal dominated reef were highly
   variable. Maximum rate of net photosynthesis (P-max ), respiration rate,
   and quantum efficiency (alpha) did not differ between populations of
   either species at 7 versus 21 m, even though the 21-m site received a
   66\% lower photon flux density (PFD). Physiological parameters, as well
   as levels of photosynthetic pigments, varied temporally. P-max ,
   saturation irradiance, compensation irradiance, and growth were greatest
   in summer months, whereas alpha, chl a , chl b , and carotenoid
   concentrations were elevated each fall. Halimeda tuna growth rates were
   higher at 7 m compared with 21 m for only two of five growth trials.
   This may have arisen from variability in light and nutrient
   availability. Individuals growing at 7 m received a 29\% greater PFD in
   August 2001 than in 1999. In August 1999 and 2001 seawater temperatures
   were uniform over the 14-m gradient, whereas in August 2000 cold water
   regularly intruded upon the 21-m but not the 7-m site. These results
   illustrate the potentially dynamic relationship between nutrients,

   long-term monitoring over spatial and temporal gradients to accurately
   characterize factors that impact productivity.},

Abstract = {Juvenile colonies of massive Porites spp. were exposed to manipulated pH
   and bicarbonate ({[}HCO3]) in situ to test the hypothesis that ocean
   acidification ( OA) does not affect respiration and calcification.
   Incubations lasted 28 h and exposed corals to ambient temperature and
   light with ecologically relevant water motion. Three treatments were
   applied: (1) ambient conditions of pH 8.04 and 1751 mol
   HCO(3)(-)kg(-1)(Treatment 1), (2) pCO(2)(-) induced ocean acidification
   of pH 7.73 and 2011 mol HCO3 kg(-1)Treatment 2), and (3) pCO(2) and
   HCO3- enriched seawater of pH 7.69 and 2730 mol
   HCO(3)(-)kg(-1)(Treatment 3). The third treatment providing elevated
   {[}HCO3- was used to test for stimulatory effects of dissolved inorganic
   carbon on calcification under low pH and low saturation of aragonite
   (arag), but it does not reflect conditions expected to occur under CO2-
   driven OA. Calcification of juvenile massive Porites spp. was affected
   by treatments, with an 81\% elevation in Treatment 3 versus Treatment 1,
   but no difference between Treatments 1 and 2; respiration and the
   metabolic expenditure concurrent with calcification remained unaffected.
   These findings indicate that juvenile massive Porites spp. are resistant
   to short exposures to OA in situ, and separately, that they can increase
   calcification at low pH and low arag if {[}HCO3- is elevated. Juvenile
   Porites spp. may therefore be limited by dissolved inorganic carbon

Abstract = {The direct influence of anthropogenic CO2 might play a limited role in
   pH regulation in coastal ecosystems as pH regulation in these areas can
   be complex. They experience large variability across a broad range of
   spatial and temporal scales, with complex external and internal drivers.
   Organisms influence pH at a patch scale, where community metabolic
   effects and hydrodynamic processes interact to produce broad ranges in
   pH, (similar to 0.3-0.5 pH units) over daily cycles and spatial scales
   (mm to m) particularly in shallow vegetated habitats and coral reefs
   where both respiration and photosynthetic activity are intense.
   Biological interactions at the ecosystem scale, linked to patchiness in
   habitat landscapes and seasonal changes in metabolic processes and
   temperature lead to changes of about 0.3-0.5 pH units throughout a year.
   Furthermore, on the scale of individual organisms, small-scale processes
   including changes at the Diffusive Boundary Layer (DBL), interactions
   with symbionts, and changes to the specific calcification environment,
   induce additional changes in excess of 0.5 pH units.
   In these highly variable pH environments calcifying organisms have
   developed the capacity to alter the pH of their calcifying environment,
   or specifically within critical tissues where calcification occurs, thus
   achieving a homeostasis. This capacity to control the conditions for
   calcification at the organism scale may therefore buffer the full

Abstract = {Eggs from laboratory spawnings of the coral-reef fish Siganus randalli
   Woodland were incubated at two temperatures (27 and 30-degrees-C). Eggs
   and larvae were sampled until larval starvation, while changes in oxygen
   consumption, growth, yolk utilization, and development were monitored.
   Oxygen consumption, which peaked at hatching, was higher for embryos
   incubated at 30-degrees-C than at 27-degrees-C. Rates of oxygen
   consumption (nl h-1 individual-1) at hatching were similar to those for
   other temperate and tropical species. Rates of oxygen consumption by
   yolk-sac larvae were highly variable, and these data suggest that larval
   oxygen consumption prior to yolk-sac absorption may not be significantly
   influenced by temperature. Rates of yolk depletion were higher for
   larvae at the higher temperature. After an initial rapid increase in
   length, length of larvae at 30-degrees-C decreased with age. Egg size,
   egg weight, and maximum notochord length of larvae differed
   significantly between spawns. Age-specific oxygen consumption rates by
   the embryos varied between spawns, but regressions describing oxygen
   consumption as a function of age did not differ significantly. The
   initiation and completion of eye pigmentation were used as developmental
   markers to calculate the amount of yolk remaining for larvae at the
   different temperatures. Larvae maintained at 30-degrees-C completed eye
   pigmentation approximately 3 h sooner than those maintained at
   27-degrees-C, but had less endogenous reserves. This finding indicates a
   trade-off between rapid development and efficient utilization of the
   endogenous reserves. The completion of eye pigmentation in larvae
   incubated at the higher temperature occurred at midnight and, depending
   on the amount of time that the larvae have to initiate feeding prior to
   the `'point-of-no-return'', the timing of completion of eye pigmentation
   could influence larval survival.},

Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {2601-2615},
Abstract = {Benthic metabolism and inorganic nitrogen and N-2 flux rates
   (denitrification) were measured in permeable carbonate sands from Heron
   Island (Great Barrier Reef). Some of the N-2 flux rates were among the
   highest measured in sediments. All benthic fluxes showed a significant
   difference between seasons with higher rates in summer and late summer.
   There was no distinct response of the benthic system to mass coral
   spawning. Instead, changes in benthic fluxes over 12 days in summer
   appear to be driven by tidal changes in water depth and associated
   changes in phytosynthetically active radiation reaching the sediments.
   Dark N-2 fluxes were strongly correlated to benthic oxygen consumption
   across all sites and seasons (r(2) = 0.63; p < 0.005; slope = 0.035).
   However, there were seasonal differences with a steeper slope in summer
   than winter, reflecting either more efficient coupling between
   respiration and nitrification-denitrification at higher temperatures or
   different sources of organic matter. Adding data from published studies
   on carbonate sands revealed two slopes in the dark N-2 flux versus
   benthic oxygen consumption relationship. The lower slope (0.035) was
   most likely due to high carbon : nitrogen (C : N) organic matter from
   coral reefs, and associated assimilation of nitrogen by heterotrophic
   bacteria including enhanced heterotrophic N-fixation, but competition by
   benthic microalgae or inefficient coupling between respiration and
   nitrification-denitrification cannot be excluded. The steeper slope
   (0.089) was most likely due to respiration being driven by low C : N
   phytodetritus. If the different slopes were driven by the sources of
   organic matter, then global estimates of continental shelf
   denitrification are probably about right. In contrast, global estimates
   of continental shelf denitrification may be over-estimated if the low
   slope was due to inefficient coupling between respiration and
   nitrification-denitrification and also due to reduced N-2 effluxes in
   the light associated with competition by benthic microalgae for nitrogen
   and N-fixation.},

Abstract = {Perturbed colonies of Phenganax parrini and Sarcothelia sp. exhibit
   migration of symbionts of Symbiodinium spp. into the stolons.
   Densitometry and visual inspection indicated that polyps bleached while
   stolons did not. When migration was triggered by temperature, light and
   confinement, colonies of Sarcothelia sp. decreased rates of oxygen
   formation in the light (due to the effects of perturbation on
   photosynthesis and respiration) and increased rates of oxygen uptake in
   the dark (due to the effects of perturbation on respiration alone).
   Colonies of P. parrini, by contrast, showed no significant changes in
   either aspect of oxygen metabolism. When migration was triggered by
   light and confinement, colonies of Sarcothelia sp. showed decreased
   rates of oxygen formation in the light and increased rates of oxygen
   uptake in the dark, while colonies of P. parrini maintained the former
   and increased the latter. During symbiont migration into their stolons,
   colonies of both species showed dramatic increases in reactive oxygen
   species (ROS), as visualized with a fluorescent probe, with stolons of
   Sarcothelia sp. exhibiting a nearly immediate increase of ROS.
   Differences in symbiont type may explain the greater sensitivity of
   colonies of Sarcothelia sp. Using fluorescent probes, direct
   measurements of migrating symbionts in the stolons of Sarcothelia sp.
   showed higher levels of reactive nitrogen species and lower levels of
   ROS than the surrounding host tissue. As measured by native
   fluorescence, levels of NAD(P) H in the stolons were unaffected by
   perturbation. Symbiont migration thus correlates with dramatic
   physiological changes and may serve as a marker for coral condition.},

Abstract = {Concurrent anthropogenic global climate change and ocean acidification
   are expected to have a negative impact on calcifying marine organisms.
   While knowledge of biological responses of organisms to oceanic stress
   has emerged from single-species experiments, these do not capture
   ecologically relevant scenarios where the potential for multi-organism
   physiological interactions is assessed. Marine algae provide an
   interesting case study, as their photosynthetic activity elevates pH in
   the surrounding microenvironment, potentially buffering more acidic
   conditions for associated epiphytes. We present findings that indicate
   increased tolerance of an important epiphytic for aminifera, Marginopora
   vertebralis, to the effects of increased temperature (+/- 3 degrees C)
   and p CO2(similar to 1,000 mu atm) when associated with its common algal
   host, Laurencia intricata. Specimens of M. vertebralis were incubated
   for 15 days in flow-through aquaria simulating current and
   end-of-century temperature and pH conditions. Physiological measures of
   growth (change in wet weight), calcification (measured change in total
   alkalinity in closed bottles), photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), total
   chlorophyll, photosynthesis (oxygen flux), and respiration were
   determined. When incubated in isolation,M. vertebralis-exhibited reduced
   growth in end-of-century projections of ocean acidification conditions,
   while calcification rates were lowest in the high-temperature, low-pH
   treatment. Interestingly, association with L. intricata ameliorated
   these stress effects with the growth and calcification rates ofM.
   vertebralis being similar to those observed in ambient conditions. Total
   chlorophyll levels in M. vertebral is decreased when in association with
   L. intricata, while maximum photochemical efficiency increased in
   ambient conditions. Net production estimates remained similar between M.
   vertebralis in isolation and in association with L. intricata, although
   both production and respiration rates ofM. vertebralis were
   significantly higher when associated with L. intricata. These results
   indicate that the association with L. intricata increases the resilience
   ofM. vertebralis to climate change stress, providing one of the first
   examples of physiological buffering by a marine alga that can ameliorate
   the negative effects of changing ocean conditions.},

Title = {Improper Diving Behavior Affects Physiological Responses of Acropora
   hyacinthus and Porites cylindrica},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 8},
Abstract = {Human activities beyond ecosystem capacity have resulted in serious
   effects on corals worldwide. Nowadays, many studies have focused on the
   influence of diving activities on coral communities, while the knowledge
   of physiological changes under corresponding environmental stresses
   remains largely undetermined. In the study, we aimed to investigate the
   physiological effects of touching, ammonia nitrogen enrichment (5 mu
   mol.L-1), and sediment cover (particle size of less than 0.3 mm), which
   simulated improper self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA)
   diving behaviors, on Acropora hyacinthus and Porites cylindrica in
   Wuzhizhou Island, the South China Sea. For A. hyacinthus, continuous
   touching caused the tentacles to shrink and secrete mucus, which
   consumed energy and dissolved oxygen. The skeletal growth rate was
   decreased by 72\% compared with the control group. There was a rapid
   decline of Fv/Fm and alpha under the dual impacts of high ammonia
   nitrogen and touching, while the Chl a concentration and tissue biomass
   were decreased by 36 and 28\% compared with touching alone,
   respectively. High ammonia nitrogen and touching increased the
   concentrations of lipid and protein. Nevertheless, zooxanthellae density
   was increased by 23\% to relieve the effects of a lower concentration of
   Chl a in a high nutrient environment. Constant touching and sediment
   cover in diving areas with elevated ammonia content affected the
   photosynthesis and respiration of corals, and a significant decrease was
   observed for lipid, zooxanthellae density, and Chl a concentration.
   Coral bleaching occurred on day 7. For P. cylindrica, the decreasing
   magnitude of Fv/Fm and alpha under different stresses in the subsequent
   phase was less compared with A. hyacinthus. The contents of carbohydrate
   and protein under continuous touching were decreased by 7 and 15\%
   compared with the control group, respectively, causing negative growth.
   Under the dual influences of high ammonia nitrogen and continuous
   touching, all energy reserves were significantly lower. Repeated
   touching and sediment cover in diving areas containing high ammonia
   content increased the concentrations of lipid and protein compared with
   the touching and high nutrient treatment group likely because that
   Porites associated with C15 zooxanthella increased heterotrophic feeding
   to compensate for restricted symbiodiniaceae photosynthesis.
   Additionally, P. cylindrica produced mucus to aid the removal of
   sediment, so that corals didn't obviously bleach during the experiment.
   Collectively, P. cylindrica was more resistant to diving activities than
   A. hyacinthus which only relies on photoautotrophy. To ensure the
   sustainable development of coral reef dive tourism, it is necessary to
   strengthen the supervision of diving behaviors, rotate the diving areas,
   and conduct regular assessments on the coral status.},

Abstract = {Competition for space directly affects the structure of the sessile
   benthic communities on hard substrates. On the Brazilian coast Palythoa
   caribaeorum is an abundant shallow water mat-forming zoantharian and has
   fast growth rates. The objective of the present study was to assess the
   zoantharian's biotic resistance by investigating changes in growth rates
   when interacting with the invasive sun corals Tubastraea tagusensis and
   T. coccinea on a tropical rocky shore in southeast Brazil. In the
   experimental design, eight blocks were arranged along the rocky shore
   where the growth treatment was applied with four different levels:
   empty, skeleton, live T. coccinea and live T. tagusensis. We opened up
   10 x 10 cm(2) spaces in the P. caribaeorum mat into which treatments
   were transplanted with epoxy putty. Growth measures of the zoantharian
   were obtained using photographs. During the 184 days of the experiment,
   P. caribaeorum had the highest total growth rate in the empty treatment
   with an average value of 2.124 +/- 0.189 mm.mo(-1); the treatment with
   the lowest total growth rate was T. coccinea with mean value of 1.104
   +/- 0.117 mm.mo(-1). The presence of T. coccinea influenced the growth
   rate of the zoantharian, unlike its congeneric T. tagusensis, which did
   not significantly influence the growth rate of P. caribaeorum. The
   negative interactions between P. caribaeorum and the invasive Tubastraea
   spp. were species specific in nature, and the native zoantharian
   exhibited quite some biotic resistance to the invasive species,
   especially to T. tagusensis. This was due to competition, probably
   mediated both through physical and/or chemical mechanisms and preemptive
   occupation of space. Growth rates of P. caribaeorum were dependent on
   the degree of competitive interaction as well as seasonal differences in
   light and/or temperature which remain to be elucidated. From a
   management perspective, the manual removal of Tubastraea spp. will allow
   native species such as P. caribaeorum to recover space and thus foster
   ecosystem recovery.},

Abstract = {Few studies have investigated the effects of ocean warming and
   acidification on marine benthic organisms over ecologically relevant
   time scales. We used an environmentally controlled coral reef mesocosm
   system to assess growth and physiological responses of the sea urchin
   species Echinometra sp. A over 2 generations. Each mesocosm was
   controlled for temperature and pCO(2) over 29 mo under 3 climate change
   scenarios (present day and predicted states in 2050 and 2100 under RCP
   8.5). The system maintained treatment conditions including annual
   temperature cycles and a daily variation in pCO(2). Over 20 mo, adult
   Echinometra exhibited no significant difference in size and weight among
   the treatments. Growth rates and respiration rates did not differ
   significantly among treatments. Urchins from the 2100 treatment had
   elevated ammonium excretion rates and reduced O-2:N ratios, suggesting a
   change in catabolism. We detected no difference in spawning index scores
   or oocyte size after 20 mo in the treatments, suggesting that gonad
   development was not impaired by variations in pCO(2) and temperature
   reflecting anticipated climate change scenarios. Larvae produced from
   experimentally exposed adults were successfully settled from all
   treatments and raised for 5 mo inside the mesocosm. The final size of
   these juveniles exhibited no significant difference among treatments.
   Overall, we demonstrated that the mesocosm system provided a near
   natural environment for this urchin species. Climate change and ocean
   acidification did not affect the benthic life stages investigated here.
   Importantly, in previous short-term (weeks to months) experiments, this
   species exhibited reductions in growth and gonad development,
   highlighting the potential for short-term experiments with
   non-acclimated animals to yield contrasting, possibly erroneous results.},

Abstract = {The bioeroding sponge Cliona orientalis is photosymbiotic with
   dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium and is pervasive on the Great
   Barrier Reef. We investigated how C. orientalis responded to past and
   future ocean conditions in a simulated community setting. The experiment
   lasted over an Austral summer under four carbon dioxide emission
   scenarios: a pre-industrial scenario (PI), a present-day scenario (PD;
   control), and two future scenarios of combined ocean acidification and
   ocean warming, i.e., B1 (intermediate) and A1FI (extreme). The four
   scenarios also simulated natural variability of carbon dioxide partial
   pressure and temperature in seawater. Responses of C. orientalis
   generally remained similar between the PI and PD treatments. C.
   orientalis under B1 displayed a dramatic increase in lateral tissue
   extension, but bleached and displayed reduced rates of respiration and
   photosynthesis. Some B1 sponge replicates died by the end of the
   experiment. Under A1FI, strong bleaching and subsequent mortality of all
   C. orientalis replicates occurred at an early stage of the experiment.
   Mortality arrested bioerosion by C. orientalis under B1 and A1FI.
   Overall, the absolute amount of calcium carbonate eroded by C.
   orientalis under B1 or A1FI was similar to that under PI or PD at the
   end of the experiment. Although bioerosion rates were raised by
   short-term experimental acidification in previous studies, our findings
   from the photosymbiotic C. orientalis imply that the effects of
   bioerosion on reef carbonate budgets may only be temporary if the
   bioeroders cannot survive long-term in the future oceans.},

Abstract = {This study compares the critical oxygen saturation (O-2crit) levels of
   the shiner perch Cymatogaster aggregata obtained using two different
   methods wherein hypoxia is induced either by the fish's respiration
   (closed respirometry) or by degassing oxygen with nitrogen

   a higher O-2 saturation in the closed respirometry method when compared
   with the intermittent-flow method. Utilization of closed respirometry
   yielded O-2crit measurements that were almost twice as high as those
   obtained with intermittent-flow respirometry. The lower hypoxia
   tolerance in closed respirometry is consistent with additional stress,
   caused by a build-up of ammonia and carbon dioxide and a faster rate in
   dissolved oxygen decline. The results indicate that these two methods of

Abstract = {The 3-day diurnal dynamics of carbonate system and related parameters on
   Luhuitou fringing reef of Sanya Bay-adjacent to the South China Sea
   (SCS) were observed in December of 2009 (early winter), April (spring),
   July (summer) and November (late-autumn) of 2010. The Luhuitou fringing
   reef ecosystem was generally dominated by macro and planktonic algae
   throughout the year except by coralline algae in winter. The system
   parameters showed distinct diurnal trends in the four seasons. Averaged
   ranges of diurnal variation for dissolved oxygen and partial pressure of
   CO2 (pCO(2)) were higher in the autumn, 4.67 mg L-1 and 218.2 mu atm,
   respectively than other seasons. Averaged ranges of diurnal variation
   for normalized total alkalinity (NTA) was higher in the winter (61.3 mu
   mol kg(-1)), and lower in the spring (16.0 mu nol kg(-1)). The diurnal
   variations are mainly controlled by biological activities, especially by
   the processes of photosynthesis and respiration in the reef ecosystem.
   In winter, however, calcification and dissolution contributed more to
   the diurnal variations, compared with the other three seasons. Total
   alkalinity was largely related to seasonal changes in river inflow
   rates. Dissolved oxygen, pH, total CO2 and aragonite saturation also
   showed seasonal variations. These variations were mainly controlled by
   the seasonal changes of photosynthesis and respiration, which were
   mainly affected by changes in benthic community structure, temperature
   and river inflow rates. The oversaturated pCO(2) in the reef ecosystem
   with respect to the atmosphere in the winter and summer resulted in CO2
   discharge from the reef ecosystem to the SCS. The whole system served as
   net source of CO2 to the atmosphere and the adjacent South China Sea on
   an annual time scale. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Many modern continental shelves are areas of calcareous faunal and
   floral growth and subsequent carbonate accumulation. These depositional
   environments can be subdivided into three major zones: (1)
   tropical/warm-water; (2) temperate/cool-water and (3) polar/cold-water,
   Our research focused on the temperate environment. We analysed 51
   samples of corals, coralline algae and bryozoans and 9 calcitic cements
   from bottom sediment samples from the Lacepede Shelf, South Australia
   for their mineralogy, oxygen and carbon isotopes, and distribution of
   major, minor and trace elements.
   Azooxanthellate corals are depleted in delta(18)O and delta(13)C in
   comparison to equilibrium values but less so than their tropical
   counterparts. Coralline algae are enriched in delta(18)O and delta(13)C
   compared to tropical samples. Both azooxanthellate corals and coralline
   algae display a positive correlation between their isotopes. The bottom
   temperature versus delta(18)O curve for the aragonitic bryozoan Adeona
   sp. parallels the equilibrium aragonite curve. These delta(18)O values
   are in equilibrium with the ambient water but differ from those for
   Adeona sp, from the Indian (tropical) Ocean. Its delta(13)C content is
   almost in equilibrium and higher than its tropical counterpart, despite
   lower delta(13)C values for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIG) in the
   study area.
   This study shows that carbon isotope disequilibrium of carbonate-rich
   biota is greater than that of oxygen isotopes. Furthermore, the isotopic
   ratios for similar organisms are different from one environment to
   another. Even more importantly, diverse organisms living in the same
   environment may have dissimilar isotope values. This can be attributed
   to either metabolic processes or kinetic effects. For the former,
   photosynthesis is the major cause of delta(13)C enrichment in
   photosynthetic organisms, and respiration induces some depletion.
   Extrinsic factors (e.g., depth, salinity, temperature, turbidity,
   substrate, and oxygen levels, etc.) variably mediate differences.
   Organisms with aragonitic mineralogy, such as corals and some bryozoans,
   have higher Sr and lower Mg, Fe and Mn concentrations than calcitic ones
   (e.g., coralline algae). These differences may be functions of various
   combinations of the following processes: (a) mineralogical
   discrimination against some trace elements, (b) skeletal formation
   process, (c) environmental variables and (d) physiology of the organism.
   Differences between temperate and tropical biotic geochemistry may be
   useful for differentiating between temperate and tropical environments
   in the rock record, providing diagenesis has not altered the primary
   signatures.},

Title = {A physicochemical framework for interpreting the biological

Abstract = {A generalized physicochemical model of the response of marine organisms'
   calcifying fluids to CO2-induced ocean acidification is proposed. The
   model is based upon the hypothesis that some marine calcifiers induce
   calcification by elevating pH, and thus Omega(A), of their calcifying
   fluid by removing protons (H+). The model is explored through two
   end-member scenarios: one in which a fixed number of H+ is removed from
   the calcifying fluid, regardless of atmospheric pCO(2), and another in
   which a fixed external-internal H+ ratio ({[}H+](E)/{[}H+](I)) is
   maintained. The model is able to generate the full range of
   calcification response patterns observed in prior ocean acidification
   experiments and is consistent with the assertion that organisms'
   calcification response to ocean acidification is more negative for
   marine calcifiers that exert weaker control over their calcifying fluid
   pH. The model is empirically evaluated for the temperate scleractinian
   coral Astrangia poculata with in situ pH microelectrode measurements of
   the coral's calcifying fluid under control and acidified conditions.
   These measurements reveal that (1) the pH of the coral's calcifying
   fluid is substantially elevated relative to its external seawater under
   both control and acidified conditions, (2) the coral's
   {[}H+](E)/{[}H+](I) is approximately the same under control and
   acidified conditions, and (3) the coral removes fewer H+ from its
   calcifying fluid under acidified conditions than under control
   conditions. Thus, the carbonate system dynamics of A. poculata's
   calcifying fluid appear to be most consistent with the fixed
   {[}H+](E)/{[}H+](I) end-member scenario. Similar microelectrode
   experiments performed on additional taxa are required to assess the
   model's general applicability. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Pre-exposure to simultaneous, but not individual, climate change
   stressors limits acclimation capacity of Irukandji jellyfish polyps to
   predicted climate scenarios},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {36},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Researchers have investigated the immediate effects of end-of-century
   climate change scenarios on many marine species, yet it remains unclear
   whether we can reliably predict how marine species may respond to future
   conditions because biota may become either more or less resistant over
   time. Here, we examined the role of pre-exposure to elevated temperature
   and reduced pH in mitigating the potential negative effects of future
   ocean conditions on polyps of a dangerous Irukandji jellyfish Alatina
   alata. We pre-exposed polyps to elevated temperature (28 degrees C) and
   reduced pH (7.6), in a full factorial experiment that ran for 14 d. We
   secondarily exposed original polyps and their daughter polyps to either
   current (pH 8.0, 25 degrees(C)) or future conditions (pH 7.6, 28 degrees
   C) for a further 34 d to assess potential phenotypic plastic responses
   and whether asexual offspring could benefit from parental pre-exposure.
   Polyp fitness was characterised as asexual reproduction, respiration,
   feeding, and protein concentrations. Pre-exposure to elevated
   temperature alone partially mitigated the negative effects of future
   conditions on polyp fitness, while pre-exposure to reduced pH in
   isolation completely mitigated the negative effects of future conditions
   on polyp fitness. Pre-exposure to the dual stressors, however, reduced
   fitness under future conditions relative to those in the control
   treatment. Under future conditions, polyps had higher respiration rates
   regardless of the conditions they were pre-exposed to, suggesting that
   metabolic rates will be higher under future conditions. Parent and
   daughter polyps responded similarly to the various treatments tested,
   demonstrating that parental pre-exposure did not confer any benefit to
   asexual offspring under future conditions. Importantly, we demonstrate
   that while pre-exposure to the stressors individually may allow
   Irukandji polyps to acclimate over short timescales, the stressors are
   unlikely to occur in isolation in the long term, and thus, warming and
   acidification in parallel may prevent polyp populations from acclimating
   to future ocean conditions.},

Title = {Decadal variations in CO2 during agricultural seasons in India and role
   of management as sustainable approach},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY \& INNOVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is an important greenhouse gas (GHG)
   due to its high contribution to global warming. The CO2 concentrations
   have increased significantly across the world after the
   industrialization. The anthropogenic provenance to the concentration of
   CO2 needs immediate mitigative interventions. India is a global
   agricultural powerhouse and significantly contributing to the global CO2
   levels. Here, we present the changes in CO2 concentrations between 2009
   and 2020 in India with respect to agricultural activities. We also
   propose steps to reduce yield scaled soil emissions through agricultural
   management. The CO2 concentrations in India show a steady increase of
   about 2.42 ppm/year from 2009 to 2020. The Central India (CEI), Hilly
   (HIL) and Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) show a relatively higher increase of
   about 2.43 ppm/year during the period. The highest CO2 concentration is
   observed during zaid (March to May) season, whereas the lowest CO2
   concentration is observed during kharif (June to September) season.
   Anthropogenic activities such as the high use of fossil fuels and
   biomass burning are the two factors that significantly affect
   concentrations and temporal trends of CO2 in India. A pilot-scale
   agricultural nutrient management experiment suggests that stable carbon
   alternatives like biochar can reduce soil CO2 emissions without losing
   grain yield in paddy. Therefore, our analyses provide a better
   understanding of the spatio-temporal variations of CO2 over India during
   agricultural seasons in relation to biomass burning, vegetation and
   anthropogenic activities. Furthermore, it suggests a policy implication
   for enforcing sustainable measures to reduce CO2 emissions from
   agricultural activities in India. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by

Abstract = {Changes in the seawater carbonate chemistry (ocean acidification) from
   increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations negatively
   affect many marine calcifying organisms, but may benefit primary
   producers under dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) limitation. To improve
   predictions of the ecological effects of ocean acidification, the net
   gains and losses between the processes of photosynthesis and
   calcification need to be studied jointly on physiological and population
   levels. We studied productivity, respiration, and abundances of the
   symbiont-bearing foraminifer species Marginopora vertebralis on natural
   CO2 seeps in Papua New Guinea and conducted additional studies on
   production and calcification on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) using
   artificially enhanced pCO2. Net oxygen production increased up to 90\%
   with increasing pCO2; temperature, light, and pH together explaining
   61\% of the variance in production. Production increased with increasing
   light and increasing pCO2 and declined at higher temperatures.
   Respiration was also significantly elevated (similar to 25\%), whereas
   calcification was reduced (1639\%) at low pH/high pCO2 compared to
   present-day conditions. In the field, M. vertebralis was absent at three
   CO2 seep sites at pHTotal levels below similar to 7.9 (pCO2 similar to
   700 similar to mu atm), but it was found in densities of over 1000
   similar to m-2 at all three control sites. The study showed that
   endosymbiotic algae in foraminifera benefit from increased DIC
   availability and may be naturally carbon limited. The observed reduction
   in calcification may have been caused either by increased energy demands
   for proton pumping (measured as elevated rates of respiration) or by
   stronger competition for DIC from the more productive symbionts. The net
   outcome of these two competing processes is that M. vertebralis cannot
   maintain populations under pCO2 exceeding 700 similar to mu atm, thus
   are likely to be extinct in the next century.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {117},
Month = {AUG 18},
Abstract = {During November-December 2009 community rates of gross photosynthesis
   (P-g), respiration (R) and net calcification (G(net)) were estimated
   from low-tide slack water measurements of dissolved oxygen, dissolved
   inorganic carbon and total alkalinity at the historical station DK13 One
   Tree Island reef, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Compared to
   measurements made during the 1960s-1970s at DK13 in the same season, P-g
   increased from 833 to 914 mmol O-2 center dot m(-2).d(-1) and P-g:R
   increased from 1.14 to 1.30, indicating that the reef has become more
   autotrophic. In contrast, G(net) decreased from 133 mmol C.m(-2).d(-1)
   to 74 +/- 24 mmol C.m(-2).d(-1). This decrease stems primarily from the
   threefold increase in nighttime CaCO3 dissolution from -2.5
   mmol.m(-2).h(-1) to -7.5 mmol.m(-2).h(-1). Comparison of the benthic
   community survey results from DK13 and its vicinity conducted during
   this study and in studies from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s suggest that
   there have been no significant changes in the live coral coverage during
   the past 40 years. The reduced G(net) most likely reflects the almost
   threefold increase in dissolution rates, possibly resulting from
   increased bioerosion due to changes in the biota (e.g., sea cucumbers,
   boring organisms) and/or from greater chemical dissolution produced by
   changing abiotic conditions over the past 40 years associated with
   climate change, such as increased temperatures and ocean acidification.
   However, at this stage of research on One Tree Island the effects of
   these changes are not entirely understood.},

Volume = {135},

Abstract = {The biology of symbiotic scleractinians is profoundly influenced by
   their intracellular zooxanthellae, and many studies have focused on the
   mechanistic basis of this influence. This has usually been accomplished
   by examining the metabolism of zooxanthellae under physical conditions
   measured in the open reef and assumed to be similar to conditions in
   hospite. Recent advances in the measurement of conditions near and
   within coral tissue suggests that this assumption may result in
   substantial errors. To address this possibility, the role of water flow
   in determining oxygen saturation adjacent to the tissue of Dichocoenia
   stokesii was investigated, and the effect of these measured oxygen
   saturations on the respiration and photosynthesis of zooxanthellae
   isolated from the same species was quantified. Using a microelectrode
   (700 mu m diam), we measured oxygen saturations above (less than or
   equal to 4 mm) the tissue in two flow speeds over 24 h periods in a
   flume receiving sunlight at in situ levels. The results were used as a
   proxy for ecologically relevant intracellular oxygen saturations, which
   were applied to zooxanthellae in vitro to assess their effect on
   symbiont metabolism. Microenvironment oxygen saturations (\% air
   saturation) ranged from 74-159\% in slow how (2.7 cm s(-1)) to 88-110\%
   in faster flow (7.5 cm s(-1)) over day-night cycles. Therefore, the
   metabolic rates of zooxanthellae were measured at 50 to 54\% (hypoxia),
   98 to 102\% (normoxia) and 146 to 150\% (hyperoxia) oxygen saturation.
   Oxygen saturation significantly affected the metabolism of
   zooxanthellae, with gross photosynthesis increasing 1.2-fold and dark
   respiration increasing 2-fold under hyperoxia compared to hypoxia. These
   results suggest that the metabolism of zooxanthellae in hospite is
   affected markedly by their microenvironment which, in turn, is
   influenced by flow-mediated mass transfer.},

Abstract = {Seagrasses are globally important coastal habitat-forming species, yet
   it is unknown how seagrasses respond to the combined pressures of ocean
   acidification and warming of sea surface temperature.
   We exposed three tropical species of seagrass (Cymodocea serrulata,
   Halodule uninervis, and Zostera muelleri) to increasing temperature (21,
   25, 30, and 35 degrees C) and pCO(2) (401, 1014, and 1949 mu atm) for 7
   wk in mesocosms using a controlled factorial design. Shoot density and
   leaf extension rates were recorded, and plant productivity and
   respiration were measured at increasing light levels
   (photosynthesis-irradiance curves) using oxygen optodes.
   Shoot density, growth, photosynthetic rates, and plant-scale net
   productivity occurred at 25 degrees C or 30 degrees C under saturating
   light levels. High pCO(2) enhanced maximum net productivity for
   Z.muelleri, but not in other species. Z.muelleri was the most thermally

   for the other species there was a sharp decline in productivity, growth,
   and shoot density at 35 degrees C, which was exacerbated by pCO(2).
   These results suggest that thermal stress will not be offset by ocean
   acidification during future extreme heat events and challenges the
   current hypothesis that tropical seagrass will be a winner' under future
   climate change conditions.},

Abstract = {Environmental conditions experienced by parents can have lasting effects
   on offspring. For some marine organisms, parental acclimation may
   attenuate the negative effects observed in offspring exposed to the same
   conditions. Here, development of the coral reef sea urchin Echinometra
   sp. A was examined in larvae derived from parents acclimated for 20
   months in either present-day conditions or those predicted for the year
   2100 (+ 2 degrees C/pH 7.8). Egg size was measured, and larval
   morphology, survival and respiration were quantified in larvae raised in
   present-day (26 degrees C/pH 8.1) and 2100 (28 degrees C/pH 7.8)
   treatments to near settlement to determine whether parental acclimation
   promotes greater resilience to climate change stressors. Although there
   was no difference in egg size, larvae from 2100 parents were generally
   larger and more developmentally advanced than those derived from
   present-day parents. However, negative carryover effects reduced
   survival in offspring of parents acclimated to 2100 conditions. At 15
   days post-fertilization, survival of offspring derived from 2100 parents
   was 50.6\% and 43.7\% when raised in present-day and 2100 conditions,
   respectively, compared to 59.9\% and 64.6\% in offspring derived from
   present-day parents. When raised in 2100 conditions, respiration
   declined by 36.8\% in larvae derived from present-day parents, while
   respiration rates of larvae from 2100 parents increased by 109\%,
   suggesting that carryover effects may be associated with higher energy
   consumption and physiological stress in larvae from 2100 parents.
   Although parental acclimation enhanced growth of larvae in early
   development, overall, negative carryover effects outweighed potential
   benefits of parental acclimation to ocean warming and acidification in
   this species.},

Abstract = {Synopsis New biophysical theory and electronic databases raise the
   prospect of deriving fundamental rules of life, a conceptual framework
   for how the structures and functions of molecules, cells, and individual
   organisms give rise to emergent patterns and processes of ecology,
   evolution, and biodiversity. This framework is very general, applying
   across taxa of animals from 10(-10) g protists to 10(8) g whales, and
   across environments from deserts and abyssal depths to rain forests and
   coral reefs. It has several hallmarks: (1) Energy is the ultimate
   limiting resource for organisms and the currency of biological fitness.
   (2) Most organisms are nearly equally fit, because in each generation at
   steady state they transfer an equal quantity of energy (similar to 22.4
   kJ/g) and biomass (similar to 1 g/g) to surviving offspring. This is the
   equal fitness paradigm (EFP). (3) The enormous diversity of life
   histories is due largely to variation in metabolic rates (e.g., energy
   uptake and expenditure via assimilation, respiration, and production)
   and biological times (e.g., generation time). As in standard allometric
   and metabolic theory, most physiological and life history traits scale
   approximately as quarter-power functions of body mass, m (rates as
   similar to m(-1/4) and times as similar to m(1/4)), and as exponential
   functions of temperature. (4) Time is the fourth dimension of life.
   Generation time is the pace of life. (5) There is, however, considerable
   variation not accounted for by the above scalings and existing theories.
   Much of this ``unexplained{''} variation is due to natural selection on
   life history traits to adapt the biological times of generations to the
   clock times of geochronological environmental cycles. (6) Most work on
   biological scaling and metabolic ecology has focused on respiration
   rate. The emerging synthesis applies conceptual foundations of
   energetics and the EFP to shift the focus to production rate and
   generation time.},

Abstract = {Ocean acidification and warming, fueled by excess atmospheric carbon
   dioxide, can impose stress on marine organisms. Most studies testing the
   effects of climate change on marine organisms, however, use extreme
   climate projection scenarios, despite moderate projections scenarios
   being most likely to occur. Here, we examined the interactive effects of
   warming and acidification on reproduction, respiration, mobility and
   metabolic composition of polyps of the Irukandji jellyfish, Carukia
   barnesi, to determine the responses of a cubozoan jellyfish to moderate
   and extreme climate scenarios in Queensland, Australia. The experiment
   consisted two orthogonal factors: temperature (current 25 degrees C and
   future 28 degrees C) and pH (current (8.0) moderate (7.9) and extreme
   (7.7)). All polyps survived in the experiment but fewer polyps were
   produced in the pH 7.7 treatment compared to pH 7.9 and pH 8.0.
   Respiration rates were elevated in the lowest pH treatment throughout
   most of the experiment and polyps were approximately half as mobile in
   this treatment compared to pH 7.9 and pH 8.0, regardless of temperature.
   We identified metabolites occurring at significantly lower relative
   abundance in the lowest pH (i.e. glutamate, acetate, betaine,
   methylguanidine, lysine, sarcosine, glycine) and elevated temperature
   (i.e. proline, trigonelline, creatinine, mannose, acetate, betaine,
   methylguanidine, lysine, sarcosine) treatments. Glycine was the only
   metabolite exhibiting an interactive effect between pH and temperature.
   Our results suggest that C. barnesi polyps are unaffected by the most
   optimistic climate scenario and may tolerate even extreme climate
   conditions to some extent. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations are driving changes in ocean
   chemistry at unprecedented rates resulting in ocean acidification, which
   is predicted to impact the functioning of marine biota, in particular of
   marine calcifiers. However, the precise understanding of such impacts
   relies on an analytical system that determines the mechanisms and impact
   of elevated pCO(2) on the physiology of organisms at scales from species
   to entire communities. Recent work has highlighted the need within
   experiments to control all aspects of the carbonate system to resolve
   the role of different inorganic carbon species on the physiological
   responses observed across taxa in real-time. Presently however, there
   are limited options available for continuous quantification of
   physiological responses, coupled with real-time calculation of the
   seawater carbonate chemistry system within microcosm environments. Here,
   we describe and characterise the performance of a novel pCO(2) membrane
   equilibrium system (the Membrane Inlet Infra-Red Gas Analyser, MI-IRGA)
   integrated with a continuous pH and oxygen monitoring platform. The
   system can detect changes in the seawater carbonate chemistry and
   determine organism physiological responses, while providing the user
   with real-time control over the microcosm system. We evaluate the
   systems control, response time and associated error, and demonstrate the
   flexibility of the system to operate under field conditions and within a
   laboratory. We use the system to measure physiological parameters
   (photosynthesis and respiration) for the corals Pocillipora damicornis
   and Porites cylindrica; in doing so we present a novel dataset examining
   the interactive role of temperature, light and pCO(2) on the physiology

Volume = {141},
Pages = {70-78},

Abstract = {Ocean acidification and warming are predicted to affect the early life
   of many marine organisms, but their effects can be synergistic or
   antagonistic. This study assessed the combined effects of near-future
   (2100) ocean acidification (pH 7.8) and warming (+3 degrees C) on the
   fertilization, larval development and growth of the green sea urchin,
   Lytechinus variegatus, common in tropical reefs of Florida and the
   Caribbean. Acidification had no effect on fertilization, but delayed
   larval development, stunted growth, and increased asymmetry. Warming
   decreased fertilization success when the sperm:egg ratio was higher
   (1847:1), accelerated larval development, but had no effect on growth.
   When exposed to both acidification and warming, fertilization rates
   decreased, larval development accelerated (due to increased
   respiration/metabolism), but larvae were smaller and more asymmetric,
   meaning acidification and warming had additive effects. Thus, climate
   change is expected to decrease the abundance of this important
   herbivore, exacerbating macroalgal growth and dominance on coral reefs.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},

Abstract = {Turf algae are a very important component of coral reefs, featuring high
   growth and turnover rates, whilst covering large areas of substrate. As
   food for many organisms, turf algae have an important role in the
   ecosystem. Farming damselfish can modify the species composition and
   productivity of such algal assemblages, while defending them against
   intruders. Like all organisms however, turf algae and damselfishes have
   the potential to be affected by future changes in seawater (SW)
   temperature and pCO(2). In this study, algal assemblages, in the
   presence and absence of farming Pomacentrus wardi were exposed to two
   combinations of SW temperature and pCO2 levels projected for the austral
   spring of 2100 (the B1 ``reduced{''} and the A1FI
   ``business-as-usual{''} CO2 emission scenarios) at Heron Island (GBR,
   Australia). These assemblages were dominated by the presence of red
   algae and non-epiphytic cyanobacteria, i.e. cyanobacteria that grow
   attached to the substrate rather than on filamentous algae. The endpoint
   algal composition was mostly controlled by the presence/absence of
   farming damselfish, despite a large variability found between the algal
   assemblages of individual fish. Different scenarios appeared to be
   responsible for a mild, species specific change in community
   composition, observable in some brown and green algae, but only in the
   absence of farming fish. Farming fish appeared unaffected by the
   conditions to which they were exposed. Algal biomass reductions were
   found under ``reduced{''} CO2 emission, but not ``business-as-usual{''}
   scenarios. This suggests that action taken to limit CO2 emissions may,
   if the majority of algae behave similarly across all seasons, reduce the
   potential for phase shifts that lead to algal dominated communities. At
   the same time the availability of food resources to damselfish and other
   herbivores would be smaller under ``reduced{''} emission scenarios.},

Abstract = {Ocean warming is an extreme environment event that has profound and
   lasting impacts on Symbiodiniaceae. However, their response mechanisms
   to elevated temperature exposure are poorly understood. In this study,
   the physiological and transcriptional responses of Effrenium voratum
   (Symbiodiniaceae) to ocean warming were examined. After exposure to 30
   ??C, no significant variations in growth, chlorophyll a, or
   photosynthetic and respiration rates were observed, while a higher
   temperature (34 ??C) significantly reduced these physiological
   measurements. Meanwhile, lipid content and fatty acid composition were
   altered at high temperature (i.e., elevated degree of fatty acid
   saturation). Such biochemical constituents likely contributed to the
   mitigation of the negative effects of elevated temperatures.
   Furthermore, higher expression levels of genes related to the synthesis
   and elongation of fatty acids were detected at high temperature. The
   adjustment of lipids and fatty acid composition may be a potential
   mechanism by which E. voratum may survive under future global warming.

Abstract = {The total rate of N-waste excretion (M (N)) in juvenile tambaqui living
   in ion-poor Amazonian water comprised 85 \% ammonia-N (M (Amm-N)) and 15
   \% urea-N (M (Urea-N)). Both occurred mainly across the gills with only
   similar to 5 \% of M (Amm-N) and similar to 39 \% of M (Urea-N) via the
   urine. Tambaqui were not especially tolerant to high environmental
   ammonia (HEA), despite their great resistance to other environmental
   factors. Nevertheless, they were able to maintain a continued elevation
   of M (Amm-N) during and after 48-h exposure to 2.5 mmol L-1 HEA. The
   normally negative transepithelial potential (-18 mV) increased to -9 mV
   during the HEA period, which would help to reduce branchial NH4 (+)
   entry. During 3 h of acute environmental hypoxia (30 \% saturation), M
   (Amm-N) declined, and recovered thereafter, similar to the response seen
   in other hypoxia-tolerant teleosts; M (Urea-N) did not change. However,
   during gradual hypoxia, M (Amm-N) remained constant, but M (Urea-N)
   eventually fell. The acute temperature sensitivities of M (Amm-N) and M
   (N) were low from 28 A degrees C (acclimation) to 33 A degrees C (Q10
   similar to 1.5), but high (similar to 3.8) from 33 to 38 A degrees C,
   relative to (similar to 1.9 throughout). In contrast, M (Urea-N)
   exhibited a different pattern over these temperature ranges (Q10 2.6 and
   2.1, respectively). The nitrogen quotient (NQ = 0.16-0.23) was high at
   all temperatures, indicating a 60-85 \% reliance on protein to fuel
   aerobic metabolism in these fasting animals. During steady-state aerobic
   exercise, and M (Urea-N) increased in parallel with velocity (up to 3.45
   body lengths s(-1)), but M (Amm) (and thus M (N)) remained approximately
   constant. Therefore, the NQ fell progressively, indicating a decreasing
   reliance on protein-based fuels, as work load increased. In group
   feeding trials using 45 \% protein commercial pellets, tambaqui excreted
   82 \% (range 39-170 \%) of the dietary N within 24 h; N-retention
   efficiency was inversely related to the ration voluntarily consumed. M
   (Amm-N) peaked at 4-6 h, and M (Urea-N) at 6-9-h post-feeding, with an
   additional peak in M (Amm-N) only at 21 h. During subsequent fasting, M
   (N) stabilized at a high endogenous rate from 2 through 8 days
   post-feeding. Possible reasons for the high wasting of protein-N during
   both fasting and feeding are discussed.},

Abstract = {Productivity and calcification were measured across a small,

   across the reef patch with the current and measuring changes in oxygen
   concentration and pH together with water temperature and light intensity
   (photosynthetically active radiation). Average rates of photosynthesis,
   respiration, calcification and solution of reef rock were estimated for
   the reef patch at different times of the day and, hence, at different
   light intensities. Light response curves were constructed for
   productivity and calcification and used, together with the diurnal light
   regime, to provide estimates for daily metabolic performance. Gross
   productivity for the reef patch was 12.3 gC . m-2 . d-1. The production:
   respiration ratio was 1.6:1. Net calcification was 16.3 gCaCO3 . m-2  .
   d-1, which extrapolates to 6.0 kgCaCO3 . m-2 . year-1. Although the reef
   is growing at high latitude, in a hypersaline environment, and is

Title = {The Response of the Mediterranean Gorgonian Eunicella singularis to
   Thermal Stress Is Independent of Its Nutritional Regime},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 8},
Abstract = {Over the last few decades, sessile benthic organisms from the
   Mediterranean Sea have suffered from the global warming of the world's
   oceans, and several mass mortality events were observed during warm
   summers. It has been hypothesized that mortality could have been due to
   a nutrient (food) shortage following the stratification of the water
   column. However, the symbiotic gorgonian Eunicella singularis has also
   presented a locally exceptional mortality, despite its autotrophic
   capacities through the photosynthesis of its dinoflagellate symbionts.
   Thus, this study has experimentally investigated the response of E.
   singularis to a thermal stress (temperature increase from 18 to 26
   degrees C), with colonies maintained more than 2 months under four
   nutritional diets: autotrophy only (AO), autotrophy and inorganic
   nitrogen addition (AN), autotrophy and heterotrophy (AH), heterotrophy
   only (HO). At 18 degrees C, and contrary to many other anthozoans,
   supplementation of autotrophy with either inorganic nitrogen or food
   (heterotrophy) had no effect on the rates of respiration,
   photosynthesis, as well as in the chlorophyll, lipid and protein
   content. In the dark, heterotrophy maintained the gorgonian's
   metabolism, except a bleaching (loss of pigments), which did not affect
   the rates of photosynthesis. At 24 degrees C, rates of respiration, and
   photosynthesis significantly decreased in all treatments. At 26 degrees
   C, in addition to a decrease in the lipid content of all treatments, a
   bleaching was observed after 1 week in the AO treatment, while the AH
   and AN treatments resisted three weeks before bleaching. These last
   results suggest that, temperatures above 24 degrees C impair the
   energetic reserves of this species and might explain the mortality
   events in the Mediterranean.},

Title = {Component-specific dynamics of riverine mangrove CO2 efflux in the
   Florida coastal Everglades},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {213},

Abstract = {Carbon cycling in mangrove forests represents a significant portion of
   the coastal wetland carbon (C) budget across the latitudes of the
   tropics and subtropics. Previous research suggests fluctuations in tidal
   inundation, temperature and salinity can influence forest metabolism and
   C cycling. Carbon dioxide (CO2) from respiration that occurs from below
   the canopy is contributed from different components. In this study, we
   investigated variation in CO2 flux among different below-canopy
   components (soil, leaf litter, course woody debris, soil including
   pneumatophores, prop roots, and surface water) in a riverine mangrove
   forest of Shark River Slough estuary, Everglades National Park (Florida,
   USA). The range in CO2 flux from different components exceeded that
   measured among sites along the oligohaline-saline gradient. Black
   mangrove (Avicennia germinans) pneumatophores contributed the largest
   average CO2 flux. Over a narrow range of estuarine salinity (25-35
   practical salinity units (PSU)), increased salinity resulted in lower
   CO2 flux to the atmosphere. Tidal inundation reduced soil CO2 flux
   overall but increased the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) observed in
   the overlying surface water upon flooding. Higher pCO(2) in surface
   water is then subject to tidally driven export, largely as HCO3.
   Integration and scaling of CO2 flux rates to forest scale allowed for
   improved understanding of the relative contribution of different
   below-canopy components to mangrove forest ecosystem respiration (ER).
   Summing component CO2 fluxes suggests a more significant contribution of
   below-canopy respiration to ER than previously considered. An
   understanding of below-canopy CO2 component fluxes and their
   contributions to ER can help to elucidate how C cycling will change with
   discrete disturbance events (e.g., hurricanes) and long-term change,
   including sea-level rise, and potential impact mangrove forests. As
   such, key controls on below-canopy ER must be taken into consideration
   when developing and modeling mangrove forest C budgets. (C) 2015

Title = {Physiological and biochemical responses of a coralline alga and a sea
   urchin to climate change: Implications for herbivory},
Journal = {MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {142},
Pages = {100-107},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Direct responses to rising temperatures and ocean acidification are
   increasingly well known for many single species, yet recent reviews have
   highlighted the need for climate change research to consider a broader
   range of species, how stressors may interact, and how stressors may
   affect species interactions. The latter point is important in the
   context of plant-herbivore interactions, as increasing evidence shows
   that increasing seawater temperature and/or acidification can alter
   algal traits that dictate their susceptibility to herbivores, and
   subsequently, community and ecosystem properties. To better understand
   how marine rocky shore environments will be affected by a changing
   ocean, in the present study we investigated the direct effects of
   short-term, co-occurring increased temperature and ocean acidification
   on a coralline alga (Jania rubens) and a sea urchin herbivore
   (Echinometra lucunter) and assessed the indirect effects of these
   factors on the algal-herbivore interaction. A 21-day mesocosm experiment
   was conducted with both algae and sea urchins exposed to ambient (24
   degrees C, Low CO2), high-temperature (28 degrees C, Low CO2), acidified
   (24 degrees C, High CO2), or high-temperature plus acidified (28 degrees
   C, High CO2) conditions. Algal photosynthesis, respiration, and phenolic
   content were unaffected by increased temperature and CO2, but calcium
   carbonate content was reduced under high CO2 treatments in both
   temperatures, while total sugar content of the algae was reduced under
   acidified, lower temperature conditions. Metabolic rates of the sea
   urchin were elevated in the lower temperature, high CO2 treatment, and
   feeding assays showed that consumption rates also increased in this
   treatment. Despite some changes to algal chemical composition, it
   appears that at least under short-term exposure to climate change
   conditions, direct effects on herbivore metabolism dictated herbivory
   rates, while indirect effects caused by changes in algal palatability
   seemed to be of minor importance.},

Abstract = {Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have been suggested to be
   possible mechanisms underlying hybrid breakdown, as a result of
   mito-nuclear incompatibilities in respiratory complexes of the electron
   transport system. However, it remains unclear whether hybridization
   increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by
   mitochondria. We used high-resolution respirometry and fluorometry on
   isolatedliver mitochondria to examine mitochondrial physiology and
   ROSemission in naturally occurring hybrids of pumpkinseed (Lepomis
   gibbosus) and bluegill (L. macrochirus). ROS emission was greater in
   hybridsthan in both parent species when respiration was supported
   bycomplex I (but not complex II)substrates, and was associated with
   increases in lipid peroxidation.However, respiratory capacitiesfor
   oxidative phosphorylation, phosphorylation efficiency, and O(2)kinetics
   inhybrids were intermediate between those in parental species. Flux
   control ratios of capacities for electron transport (measured in
   uncoupled mitochondria) relative to oxidative phosphorylation suggested
   that the limiting influence of the phosphorylation system is reduced in
   hybrids. This likely helped offset impairments in electron transport
   capacity and complex III activity, but contributed to augmenting ROS
   production.Therefore, hybridization can increase mitochondrial ROS
   production, in support of previous suggestions that mitochondrial
   dysfunction can induce oxidative stress and thus contribute to
   hybridbreakdown.},

Volume = {58},

Abstract = {Measurements have been made of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen isotope
   compositions of inclusion waters and CO2 extracted from eleven species
   of modem marine and freshwater skeletal carbonates. The samples were
   collected in environments of highly contrasting temperatures and
   isotopic compositions of ambient waters. Inclusion waters were extracted
   in vacuum by thermal decrepitation of samples that were previously
   treated with H2O2 to remove organic matter. Water extractions were
   quantitative above 200-degrees-C for aragonite species and above
   350-400-degrees-C for calcite species. Amounts of water liberated ranged
   from 0.6\% to 2.2\% and were generally very reproducible within a
   species but varied strongly from one species to another. Except for red
   algae and corals, the deltaO-18 values of the shells are in accord with
   crystallization of carbonate at or near equilibrium with marine water of
   deltaO-18 near 0 parts per thousand. The inclusion waters, however, are
   not in oxygen isotope equilibrium with ambient water and have high
   deltaO-18 values of +6 to +18 parts per thousand. These high deltaO-18
   values do not result from partial exchange between water and either the
   host carbonate or small amounts of CO2 released during decrepitation.
   deltaD values of inclusion waters range from -80 to -10 parts per
   thousand and are sensitive to the presence of small amounts of organic
   matter. The data for each species define a distinct field in
   deltaD-deltaO-18 space that is controlled by a vital fractionation
   effect. Stable isotope compositions of inclusion waters can be explained
   by metabolic reactions that incorporate relatively O-18-rich O2 that is
   dissolved in the water and used by the organism in respiration. Thus,
   inclusion waters in shells probably represent remnants of metabolic
   fluids produced by the mantle epithelium. The stable isotope
   compositions of such waters most likely result from varying metabolic
   rates that are specific to each species, as well as to formation
   temperature and the isotopic composition of ambient waters.
   Inclusion fluids in biogenic carbonates constitute an isotopic reservoir
   that has heretofore been unrecognized. The deltaO-18 and deltaD values
   of the inclusion waters are very different from those of meteoric,
   magmatic, and seawaters. Because these trapped fluids are released by
   the shells during heating, they could play a role in burial diagenesis.
   Burial of significant amounts of biogenic carbonates could liberate
   enough water to control diagenetic or metamorphic reactions in some
   cases. In the absence of other types of fluids, the participation of
   inclusion waters in such reactions should be easily recognized by their
   distinctive isotopic compositions.},

Volume = {52},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We studied the photosynthetic acclimatization of two populations of
   Asparagopsis taxiformis from two biogeographic regions (Santa Catalina
   Island, California, and Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii) in two seasons. We compared
   thermal variability between locations and estimated the environmental
   optima and tolerance limits of photosynthesis to understand the
   relationship between phenotypic plasticity and thermal variability at
   each location. Photosynthetic performance was assessed using oxygen
   evolution and pulsed amplitude modulated fluorometry to quantify
   responses to thermal variation. A. taxiformis from both locations had
   similar high temperature tolerances for maximum net photosynthesis
   (Pnet(max)) and maximum relative electron transport rate rETR(max)
   (similar to 30 degrees C), but different cold temperature tolerances.
   Respiration rates from both locations (summer and winter) always
   increased above 25 degrees C. Chlorophyll fluorescence yield from
   dark-adapted samples from both locations decreased at warmer
   temperatures in the winter and at colder temperatures during the summer.
   Populations exposed to greater thermal variability (across both short
   and long time scales) displayed greater capacity for photosynthetic
   acclimatization. A. taxiformis from California showed seasonal changes
   in photosynthetic performance within the environmental temperature range
   (14-21 degrees C), whereas individuals from Hawaii did not. The narrower
   temperature tolerance (short-term response) of subtropical Asparagopsis
   may make it more susceptible than temperate populations to the predicted
   increases in global sea surface temperatures. Acclimatization of
   photosynthesis may play an important role in enabling A. taxiformis to
   respond to a variable environment and to persist in different
   biogeographic regions.},

Abstract = {The impact of elevated CO2 and temperature on photosynthesis and
   calcification in the symbiont-bearing benthic foraminifer Marginopora
   vertebralis was studied. Individual specimens of M. vertebralis were
   collected from Heron Island on the southern Great Barrier Reef
   (Australia). They were maintained for 5 weeks at different temperatures
   (28, 32 A degrees C) and pCO(2) (400, 1,000 A mu atm) levels spanning a
   range of current and future climate-change scenarios. The photosynthetic
   capacity of M. vertebralis was measured with O-2 microsensors and a
   pulse-amplitude-modulated chlorophyll (Chl) fluorometer, in combination
   with estimates of Chl a and Chl c (2) concentrations and calcification
   rates. After 5 weeks, control specimens remained unaltered for all
   parameters. Chlorophyll a concentrations significantly decreased in the
   specimens at 1,000 A mu atm CO2 for both temperatures, while no change
   in Chl c (2) concentration was observed. Photoinhibition was observed
   under elevated CO2 and temperature, with a 70-80 \% decrease in the
   maximum quantum yield of PSII. There was no net O-2 production at
   elevated temperatures in both CO2 treatments as compared to the control
   temperature, supporting that temperature has more impact on
   photosynthesis and O-2 flux than changes in ambient CO2. Photosynthetic
   pigment loss and a decrease in photochemical efficiency are thus likely
   to occur with increased temperature. The elevated CO2 and high
   temperature treatment also lead to a reduction in calcification rate
   (from +0.1 to >-0.1 \% day(-1)). Thus, both calcification and
   photosynthesis of the major sediment-producing foraminifer M.
   vertebralis appears highly vulnerable to elevated temperature and ocean
   acidification scenarios predicted in climate-change models.},

Abstract = {Southern Florida's Everglades are at the front line of potential
   negative effects on aquatic ecosystems from climate change and
   associated sea-level rise. A diversity of aquatic habitats supports a
   rich assemblage of aquatic and terrestrial wildlife, including 36
   vertebrates and 26 plant species federally listed as endangered,
   threatened, or candidate species. Anticipated climate-change trends for
   southern Florida include increased weather uncertainty with more
   droughts, higher temperatures, and an increased number of more intense
   storms. Hydrologic regimes, temperature, and CO2 have been strongly
   correlated with plant community structure, coral and fish abundance and
   diversity, and higher trophic-level responses. Higher levels of
   variability in extreme climatic events, such as droughts, have the
   potential to destabilize aquatic communities. Sea-level rise is expected
   to be 0.8 to 2 m over the next century, a serious problem in a landscape
   that rises only 5 cm/km from Florida Bay inland. Wading birds and other
   wildlife species dependent on fresh water are likely to decline because
   of salt-water overwash and inundation. In addition to causing habitat
   loss, saltwater inundation of the peat substrate of Everglades
   freshwater wetlands may increase C emissions from sequestered C released

Title = {The impact of oyster aquaculture on the estuarine carbonate system},
Journal = {ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 7},
Abstract = {Many studies have examined the vulnerability of calcifying organisms,
   such as the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), to externally forced
   ocean acidification, but the opposite interaction whereby oysters alter
   their local carbonate conditions has received far less attention. We
   present an exploratory model for isolating the impact that net
   calcification and respiration of aquacultured eastern oysters can have
   on calcite and aragonite saturation states, in the context of varying
   temperature, ocean-estuary mixing, and air-sea gas exchange. We apply
   the model to the Damariscotta River Estuary in Maine which has
   experienced rapid expansion of oyster aquaculture in the last decade.
   Our model uses oyster shell growth over the summer season and a
   previously derived relationship between net calcification and
   respiration to quantify impacts of net oyster calcification and gross
   metabolism on carbonate saturation states in open tidal waters. Under
   2018 industry size and climate conditions, we estimate that oysters can
   lower carbonate saturation states by up to 5\% (i.e., 0.17 and 0.11
   units on calcite and aragonite saturation states, respectively) per day
   in late summer, with an average of 3\% over the growing season.
   Perturbations from temperature and air-sea exchange are similar in
   magnitude. Under 2050 climate conditions and 2018 industry size, calcite
   saturation state will decrease by up to an additional 0.54 units. If the
   industry expands 3-fold by 2050, the calcite and aragonite saturation
   states may decrease by 0.73 and 0.47 units, respectively, on average for
   the latter half of the growing season when compared to 2018 climate
   conditions and industry size. Collectively, our results indicate that
   dense aggregations of oysters can have a significant role on estuarine
   carbonate chemistry.},

   A ``smart glove{''} (Skin potential and conductance, skin temperature),
   A wrist device (amplification, wireless data transmission)
   A data logger ( continuous recording)
   All the sensors are non invasive. Marsian can be used for the
   measurement of the autonomous nervous system activity, which provides
   information upon the emotional, sensorial,, intellectual and task

   The methodology has been already used for the stud), of the driver's

Journal = {LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {373-383},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We present a measuring procedure that allows the quantification of gross
   photosynthesis at the ambient light intensity, P(I), from light
   transition measurements similar to those employed in the light-dark
   shift method but without the necessity of achieving complete darkness.
   The method is thus more readily applicable in situ, where, during
   daylight, complete sample darkening is very difficult or even impossible
   to achieve. The procedure involves rapid microsensor-based monitoring of
   oxygen in the sample during a series of light transitions from ambient
   light intensity to a few intermediate levels, and determination of the
   initial rates of oxygen decrease during each partial darkening (shading)
   period. P(I) is then recovered by fitting the measured rates with a
   function derived from the model describing the change in photosynthesis
   rate with light intensity (P-I curve) and extrapolating it to the full
   light-to-dark transition. We validated this approach in the lab on coral
   and microbial mat samples and found that a satisfactory estimate of P(I)
   can be obtained with as few as 4-5 shade levels. We also applied the

Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 28},
Abstract = {The mutualistic symbiosis between anthozoans and intra-gastrodermal
   dinoflagellates of the family Symbiodiniaceae is the functional basis of
   all coral reef ecosystems, with the latter providing up to 95\% of their
   fixed photosynthate to their hosts in exchange for nutrients. However,
   recent studies of sponges, jellyfish, and anemones have revealed the
   potential for this mutualistic relationship to shift to parasitism under
   stressful conditions. Over a period of eight weeks, we compared the
   physiological conditions of both inoculated and aposymbiotic anemones
   (Exaiptasia pallida) that were either fed or starved. By the sixth week,
   both fed groups of anemones were significantly larger than their starved
   counterparts. Moreover, inoculated and starved anemones tended to
   disintegrate into ``tissue balls{''} within eight weeks, and 25\% of the
   samples died; in contrast, starved aposymbiotic anemones required six
   months to form tissue balls, and no anemones from this group died. Our
   results show that the dinoflagellates within inoculated anemones may
   have posed a fatal metabolic burden on their hosts during starvation;
   this may be because of the need to prioritize their own metabolism and
   nourishment at the expense of their hosts. Collectively, our study
   reveals the potential of this dynamic symbiotic association to shift
   away from mutualism during food-deprived conditions.},

Abstract = {Carbon dioxide exchange between the atmosphere and forested subtropical

   characterizing this atmospheric ecosystem carbon (C) exchange, for
   cypress strands and pine forests in the Greater Everglades of Florida as
   measured with eddy covariance methods at three locations (Cypress Swamp,

   cycles are also examined at these three sites, as are methane emission
   measured only at the Dwarf Cypress site. Each forested wetland showed
   net C uptake from the atmosphere both monthly and annually, as indicated
   by the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2). For this
   study, NEE is the difference between photosynthesis and respiration,
   with negative values representing uptake from the atmosphere that is
   retained in the ecosystem or transported laterally via overland flow
   (unmeasured for this study). Atmospheric C uptake (NEE) was greatest at
   the Cypress Swampp (-900 to -1000 g C m(2) yr(-1)), moderate at the Pine
   Upland (-650 to -700 g C m(2) yr(-1)) and least at the Dwarf Cypress
   (-400 to -450 g C m(2) yr(-1)). Changes in NEE were clearly a function
   of seasonality in solar insolation, air temperature and flooding, which
   suppressed heterotrophic soil respiration. We also note that changes in
   the satellite-derived enhanced vegetation index (EVI) served as a useful
   surrogate for changes in NEE at these forested wetland sites.},

Abstract = {Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations shape the biogeochemistry and

   Using high-resolution, in situ DO time-series collected over the course
   of a year in a novel marine ecosystem (Jellyfish Lake, Palau), we show
   that DO declined throughout the marine lake and subsequently recovered
   in the upper water column. These shifts were accompanied by variations
   in water temperature and were correlated to changes in wind,

   consumption and production did not accelerate nor collapse; instead,
   their variance increased during lake deoxygenation and recovery, and
   then stabilized. Spatial and temporal variations in rates were
   significantly related to climatic variability and changes in DO, and
   causality testing indicated that these relationships were both

   producing linked feedbacks that drove DO decline and recovery.},

Abstract = {Stable endosymbiotic relationships between cnidarian animals and
   dinoflagellate algae are vital for sustaining coral reef ecosystems.
   Recent studies have shown that elevated seawater temperatures can cause
   the collapse of their endosymbiosis, known as `bleaching', and result in
   mass mortality. However, the molecular interplay between temperature
   responses and symbiotic states still remains unclear. To identify
   candidate genes relevant to the symbiotic stability, we performed
   transcriptomic analyses under multiple conditions using the symbiotic
   and apo-symbiotic (symbiont free) Exaiptasia diaphana, an emerging model
   sea anemone. Gene expression patterns showed that large parts of
   differentially expressed genes in response to heat stress were specific
   to the symbiotic state, suggesting that the host sea anemone could react
   to environmental changes in a symbiotic state-dependent manner.
   Comparative analysis of expression profiles under multiple conditions
   highlighted candidate genes potentially important in the symbiotic state
   transition under heat-induced bleaching. Many of these genes were
   functionally associated with carbohydrate and protein metabolisms in
   lysosomes. Symbiont algal genes differentially expressed in hospite
   encode proteins related to heat shock response, calcium signaling,
   organellar protein transport, and sugar metabolism. Our data suggest
   that heat stress alters gene expression in both the hosts and symbionts.
   In particular, heat stress may affect the lysosome-mediated degradation
   and transportation of substrates such as carbohydrates through the
   symbiosome (phagosome-derived organelle harboring symbiont) membrane,
   which potentially might attenuate the stability of symbiosis and lead to
   bleaching-associated symbiotic state transition.},

Abstract = {Tropical seagrasses experience considerable spatio-temporal changes with
   light and other biogeochemical conditions and adopt species-specific
   acclimatization strategies. Variation in photo-acclimatory responses of
   three tropical seagrass species (Cymodocea serrulata,Thalassia
   hemprichii, andEnhalus acoroides) was studied by measuring
   photosynthetic electron transport rates (ETR) using Pulse Amplitude
   Modulated (PAM) fluorometry. Quantitative values of ETR and rates of
   photosynthetic O(2)evolution (net O(2)exchange corrected for dark
   respiration) were compared to establish species-specific relationships
   in shallow water conditions. The apparent average molar ratio of
   O(2)evolution to ETR for the studied species found lower than the
   theoretical value (0.25). The highest photosynthetic activity (ETRmax)
   varied significantly among the three studied species in the decreasing
   order as:E. acoroides(59.27);T. hemprichii(54.06), andC.
   serrulata(46.72). The effective quantum yield (Y) of PS II (Photosystem
   II), one of the most useful indicators of stress conditions for
   seagrass, was observed to be significantly higher forE.
   acoroidescompared to the other two species. It appears that the
   variations in water temperature and pCO(2)could significantly alter the
   photosynthetic characteristics of these shallow water seagrass species.
   This study is useful in predicting the photo-acclimation strategies to
   any change in light availability and subsequent biogeochemical changes

Abstract = {Estimates of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release by marine macrophyte
   communities (seagrass meadows and macroalgal beds) based on in situ
   benthic chambers from published and unpublished are compiled in this
   study. The effect of temperature and light availability on DOC release
   by macrophyte communities was examined. Almost 85\% of the seagrass
   communities and all of macroalgal communities examined acted as net
   sources of DOC. Net DOC fluxes in seagrass communities increase
   positively with water temperature. In macroalgal communities net DOC
   fluxes under light exceeded those under dark condition, however, this
   trend was weaker in seagrass communities. Shading of a mixed seagrass
   meadow in The Philippines led to a significant reduction on the net DOC
   release when shading was maintained for 6 days compared to only 2 days
   of shading. Net DOC fluxes increased with increasing community
   respiration, but were independent of primary production or net community
   production. The estimated global net DOC flux, and hence export, from
   marine macrophytes is about 0.158 +/- 0.055 or 0.175 +/- 0.056 Pg C

Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {2145-2158},
Abstract = {Despite the importance of mangrove ecosystems in the global carbon
   budget, the relationships between environmental drivers and carbon
   dynamics in these forests remain poorly understood. This limited
   understanding is partly a result of the challenges associated with in
   situ flux studies. Tower-based CO2 eddy covariance (EC) systems are
   installed in only a few mangrove forests worldwide, and the longest EC
   record from the Florida Everglades contains less than 9 years of
   observations. A primary goal of the present study was to develop a
   methodology to estimate canopy-scale photosynthetic light use efficiency
   in this forest. These tower-based observations represent a basis for
   associating CO2 fluxes with canopy light use properties, and thus
   provide the means for utilizing satellite-based reflectance data for
   larger scale investigations. We present a model for mangrove canopy
   light use efficiency utilizing the enhanced green vegetation index (EVI)
   derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
   that is capable of predicting changes in mangrove forest CO2 fluxes
   caused by a hurricane disturbance and changes in regional environmental
   conditions, including temperature and salinity. Model parameters are
   solved for in a Bayesian framework. The model structure requires
   estimates of ecosystem respiration (RE), and we present the first ever
   tower-based estimates of mangrove forest RE derived from nighttime CO2
   fluxes. Our investigation is also the first to show the effects of
   salinity on mangrove forest CO2 uptake, which declines 5\% per each 10
   parts per thousand (ppt) increase in salinity. Light use efficiency in
   this forest declines with increasing daily photosynthetic active
   radiation, which is an important departure from the assumption of
   constant light use efficiency typically applied in satellite-driven
   models. The model developed here provides a framework for estimating CO2
   uptake by these forests from reflectance data and information about
   environmental conditions.},

Journal = {AQUATIC BOTANY},

Abstract = {The specific growth rate of a brown alga, Sargassum macrocarpum, was
   evaluated by supplying bio-filtered wastewater (BFW) and synthetic
   nutrient medium (SNM) adjusted to the same nutrient concentration as
   BFW. The nutrient uptake characteristics were examined under various
   temperature conditions. The growth rates in the 0.5\% and 5.0\% (v/v)
   BFW treatments (0.015-0.025 wet weight day(-1)) were approximately the
   same as those in the 0.5\% and 5.0\% (v/v) SNM treatments (0.016-0.023
   wet weight day(-1)), and were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those
   in the non-enriched treatment (control) (0.006 day(-1)). The total
   phosphorus contents in 5.0\% (v/v) BFW and SNM were significantly higher
   than those of the initial values (p < 0.01) because of excess phosphorus
   supplied above their demand. These results suggested that BFW can be
   utilized for seaweed growth and contribute to phosphorus accumulation in
   seaweed tissues. The maximum uptake rate (Vmax) for phosphate at a
   temperature ranging from 15 degrees C to 25 degrees C was constant
   (0.40-0.45 mu mol g(-1) (dry weight) hrs(-1)), and increased at 30
   degrees C (0.69 mu mol g(-1)-(dry weight) hrs(-1)) probably because of
   their high phosphate demand induced by high respiration rate. The ratio
   of V max to K m for phosphate generally increased with increasing
   temperature (0.09 +/- 0.02-0.27 +/- 0.09), which was characterized as
   demand-driven uptake. These results indicated that fertilization effects
   based on the physiological response of seaweeds in response to
   temperature changes need to be considered when providing
   wastewater-derived nutrients.},

Abstract = {Oceanic and coastal waters are acidifying due to processes dominated in
   the open ocean by increasing atmospheric CO2 and dominated in estuaries
   and some coastal waters by nutrient-fueled respiration. The patterns and
   severity of acidification, as well as its effects, are modified by the
   host of stressors related to human activities that also influence these
   habitats. Temperature, deoxygenation, and changes in food webs are
   particularly important co-stressors because they are pervasive, and both
   their causes and effects are often mechanistically linked to
   acidification. Development of a theoretical underpinning to multiple
   stressor research that considers physiological, ecological, and
   evolutionary perspectives is needed because testing all combinations of
   stressors and stressor intensities experimentally is impossible.
   Nevertheless, use of a wide variety of research approaches is a logical
   and promising strategy for improving understanding of acidification and
   its effects. Future research that focuses on spatial and temporal
   patterns of stressor interactions and on identifying mechanisms by which
   multiple stressors affect individuals, populations, and ecosystems is
   critical. It is also necessary to incorporate consideration of multiple
   stressors into management, mitigation, and adaptation to acidification
   and to increase public and policy recognition of the importance of
   addressing acidification in the context of the suite of other stressors
   with which it potentially interacts.},

Abstract = {Tropical coastal systems are particularly prone to periods of
   environmental hypoxia, which can result from organismal respiration as
   well as thermal stratification, and may be further exacerbated by
   anthropogenic disturbances. In this study, we used five genetically
   distinct sub-populations of Australian barramundi (Lates calcarifer) to
   examine the extent of intraspecific variability in hypoxia tolerance.
   Fish were maintained at two temperatures (26 or 36 degrees C),
   representing the seasonal thermal range for this species across its
   tropical distribution in Australia. All fish maintained a constant
   oxygen consumption rate (M-O2) as air saturation of the water decreased
   from 100\% down to a critical oxygen saturation ({[}O-2](crit)) of 15.44
   +/- 3.20 and 21.07 +/- 3.92\% (means +/- SD) at 26 and 36 degrees C,
   respectively. Mean {[}O-2](crit), used as a performance measure of
   hypoxia tolerance, did not differ between sub-populations. No
   differences were found for resting M-O2 between sub-populations at 26
   degrees C, but modest differences were detected between two
   sub-populations at 36 degrees C (3.36 +/- 0.62 and 2.83 +/- 0.27 mg O-2
   kg(-1) min(-1) for Gladstone and Broome sub-populations, respectively).
   Resting M-O2 was lower for sub-populations at 26 degrees C (1.46 +/-
   0.26 mg O-2 kg(-1) min(-1)) than at 36 degrees C (3.10 +/- 0.43 mg O-2
   kg(-1) min(-1)), with a temperature coefficient (Q(10)) of 2.12 +/-
   0.30. We conclude that both hypoxia tolerance and resting M-O2 are
   conserved across the distribution of barramundi in Australia, which
   reflects the capacity of this species to cope in environments with large
   fluctuations in both temperature and dissolved oxygen.},

Abstract = {The Mediterranean region is both a global biodiversity hot spot and one
   of the biomes most strongly affected by human activities. Ecologists and
   land managers are increasingly required to advise on threats to
   biodiversity under foreseeable climate change. We used expert surveys to
   evaluate current understanding and uncertainties regarding climate
   change impacts on biodiversity in terrestrial, inland freshwater, and
   marine ecosystems of Israel. Finally, we propose a response strategy
   toward minimizing these changes. The surveys and the published
   literature indicated that the main climate change impacts in Israel
   include ongoing deterioration of freshwater habitats, decline of
   shrubland and woodland areas, and increased frequency and severity of
   forest fires. For the Mediterranean Sea, the surveys predict further
   introduction and establishment of invasive species from the Red Sea,
   accelerated erosion of coastal rocky habitat, and collapse of coastal
   rocky platforms. In the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea, corals may be resilient
   to foreseen climate change due to their high tolerance for rising water
   temperatures. Despite these predictions, science-based knowledge
   regarding the contribution of management toward minimizing climate
   change impacts on biodiversity is still lacking. Habitat loss,
   degradation, and fragmentation are presently the primary and immediate
   threats to natural ecosystems in Israel. Protection of natural
   ecosystems, including local refugia, must be intensified to maintain
   existing biodiversity under pressure from mounting urban development and
   climate change. This protection policy should include ecological
   corridors to minimize the consequences of fragmentation of existing
   natural habitats for species survival. A longer-term strategy should
   mandate connectivity across environmental and climatic gradients to
   maintain natural resilience by allowing reorganization of natural
   ecosystems facing climate change.},

Title = {THE MARINE CARBON SYSTEM AND OCEAN ACIDIFICATION DURING PHANEROZOIC TIME},

Abstract = {The global CO2-carbonic acid-carbonate system of seawater, although
   certainly a well-researched topic of interest in the past, has risen to
   the fore in recent years because of the environmental issue of ocean
   acidification (often simply termed OA). Despite much previous research,
   there remain pressing questions about how this most important chemical
   system of seawater operated at the various time scales of the deep time
   of the Phanerozoic Eon (the past 545 Ma of Earth's history),
   interglacial-glacial time, and the Anthropocene (the time of strong
   human influence on the behaviour of the system) into the future of the
   planet. One difficulty in any analysis is that the behaviour of the
   marine carbon system is not only controlled by internal processes in the
   ocean, but it is intimately linked to the domains of the atmosphere,
   continental landscape, and marine carbonate sediments.
   For the deep-time behaviour of the system, there exists a strong
   coupling between the states of various material reservoirs resulting in
   an homeostatic and self-regulating system. As a working hypothesis, the
   coupling produces two dominant chemostatic modes: (Mode I), a state of
   elevated atmospheric CO2, warm climate, and depressed seawater Mg/Ca and
   SO4/Ca mol ratios, pH (extended geologic periods of ocean
   acidification), and carbonate saturation states (Omega), and elevated Sr
   concentrations, with calcite and dolomite as dominant minerals found in
   marine carbonate sediments (Hothouses, the calcite-dolomite seas), and
   (Mode II), a state of depressed atmospheric CO2, cool climate, and
   elevated seawater Mg/Ca and SO4/Ca ratios, pH, and carbonate saturation
   states, and low Sr concentrations, with aragonite and high magnesian
   calcites as dominant minerals found in marine carbonate sediments
   (Icehouses, the aragonite seas).
   Investigation of the impacts of deglaciation and anthropogenic inputs on
   the CO2-H2O-CaCO3 system in global coastal ocean waters from the Last
   Glacial Maximum (LGM: the last great continental glaciation of the
   Pleistocene Epoch, 18,000 year BP) to the year 2100 shows that with
   rising sea level, atmospheric CO2, and temperature, the carbonate system
   of coastal ocean water changed and will continue to change
   significantly. We find that 6,000 Gt of C were emitted as CO2 to the
   atmosphere from the growing coastal ocean from the Last Glacial Maximum
   to late preindustrial time because of net heterotrophy (state of gross
   respiration exceeding gross photosynthesis) and net calcification
   processes. Shallow-water carbonate accumulation alone from the Last
   Glacial Maximum to late preindustrial time could account for similar to
   24 ppmv of the similar to 100 ppmv rise in atmospheric CO2, lending some
   support to the ``coral reef hypothesis''. In addition, the global
   coastal ocean is now, or soon will be, a sink of atmospheric CO2, rather
   than a source. The pH(T) (pH values on the total proton scale) of global
   coastal seawater has decreased from similar to 8.35 to similar to 8.18
   and the CO32- ion concentration declined by similar to 19\% from the
   Last Glacial Maximum to late preindustrial time. In comparison, the
   decrease in coastal water pH(T) from the year 1900 to 2000 was similar
   to 8.18 to similar to 8.08 and is projected to decrease further from
   about similar to 8.08 to similar to 7.85 between 2000 and 2100. During
   these 200 years, the CO32- ion concentration will fall by similar to
   45\%. This decadal rate of decline of the CO32- ion concentration in the
   Anthropocene is 214 times the average rate of decline for the entire
   Holocene!
   In terms of the modern problem of ocean acidification and its effects,
   the ``other CO2 problem{''}, we emphasise that most experimental work on
   a variety of calcifying organisms has shown that under increased
   atmospheric CO2 levels (which attempt to mimic those of the future), and
   hence decreased seawater CO32- ion concentration and carbonate
   saturation state, most calcifying organisms will not calcify as rapidly
   as they do under present-day CO2 levels. In addition, we conclude that
   dissolution of the highly reactive carbonate phases, particularly the
   biogenic and cementing magnesian calcite phases, on reefs will not be
   sufficient to alter significantly future changes in seawater pH and lead
   to a buffering of the CO2-carbonic acid system in waters bathing reefs
   and other carbonate ecosystems on timescales of decades to centuries.
   Because of decreased calcification rates and increased dissolution rates
   in a future higher CO2, warmer world with seas of lower pH and carbonate
   saturation state, the rate of accretion of carbonate structures is
   likely to slow and dissolution may even exceed calcification. The
   potential of increasing nutrient and organic carbon inputs from land,
   occurrences of mass bleaching events, and increasing intensity (and
   perhaps frequency of hurricanes and cyclones as a result of sea surface
   warming) will only complicate matters more. This composite of stresses
   will have severe consequences for the ecosystem services that reefs
   perform, including acting as a fishery, a barrier to storm surges, a
   source of carbonate sediment to maintain beaches, and an environment of
   aesthetic appeal to tourist and local populations. It seems obvious that
   increasing rates of dissolution and bioerosion owing to ocean
   acidification will result in a progressively increasing calcium
   carbonate (CaCO3) deficit in the CaCO3 budget for many coral reef
   environments. The major questions that require answers are: will this
   deficit occur and when and to what extent will the destructive processes
   exceed the constructive processes?},

Abstract = {A time series of the O-17 excess ((17)Delta) was measured in the Gulf of
   Elat (Aqaba) between May 2007 and August 2009. (17)Delta is unaffected
   by respiration; thus it is a unique, conservative tracer that preserves
   the signature acquired in the photic zone, the source region for
   deep-water formation. In this study we used (17)Delta to assess the
   ratio of photosynthetic O-2 to atmospheric O-2 in deep water. We
   observed an increase of (17)Delta by 20 per meg in the water residing
   below 300 m over a period of 3 months, followed by a decrease of 60 per
   meg over the next 7 months. These changes indicated penetration of
   photosynthetic O-2, followed by penetration of atmospheric O-2 into the
   deep water. To test whether vertical mixing could explain the observed
   variations in (17)Delta, we compared our results with simulated values
   obtained from a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model, which was extended
   to include dissolved O-2 isotopes. Although successfully reproducing the
   observed temperatures, salinities, and dissolved O-2 concentrations in
   the gulf, the model could not reproduce the observed variations in
   (17)Delta in the deep water. This discrepancy shows that horizontal
   mixing processes have an important role in the interaction between deep
   and surface water in the gulf. We suggest that for the most part, these
   processes occur along the coastal boundaries of the gulf.},

Title = {Carbon and Oxygen Isotope Records from Tridacna derasa Shells: Toward
   Establishing a Reliable Proxy for Sea Surface Environments},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 21},
Abstract = {We report the carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotope
   records of three modern Tridacna derasa shells from Ishigaki-jima,
   southwestern Japan. The high-resolution delta C-13 profiles of samples
   from the inner shell layer on cross-sections fall within similar narrow
   ranges and display no regular variations or trends, such as an
   ontogenetic trend or abrupt short-term drops likely to be related to
   reproductive activity. This suggests that the calcification site of this
   species is not likely affected by photosynthetic CO2 uptake or CO2
   incorporation during respiration. The delta O-18 profiles show distinct
   seasonal cycles. The intraspecific variability in the delta O-18 values
   is small in parts of the shell precipitated in the adult stage, but is
   not negligible in the juvenile and senescent stages. The differences in
   the monthly and seasonally resolved delta O-18 values among shells are
   less than 0.51 parts per thousand and 0.76 parts per thousand,
   respectively. The shell delta O-18 values are nearly identical or close
   to the delta O-18 values for aragonite precipitated in oxygen isotope
   equilibrium with ambient seawater (delta O-18(EA)). The largest
   differences between the shell delta O-18 and delta O-18(EA) values
   calculated from the monthly and seasonally resolved data correspond to
   an overestimate of the seawater temperature by as much as 1.7 degrees C
   and 2.3 degrees C, respectively. However, these differences are smaller
   in the adult stage (<0.25\%) than in the other stages. This small
   difference allows an accurate reconstruction of the seawater temperature
   with an error of <1.1 degrees C. Consequently, we recommend that
   multiple shell records be obtained because of the non-negligible
   intraspecific variations in their delta O-18 values. Growth banding,
   composed of alternating narrow white bands and wide light-grey bands, is
   discernible on cross-sections of the inner shell layer. The delta
   O-18(shell) data indicate that they were formed in winter and the other
   seasons, respectively.},

   gastropod adjusts or succumbs to ocean acidification and warming},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {715},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Accelerating CO2 emissions have driven physico-chemical changes in the
   world's oceans, such as ocean acidification and warming. How marine
   organisms adjust or succumb to such environmental changes may be
   determined by their ability to balance energy intake against expenditure
   (i.e. energy budget) as energy supports physiological functions,
   including those with adaptive value. Here, we examined whether energy
   budget is a driver of physiological adaptability of marine calci hers to
   the near-future ocean acidification and warming; i.e. how physiological
   energetics (respiration rate, feeding rate, energy assimilation and
   energy budget) relates to adjustments in shell growth and shell
   properties of a calcifying gastropod (Austrocochlea concamerata). We
   found that ocean warming boosted the energy budget of gastropods due to
   increased feeding rate, resulting in faster shell growth and greater
   shell strength (i.e. more mechanically resilient). When combined with
   ocean acidification, however, the gastropods had a substantial decrease
   in energy budget due to reduced feeding rate and energy assimilation,
   leading to the reduction in shell growth and shell strength. By linking
   energy budget to the adjustability of shell building, we revealed that
   energy availability can be critical to determine the physiological
   adaptability of marine calcifiers to the changing oceanic climate. (C)

Abstract = {Ocean acidification and eutrophication are two important environmental
   stressors. They inevitably impact marine macroalgae, and hence the
   coastal ecosystem of China. Saccharina japonica, as the main culture
   species in China, is suffering the harmful golden tide caused by
   Sargassum horneri. However, it remains unclear whether the detrimental
   effects of S. horneri on S. japonica cultivation become more severe in
   future acidified and eutrophic scenario. In this study, we respectively
   investigated the effects of pCO(2) (400 mu atm and 1000 mu atm) and
   nutrients (non-enriched and enriched seawater) on the growth,
   photosynthesis, respiration, chlorophyll contents, and tissue nitrogen
   of S. japonica and S. horneri. Results indicated that enrichment of
   nutrients contributed S. horneri to utilize HCO3-. The carbon
   acquisition pathway shifted from HCO3- to CO2 in S. japonica, while S.
   horneri remained using HCO3- regulated by nutrient enrichment. S.
   horneri exhibited better photosynthetic traits than S. japonica, with a
   higher level of net photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll contents at
   elevated pCO(2) and enriched nutrients. Tissue nitrogen also accumulated
   richly in the thalli of S. horneri under higher pCO(2) and nutrients.
   Significant enhancement in growth was only detected in S. horneri under
   synergistic stress. Together, S. horneri showed competitive dominance in
   current study. These findings suggest that increasing risk of golden
   tide in acidified and eutrophic ocean can most likely result in great
   damage to S. japonica cultivation.},

   September 2, 2009; doi: 10.1152/ajpregu.00324.2009.-Benthic marine
   organisms such as mollusks are often exposed to periodic oxygen
   deficiency (due to the tidal exposure and/or seasonal expansion of the
   oxygen-deficient dead zones) and pollution by metals {[}e. g., cadmium,
   (Cd)]. These stressors can strongly affect mollusks' survival; however,
   physiological mechanisms of their combined effects are not fully
   understood. We studied the effects of Cd exposure on metabolic responses
   to prolonged anoxia and subsequent recovery in anoxia-tolerant
   intertidal mollusks Crassostrea virginica (eastern oysters). Anoxia led
   to an onset of anaerobiosis indicated by accumulation of L-alanine,
   acetate, and succinate. Prolonged anoxia (for 6 days) caused a decline
   in the maximum activity of electron transport chain and ADP-stimulated
   (state 3) oxygen uptake by mitochondria (MO2), but no change in the
   resting (state 4) MO2 of oyster mitochondria, along with a slight but
   significant reduction of mitochondrial respiratory control ratio. During
   reoxygenation, there was a significant overshoot of mitochondrial MO2
   (by up to 70\% above the normoxic steady-state values) in control
   oysters. Mild mitochondrial uncoupling during prolonged shutdown in
   anoxic tissues and a subsequent strong stimulation of mitochondrial flux
   during recovery may help to rapidly restore redox status and protect
   against elevated reactive oxygen species formation in oysters. Exposure
   to Cd inhibits anaerobic metabolism, abolishes reoxygenation-induced
   stimulation of mitochondrial MO2, and leads to oxidative stress
   (indicated by accumulation of DNA lesions) and a loss of mitochondrial
   capacity during postanoxic recovery. This may result in increased
   sensitivity to intermittent hypoxia and anoxia in Cd-exposed mollusks
   and will have implications for their survival in polluted estuaries and
   coastal zones.},

Title = {Ocean acidification reverses the positive effects of seawater pH
   fluctuations on growth and photosynthesis of the habitat-forming kelp,
   Ecklonia radiata},

Abstract = {Ocean acidification (OA) is the reduction in seawater pH due to the
   absorption of human-released CO2 by the world's oceans. The average
   surface oceanic pH is predicted to decline by 0.4 units by 2100.
   However, kelp metabolically modifies seawater pH via photosynthesis and
   respiration in some temperate coastal systems, resulting in daily pH
   fluctuations of up to +/- 0.45 units. It is unknown how these
   fluctuations in pH influence the growth and physiology of the kelp, or
   how this might change with OA. In laboratory experiments that mimicked
   the most extreme pH fluctuations measured within beds of the
   canopy-forming kelp Ecklonia radiata in Tasmania, the growth and
   photosynthetic rates of juvenile E. radiata were greater under
   fluctuating pH (8.4 in the day, 7.8 at night) than in static pH
   treatments (8.4, 8.1, 7.8). However, pH fluctuations had no effect on
   growth rates and a negative effect on photosynthesis when the mean pH of
   each treatment was reduced by 0.3 units. Currently, pH fluctuations have
   a positive effect on E. radiata but this effect could be reversed in the
   future under OA, which is likely to impact the future ecological
   dynamics and productivity of habitats dominated by E. radiata.},

Abstract = {The impetus for this study was the mass bleaching event of giant clams
   in 1997-1998 at several reefs in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR,
   Australia). From September until December 1999, the study investigated
   the effects of high light intensities and increased temperature
   accompanied by a nutrient limitation on the metabolism of Tridacna
   gigas, to test, if these environmental changes can induce bleaching. In
   a 50-day trial similar conditions of the mass bleaching event were
   imitated stressing clams, collected from Orpheus Island and Nelly Bay,
   by a two- to threefold light intensity and an increased temperature of
   4-6 degreesC. The objectives of the experiments were to determine
   whether high light intensities can induce changes in chlorophyll content
   or alter zooxanthella cell sizes and populations in the tissue. After 50
   days of exposure to high light intensity the mantle tissue of stressed
   clams exhibited a decreased number of zooxanthellae per unit area from
   19.8 +/- 0.8 (x 10(7).cm(-2)) to 0.2 +/- 0.2 (x 10(7.)cm(-2)) (Mean +/-
   CL). Additionally, the average cell size of zooxanthellae were downsized
   from 7.4 +/- 0.1 mum to 5.3 +/- 0.1 mum (mean CL). Subsequently, the
   chlorophyll content of both, chl a and chl c, declined as well, chl a
   from 192 +/- 4 to 0.1 +/- 0.1 mug.ml(-1) and chl c(1) from 145 +/- 6 to
   0 mug.ml(-1) (mean CL). This study shows that increased light intensity
   and temperature are the main causes for bleaching in giant clams. Thus,
   the study confirmed the four major aspects involved in bleaching: (1)
   loss of symbiotic algae, (2) decrease of chl a/c(1) in the remaining
   symbiotic algae, (3) retention of small zooxanthellae in the tissue and
   (4) release of ammonium (NH4+) into the water column while nutrient
   uptake of ammonium was largely blocked. (C) 2002

Title = {Modeling the signal transfer of seawater delta O-18 to the delta O-18 of
   atmospheric oxygen using a diagnostic box model for the terrestrial and
   marine biosphere},

Abstract = {We make use of a simple diagnostic box model to determine the
   sensitivities of the influencing parameters for the isotopic signal
   transfer of seawater oxygen to atmospheric oxygen. We calculate the
   delta(18)O of atmospheric oxygen from prescribed oxygen fluxes of the
   living and dead biomes on land and in the ocean, respectively. The model
   is driven by an assumed (experiment 1) or measured (experiments 2 and 3)
   temporal seawater delta(18)O signal and a land biomass estimation. In
   experiment 1, we calculated the required changes of several model
   parameters in order to study fast variations of delta(18)O of
   atmospheric oxygen as seen in the Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) ice
   at depths assigned to the Eemian time period. Our calculations support
   evidence of stratigraphic problems at these depths in the GRIP ice core.
   In experiment 2, we adjusted the model output, which was driven by the
   benthic seawater delta(18)O record from V19-30, to the measured
   Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 delta(18)O record of atmospheric oxygen
   for the last 110,000 years. by varying the model parameter. Single and
   multiparameter marchings were performed. The results for
   single-parameter runs exceed the uncertainty ranges for most of the
   parameters, while multiparameter variations are well within these
   ranges. The model calculations are most sensitive to the land
   respiration factor. Our results support the findings of Van de Water et
   al. {[}1994] that the fractionations associated with biomes activities
   were most probably lower during cold periods, which could point to a
   combination of fractionations with different temperature dependencies.
   The model results indicate periods of higher marine biological activity
   during the ice age than today. Temporal variations of the model
   parameters show a double peak around 10000 and 8000 years ago, which
   could be associated with meltwater pulses, as shown in experiment 3.
   However, they are hardly the well-known Fairbanks {[}Fairbanks er al.,
   1992] pulses since these occur 3000 to 4000 years earlier.},

Abstract = {Effects of acclimation to projected near-future ocean acidification (OA)
   conditions on physiology, reproduction and development were investigated
   in the tropical sea urchin Echinometra mathaei. Following 6 weeks in
   control or one of the three elevated pCO(2) (pH(NIST) 7.5-8.1; pCO(2)
   similar to 485-1,770 mu atm) conditions, adult urchins exhibited a
   slight decline of growth in low pH treatments and moderately reduced
   respiration at intermediate levels. At 7 weeks, gametes from adults were
   used to produce larvae that were reared in their respective parental
   treatments. To assess whether larvae from acclimated parents are more
   resilient to elevated pCO(2) than those not acclimated, larvae from
   control animals were also reared in the elevated pCO(2) treatments.
   There was no difference in female `spawnability' and oocyte size between
   treatments, but male spawning ability was reduced in increased pCO(2)
   conditions. In elevated pCO(2) treatments, the percentage of normal
   larvae and larval size decreased in the progeny of control- and elevated
   pCO(2)-acclimated parents, and arm asymmetry increased. Thus,
   acclimation of the parents did not make the progeny more resilient or
   sensitive to OA effects. Negative effects of increased pCO(2) on
   reproduction and development may impact on recruitment and population
   maintenance of this species.},

Title = {Climate-dependent CO2 emissions from lakes},
Journal = {GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {24},
Month = {MAY 8},
Abstract = {Inland waters, just as the world's oceans, play an important role in the
   global carbon cycle. While lakes and reservoirs typically emit CO2, they
   also bury carbon in their sediment. The net CO2 emission is largely the
   result of the decomposition or preservation of terrestrially supplied
   carbon. What regulates the balance between CO2 emission and carbon
   burial is not known, but climate change and temperature have been
   hypothesized to influence both processes. We analyzed patterns in carbon
   dioxide partial pressure (pCO(2)) in 83 shallow lakes over a large
   climatic gradient in South America and found a strong, positive
   correlation with temperature. The higher pCO(2) in warmer lakes may be
   caused by a higher, temperature-dependent mineralization of organic
   carbon. This pattern suggests that cool lakes may start to emit more CO2
   when they warm up because of climate change.},

Year = {2008},
Volume = {55},

Pages = {247-258},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Temporal variations of oxygen consumption, sensitivity to metal spiking,
   and microbial diversity were investigated during a one-year survey at
   the sediment-water interface in the tropical lagoon of New Caledonia.
   Sediment oxygen consumption (SOC) exhibited strong variations with time
   with maximum rates during February (Austral summer) and minimum values
   during July (cold period). SOC was strongly positively correlated with
   temperature, with an apparent activation energy (E-a) of 41 kJ mol(-1),
   corresponding to an apparent Q(10)(20-30 degrees C) of 1.75. Strong
   short-term variations of SOC were also observed with ratios between two
   consecutive samplings reaching up to twofold of magnitude within one
   week, whereas the maximum/minimum ratio over the whole year was equal to
   2.73. In most cases, metal spiking led to a strong decrease of SOC;
   however, in a third of sampling dates, spiking did not significantly
   decrease activity. These periods of apparent metal tolerance were not
   characterized by a particular bacterial community structure. Bacterial
   community structure estimated from terminal restriction fragment length
   polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis exhibited strong variations over the
   one-year survey, and no seasonality was observed for bacterial richness.
   However, on average, the Whittaker similarity index between two
   consecutive T-RFLP profiles was above 60\% suggesting a relative
   stability of the bacterial community structure on the short timescale
   with prominent T-RFs representing on average more than 67\% of relative
   abundance occurring over most of the year, whereas other T-RFs only
   occurred during some periods.},

Title = {The role of the Leeuwin Current and mixed layer depth on the autumn

Journal = {CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {32},
Pages = {22-35},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {On a seasonal cycle, the phytoplankton biomass off the North West Cape
   region of Australia surrounding Ningaloo Reef increased during the
   austral autumn and peaked in winter. In this study, historical field
   data sets, satellite-derived ocean color observations and output from a
   data-assimilating numerical ocean model are used to investigate physical
   mechanisms that influence the seasonal variability in phytoplankton
   biomass off this coast. The mixed layer depth (MLD) off Ningaloo
   deepened to similar to 100 m in autumn, partly due to the acceleration
   of the Leeuwin Current, which induced an increase in nutrient
   concentrations and is the key mechanism responsible for the seasonal
   enhancement in chlorophyll a concentrations observed in the waters off
   Ningaloo Reef. By comparing the MLDs and the critical depth it is
   suggested that while average irradiance throughout the MLD was low, this
   had less impact on net growth than grazing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Fast-starting after a breath: air-breathing motions are kinematically
   similar to escape responses in the catfish Hoplosternum littorale},
Journal = {BIOLOGY OPEN},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {79-85},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Fast-starts are brief accelerations commonly observed in fish within the
   context of predator-prey interactions. In typical C-start escape
   responses, fish react to a threatening stimulus by bending their body
   into a C-shape during the first muscle contraction (i.e. stage 1) which
   provides a sudden acceleration away from the stimulus. Recently, similar
   C-starts have been recorded in fish aiming at a prey. Little is known
   about C-starts outside the context of predator-prey interactions, though
   recent work has shown that escape response can also be induced by high
   temperature. Here, we test the hypothesis that air-breathing fish may
   use C-starts in the context of gulping air at the surface. Hoplosternum
   littorale is an air-breathing freshwater catfish found in South America.
   Field video observations reveal that their air-breathing behaviour
   consists of airgulping at the surface, followed by a fast turn which
   re-directs the fish towards the bottom. Using high-speed video in the
   laboratory, we compared the kinematics of the turn immediately following
   airgulping performed by H. littorale in normoxia with those of
   mechanically-triggered C-start escape responses and with routine (i.e.
   spontaneous) turns. Our results show that air-breathing events overlap
   considerably with escape responses with a large stage 1 angle in terms
   of turning rates, distance covered and the relationship between these
   rates. Therefore, these two behaviours can be considered kinematically
   comparable, suggesting that air-breathing in this species is followed by
   escape-like C-start motions, presumably to minimise time at the surface
   and exposure to avian predators. These findings show that C-starts can
   occur in a variety of contexts in which fish may need to get away from
   areas of potential danger.},

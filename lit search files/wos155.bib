Abstract = {{Five species of lichens, the majority members of a soil-crust community
   (Cladonia convoluta, Diploschistes muscorum, Fulgensia fulgens, Lecanora
   muralis, Squamarina lentigera) showed seasonal changes of temperature
   sensitivity of their dark respiration (DR) to such an extent that
   several substantially met the definition of full acclimation, i.e. near
   identical DR under different nocturnal temperature conditions during the
   course of the year. C. convoluta, for example, had maximal DR at 5
   degreesC of - 0.42, - 1.11 and - 0.09 nmol CO2 g(-1) s(-1) in autumn,
   winter, and summer, respectively, a tenfold range. However, at the mean
   night temperatures for the same three seasons, 9.7 degreesC, 4.2
   degreesC and 13.6 degreesC, maximal DR were almost identical at - 1.11,
   - 0.93, and - 1.45 nmol CO2 g(-1) s(-1). The information was extracted
   from measurements using automatic cuvettes that continuously recorded a
   sample lichen's gas exchange every 30 min under near-natural conditions.
   The longest period ( for L. muralis) covered 15 months and 22,000 data
   sets whilst, for the other species studied, data blocks were available
   throughout the calendar year. The acclimation of DR means that maximal
   net carbon fixation rates remain substantially similar throughout the
   year and are not depressed by increased carbon loss by respiration in
   warmer seasons. This is especially important for lichens because of
   their normally high rate of DR compared to net photosynthesis. We
   suggest that lichens, especially soil-crust species, could be a suitable
   model for fungi generally, a group of organisms for which little is
   known about temperature acclimation because of the great difficulty in
   separating the organism from its growth medium. Fungi, whether
   saprophytic, symbiotic or parasitic, including soil lichens, are
   important components of soil ecosystems and contribute much of the
   respired CO2 from these systems. Temperature acclimation by fungi would
   mean that expected increases in carbon losses caused by global climate
   warming from soil ecosystems might not be as extensive as first thought.
   This would ameliorate this positive feedback loop present in some
   climate models and might substantially lower the predicted warming.}},

Abstract = {{Data on the respiratory activity of 12 species of Antarctic lichens are
   presented. It is found that the respiration of foliose lichens is more
   intensive than the respiration of fruticose lichens. The O-2 uptake rate
   correlates positively with the nitrogen content in the biomass of thalli
   and depends on temperature. The thalli O-2 uptake rate increased 2.2-2.4
   times with a temperature increase from 5 to 15 degrees C. The reaction
   of respiration upon a further rise in temperature is species-specific.
   The decrease in the temperature coefficient of respiration (Q(10)) with
   a temperature increase to 35 degrees C is most pronounced in the endemic
   species Usnea aurantiaco-atra, which is well-adapted to Antarctic
   conditions. The calculations show that, in summer, lichens are able to
   lose an amount of substrate equivalent to 0.8-1.4\% of the thallus dry
   biomass in respiration daily. The total respiration cost of the lichen
   maintenance under snow during the winter can reach of 30-35\% from their
   biomass. These results extend our knowledge on Antarctic lichens, and
   prediction their response to climatic change.}},

Abstract = {{Respiration is a crucial process that provides all living organisms with

   We investigated the effects of short-term temperature changes on the

   lichen species collected from their natural habitats in Antarctica.
   Lichen respiration was sensitive to short-term temperature increases
   over a range of 5-35 degrees C. The total O(2)uptake rate was increased
   by fourfold, and the mean respiratory coefficient (Q(10)) decreased from
   2.5 to 1.3 as the temperature increased. An increase in temperature from
   5 to 15 degrees C had a positive effect on cytochrome respiration
   coupled with energy production. Temperatures above 15 degrees C
   stimulated the activation of the alternative (energy-dissipating)
   respiratory pathway. Hyperthermia led to increased O(2)consumption that

Abstract = {{The Antarctic Peninsula, a tundra biome dominated by lichens and
   bryophytes, is an ecozone undergoing rapid temperature shifts. Such
   changes may demand a high physiological plasticity of the local lichen
   species to maintain their role as key drivers in this pristine habitat.
   This study examines the response of net photosynthesis and respiration
   to increasing temperatures for three Antarctic lichen species with
   different ecological response amplitudes. We hypothesize that negative
   effects caused by increased temperatures can be mitigated by thermal
   acclimation of respiration and/or photosynthesis. The fully controlled
   growth chamber experiment simulated intermediate and extreme temperature
   increases over the time course of 6 weeks. Results showed that, in
   contrast to our hypothesis, none of the species was able to
   down-regulate temperature-driven respiratory losses through thermal
   acclimation of respiration. Instead, severe effects on photobiont
   vitality demonstrated that temperatures around 15 degrees C mark the
   upper limit for the two species restricted to the Antarctic, and when
   mycobiont demands exceeded the photobiont capacity they could not
   survive within the lichen thallus. In contrast, the widespread lichen
   species was able to recover its homoeostasis by rapidly increasing net
   photosynthesis. We conclude that to understand the complete lichen
   response, acclimation processes of both symbionts, the photo- and the
   mycobiont, have to be evaluated separately. As a result, we postulate
   that any acclimation processes in lichen are species-specific. This,
   together with the high degree of response variability and sensitivity to
   temperature in different species that co-occur spatially close,
   complicates any predictions regarding future community composition in
   the Antarctic. Nevertheless, our results suggest that species with a
   broad ecological amplitude may be favoured with on-going changes in
   temperature.}},

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{119-125}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. Respiration in eight lichen species was related to thallus hydration
   status, external temperature and to total nitrogen, chitin and
   ergosterol concentrations. Chitin is a nitrogenous and major compound of
   the fungal cell wall, and ergosterol is a sterol of the plasma membrane
   in fungi and sometimes in algae.
   2. Hydration of previously dry thalli resulted in an initially high rate
   of respiration. Both the amplitude of this resaturation respiration and
   the time required to reach steady state varied among species. Generally,
   peak rates were one to three times higher than steady-state rates, which
   were reached 3-7 h after hydration,
   3. Increases in external temperature also resulted in transient bursts
   in respiration. Again, both the amplitude of the burst and the time
   required to reach steady state varied among species. Also depending on
   species, a temperature increase from 5 to 15 degrees C resulted in two-
   to fivefold increases in steady-state respiration.
   4. Steady-state respiration, at optimal thallus hydration and a given
   temperature, varied three- to sixfold among the species, when related to
   thallus dry mass. This difference correlated best (r(2) = 0.89) with
   their ergosterol concentration, where a doubling in ergosterol resulted
   in more than a doubling in respiration. Respiration correlated less well
   to total nitrogen or chitin.
   5. The chitin to ergosterol ratio varied more than one order of
   magnitude between the species, where species with high nitrogen
   concentrations had the highest ratio. This implies that species with
   access to ample amounts of nitrogen can make more fungal cell walls in
   relation to plasma membrane surface area.}},

Abstract = {{Aiming to investigate whether a carbon-to-nitrogen equilibrium model

   respiration (R), concentrations of nitrogen (N), chlorophyll (Chl),
   chitin and ergosterol were investigated in 75 different lichen
   associations collected in Antarctica, Arctic Canada, boreal Sweden, and
   temperate/subtropical forests of Tenerife, South Africa and Japan. The
   lichens had various morphologies and represented seven photobiont and 41
   mycobiont genera. Chl a, chitin and ergosterol were used as indirect
   markers of photobiont activity, fungal biomass and fungal respiration,
   respectively. The lichens were divided into three groups according to
   photobiont: (1) species with green algae, (2) species with
   cyanobacteria, and (3) tripartite species with green algal photobionts
   and cyanobacteria in cephalodia. Across species, thallus N concentration
   ranged from 1 to 50 mg g(-1) dry wt., NP varied 50-fold, and R 10-fold.
   In average, green algal lichens had the lowest, cyanobacterial Nostoc
   lichens the highest and tripartite lichens intermediate N
   concentrations. All three markers increased with thallus N
   concentration, and lichens with the highest Chl a and N concentrations
   had the highest rates of both P and R. Chl a alone accounted for ca.
   30\% of variation in NP and R across species. On average, the
   photosynthetic efficiency quotient {[}K-F=(NPmax+R)/R)] ranged from 2.4
   to 8.6, being higher in fruticose green algal lichens than in foliose
   Nostoc lichens. The former group invested more N in Chl a and this trait
   increased NPmax while decreasing R. In general terms, the investigated
   lichens invested N resources such that their maximal C input capacity
   matched their respiratory C demand around a similar (positive)
   equilibrium across species. However, it is not clear how this apparent
   optimisation of resource use is regulated in these symbiotic organisms.}},

Abstract = {{Dark respiration (DR) of lichens is reported to be higher in species

   the occurrence of the latter, the effect of diurnal net photosynthesis
   (NP) on subsequent nocturnal DR, under natural temperate climate
   conditions in the chlorolichens Lecanora muralis and Cladonia convoluta
   and the cyanolichen Collema cristatum. Data sets totalling 15 months,
   106 and 113 days, respectively, were obtained from automatic cuvettes
   that continually measured CO2 exchange and ambient conditions at 30 min
   intervals. For each 24 h period (sunrise to following sunrise), several
   measures of NP and DR were extracted, including maximal and mean rates
   and daily sums. No statistically significant correlations between the
   various measures of DR and preceding NP were found for L. muralis, only
   one weak correlation for Co. cristatum (the means of DR and NP) and
   three for Cl. convoluta (sums and means of DR and NP). It is proposed
   that even these significant correlations are actually a result of
   embedded codependencies between NP, DR and thallus water content.
   Overall it is concluded that no substrate-driven dependency of DR on
   preceding NP under natural conditions could be recognised. The periods

   as the wide range of combinations of conditions would certainly
   contribute to this lack of relationship.}},

Abstract = {{While it has been widely proven that many lichens are extremely
   freeze-tolerant in the dry state, little is known about how moist
   lichens respond to freezing under oxic and anoxic conditions. In
   circumpolar areas where lichens are an important component of boreal and
   Arctic ecosystems, winter climate is changing, leading to increased
   frequency of winter thaw and ground-icing events. It is imperative to
   elucidate in further detail how northern vegetation responds to being
   encapsulated in ice. A winter icing simulation experiment was therefore
   undertaken, encapsulating two reindeer lichens (Cladonia stellaris and
   Cladonia rangiferina) and two epiphytic lichens (Parmeliopsis ambigua
   and Melanohalea olivacea) in ice at temperatures just below freezing for
   a maximum period of 98 d. Photosynthetic and chlorophyll fluorescence
   rates decreased strongly, clearly suggesting that the algal partner of
   the lichens was dying. Low but detectable respiration rates indicate
   that the fungal partner maintained some physiological activity. Ethanol
   accumulated in the lichens during ice encapsulation as a result of
   anaerobic respiration. The algae probably were dying from a combination
   of depletion of carbon reserves and toxic levels of ethanol and other
   stress metabolites. This experiment shows that boreal and Arctic-alpine
   lichens are sensitive to a warmer and more fluctuating winter climate.
   Increasing frequency of winter icing events may therefore have extensive
   and hitherto unknown effects on lichen-dominated ecosystems, their
   herbivores and the indigenous peoples whose livelihoods largely depend

Abstract = {{Lichens are a symbiosis between a fungus and one or more photosynthetic
   microorganisms that enables the symbionts to thrive in places and
   conditions they could not compete independently. Exchanges of water and
   sugars between the symbionts are the established mechanisms that support
   lichen symbiosis. Herein, we present a new linkage between algal
   photosynthesis and fungal respiration in lichen Flavoparmelia caperata
   that extends the physiological nature of symbiotic co-dependent
   metabolisms, mutually boosting energy conversion rates in both
   symbionts. Measurements of electron transport by oximetry show that
   photosynthetic O-2 is consumed internally by fungal respiration. At low
   light intensity, very low levels of O-2 are released, while
   photosynthetic electron transport from water oxidation is normal as
   shown by intrinsic chlorophyll variable fluorescence yield (period-4
   oscillations in flash-induced Fv/Fm). The rate of algal O-2 production
   increases following consecutive series of illumination periods, at low
   and with limited saturation at high light intensities, in contrast to
   light saturation in free-living algae. We attribute this effect to arise
   from the availability of more CO2 produced by fungal respiration of
   photosynthetically generated sugars. We conclude that the lichen
   symbionts are metabolically coupled by energy conversion through
   exchange of terminal electron donors and acceptors used in both
   photosynthesis and fungal respiration. Algal sugars and O-2 are consumed
   by the fungal symbiont, while fungal delivered CO2 is consumed by the

Abstract = {{Photosynthetic activity and structural changes at subzero temperatures
   were monitored in the foliose lichen Umbilicaria aprina Nyl. from

   revealed that net photosynthesis and dark respiration occurred at
   subzero temperatures regardless of whether a lichen thallus saturated
   with liquid water was exposed to subzero temperatures, or if a dry
   thallus was re-hydrated only from snow at subzero temperatures. When
   water-saturated thalli of U. aprina were slowly cooled at subzero
   temperatures ice nucleation activity could be detected at -5.4 degrees
   C, indicating extracellular freezing of water. Using low-temperature
   scanning electron microscopy (LTSEM) it was demonstrated that
   extracellular ice formation leads to cytorrhysis in the photobiont cells
   and to cavitation in the mycobiont cells. Both processes were reversible
   if the lichen thallus was re-warmed. When dry lichen thalli were covered
   with snow at subzero temperatures a substantial re-hydration from snow
   could be observed in LTSEM micrographs and measured gravimetrically. The
   final thallus water content was strongly dependent on the temperature
   regime and gave water contents between 20\% d. wt at -21 degrees C and
   56\% d. wt at -4.5 degrees C after 16 h exposure. Carbon dioxide gas
   exchange measurements revealed that metabolic activity was initiated
   during re-hydration from snow at subzero temperatures. It is proposed
   that water uptake from snow at subzero temperatures occurs in the
   gaseous phase and depends only on the temperature-related differences in
   water potential between the cell contents and the surrounding atmosphere
   in equilibrium with snow. Photosynthetic activity and re-hydration from

   primary production in extreme environments such as Antarctica where

   increased the temperature sensitivity (Q(10) values) of soil respiration
   in biocrust-dominated areas, particularly during the wet year. The
   combination of warming and rainfall exclusion had similar effects in low
   biocrust cover areas. Our results highlight the importance of biocrusts
   as a modulator of soil respiration responses to both warming and
   rainfall exclusion, and indicate that they must be explicitly considered

Abstract = {{Photosynthetic responses to moisture, light, temperature, salinity and
   inorganic nitrogen fertilization are reported for a shore-zone lichen
   Turgidiusculum complicatulum (formerly Mastodia tesselata), a possible
   recent introduction to sub-Antarctic Marion Island.
   Optimum moisture contents for net photosynthesis were 225-346\% lash
   free, dry mass). Net CO2 exchange was dominated by a strong temperature
   dependence of respiration rate. Net photosynthetic rate responded
   sharply to increasing PPFD and saturated below 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1),
   but electron transport rate (ETR) increased up to approx. 900 mu mol
   m(-2) s(-1) PPFD suggesting that gross photosynthesis responded to light
   to this level. Nonphotochemical fluorescence quenching increased rapidly
   with PPFD up to approx. 400 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and thereafter more
   slowly. Even at high PPFD (1050 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) most PSII centres
   were open.
   Salinity did not significantly influence CO2 assimilation rate; however,
   NH4NO3 significantly depressed net photosynthesis rate at all salinities
   except 100\% seawater. ETR and dark respiration rate were increased by
   NH4NO3.
   The response of T. complicatulum to light and temperature enables high
   rates of CO2 assimilation under the island's microclimatic regime; if
   sufficiently hydrated, the lichen would exhibit near maximal
   photosynthesis rates for approx. 75\% of the photoperiod over the year.}},

Abstract = {{CO2 exchange of the epilithic, green algal lichen Lecanora muralis was
   monitored continuously for 15 months by means of an automatic cuvette in
   its natural habitat in the Botanical Garden, Wurzburg (Bavaria,
   Germany). As a first stage in the interpretation of the results,
   identically treated parallel samples were used, under controlled
   laboratory conditions, to determine the dependence of net photosynthesis
   (NP) and dark respiration (DR) on light, CO2 concentration, thallus
   hydration and temperature. Results of these measurements are
   communicated in the present, first part of a series of publications.
   The lichen showed an extremely large and extended suprasaturation
   depression of its CO2 assimilation. NP at high hydration was reduced
   almost to the compensation point. Maximal NP was only possible in a very
   small window of thallus water content (WC). Thallus water relations
   dominated the lichen's responses to the other environmental factors and
   the combination of `optimal' moisture and light conditions was a rare
   event and lasted only for short times under natural conditions.
   Light response curves showed typical saturation kinetics with
   `sun-plant' characteristics. Maximal NP, light saturation, maximal
   quantum use efficiency, and light compensation point were highly
   dependent on WC. Temperature optimum of NP was about 22 degreesC. But,
   at 2 degreesC, NP was still 60\% of maximal NP. Under optimal WC, NP
   became saturated at c 1000 ppm external CO2 and, at natural, ambient
   CO2, NP was 62\% of maximal NP with a CO2 compensation point of 16 ppm.
   Suprasaturation depression of NP was not completely removed by 5000 ppm
   external CO2, Seasonal changes in photosynthetic capacity and other
   photosynthetic parameters were extremely small. However, dark
   respiratory capacity showed a clear adaptation to low winter
   temperatures. This resulted in a higher light compensation point for CO2
   exchange in winter than in summer.
   The daily and seasonal courses of CO2 exchange of L. muralis under
   natural conditions will be reported in further communications. The field
   performance of the lichen will be interpreted and analysed by means of
   the data presented here.}},

Abstract = {{The lichen species Teloschistes lacunosus (RUPR.) SAV, and Ramalina

   differed between both species. Optimal temperatures of NP were higher in
   T. lacunosus than in R. bourgeana at optimal thallus water content at
   the various photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) levels. In the
   upper temperature range studied (20-25 degrees C), R. bourgeana proved
   to be less efficient than T. lacunosus. In both species, lower and upper
   temperature compensation points were below 0 degrees C and above 30
   degrees C, for moderate and high PPFD levels, respectively. At high
   temperatures and high thallus water content, T. lacunosus showed lower

Abstract = {{To survive in high mountain environments lichens must adapt themselves
   to alternating periods of desiccation and hydration. Respiration and
   photosynthesis of the foliaceous lichen, Xanthoria elegans, in the
   dehydrated state were below the threshold of CO2-detection by infrared
   gas analysis. Following hydration, respiration totally recovered within
   seconds and photosynthesis within minutes. In order to identify
   metabolic processes that may contribute to the quick and efficient
   reactivation of lichen physiological processes, we analysed the
   metabolite profile of lichen thalli step by step during
   hydration/dehydration cycles, using P-31- and C-13-NMR. It appeared that
   the recovery of respiration was prepared during dehydration by the
   accumulation of a reserve of gluconate 6-P (glcn-6-P) and by the
   preservation of nucleotide pools, whereas glycolytic and photosynthetic
   intermediates like glucose 6-P and ribulose 1,5-diphosphate were absent.
   The large pools of polyols present in both X. elegans photo- and
   mycobiont are likely to contribute to the protection of cell
   constituents like nucleotides, proteins, and membrane lipids, and to
   preserve the integrity of intracellular structures during desiccation.
   Our data indicate that glcn-6-P accumulated due to activation of the
   oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, in response to a need for reducing
   power (NADPH) during the dehydration-triggered down-regulation of cell
   metabolism. On the contrary, glcn-6-P was metabolised immediately after
   hydration, supplying respiration with substrates during the
   replenishment of pools of glycolytic and photosynthetic intermediates.
   Finally, the high net photosynthetic activity of wet X. elegans thalli
   at low temperature may help this alpine lichen to take advantage of
   brief hydration opportunities such as ice melting, thus favouring its
   growth in harsh high mountain climates.}},

Abstract = {{The terrestrial vegetation in Antarctica is restricted to small, very
   isolated, ice-free areas on the continent and on the islands adjacent to
   the Peninsula region. Lichens, a symbiosis between a fungus and an alga
   or cyanobacterium, form the most prominent component in the vegetation.
   They have the greatest number of species compared with other cryptogamic
   and unicellular organisms. They are able to colonize all types of solid
   substrata and have a low mineral nutrient demand. Their physiological
   vigour is derived from high freezing tolerance and the ability to be
   photosynthetically activated by water vapour uptake from snow at
   temperatures as low as c. -20 degrees C. Long-term monitoring in their
   natural habitats demonstrates that lichens are photosynthetically active
   at suboptimal temperatures. Locally, however, they can benefit from
   meltwater on insolated rocks, but only for short periods in early
   summer. Although at this time they may be exposed to substrate
   temperatures of > 20 degrees C and strong light they do not suffer from
   photostress. If, in winter, lichens are covered and kept dark by snow
   with temperatures close to 0 degrees C, lichens enter a negative carbon
   balance. This effect may be relevant to lichens under conditions of
   global or regional warming.}},

Abstract = {{We studied polar and temperate samples of the lichen Cetraria aculeata

   Samples were collected from maritime Antarctica, Svalbard, Germany and

   photobiont showed that the investigated samples fall in the polar and
   temperate clade described in Fernandez-Mendoza et al. (Mol Ecol

Abstract = {{Ecosystem respiration (ER) is the largest flux of carbon (C) from
   terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere, yet our ability to model this
   aggregate flux lags considerably behind our ability to model
   photosynthesis. Arctic ecosystems hold large stocks of potentially
   labile soil C and are dominated by plants with high root: shoot ratios.
   However, simple models of Arctic tundra ER typically use only
   aboveground drivers, such as air temperature and leaf area index. To
   investigate this apparent discrepancy, we partitioned ER into its
   component fluxes in moist acidic tussock tundra, which is among the most
   widespread of Arctic ecosystems. To partition ER, we combined
   tissue-scale measurements of leaf, wood, moss, lichen, and root
   respiration with seasonal biomass estimates. Simple respiration models
   were fit to the data for each tissue type. Our results suggest that
   belowground respiration is a large proportion of ER and that its
   contribution increases over the course of the growing season with soil
   thaw. We estimated that bulk soil heterotrophic respiration made up
   approximately 40 \%, root respiration made up 35 \%, mosses contributed
   8.5 \% and all vascular plant leaves combined made up a mere 13.5 \% of
   ER during the 2012 growing season. Our ability to model aboveground
   tissue respiration exceeded our ability to model belowground
   respiration. We hypothesize that effects of the aboveground climate on
   rhizosphere respiration, mediated by the production and delivery of
   photosynthate, may be a critical determinant of ER, as this would
   reconcile our results with simple models of ER.}},

Abstract = {{CO2 exchange of the epilithic, green algal lichen Lecanora muralis was
   monitored continuously for 15 months by means of an automatic cuvette in
   its natural habitat in the Botanical Garden, Wurzburg (Bavaria,
   Germany). Simultaneously weather data and chlorophyll fluorescence were
   recorded. The periods of metabolic activity for the lichen were
   restricted because of the low water holding capacity of its thin thallus
   and high desiccation rates. The total activity was only 35.6\% of the
   year made up of net photosynthetic CO2 uptake, 16.7\%, and respiratory
   CO2 release, 18.9\%. This was substantially less than found for
   gelatinous or foliose lichens under similar conditions. The active time
   was longest in October (57.7\%) and shortest in June (17.2\%). Lecanora
   muralis suffered from strong suprasaturation depression of net
   photosynthesis so that its carbon gain was substantially limited after
   heavy wetting. Averaged over the total year, net photosynthesis (NP) of
   the lichen was heavily depressed through suprasaturation for 38.5\% of
   that time when photosynthesis was possible. NP took place under snow and
   at subzero thallus temperatures (between -4 and -5degreesC). Water
   status was the most important factor that determined the diurnal
   patterns of NP. Diel time courses of photosynthetic and respiratory
   performance could be divided in several response types such as lichen
   dry all day, lichen moistened by dew or frost, rain during night and
   subsequent drying during the day, rain during the day with or without
   suprasaturation depression, and lichen below snow. The seasonal
   distribution of these response types was analysed. Optimal NP was only
   possible over a very small range of WC (water content) that rarely
   occurred in combination with optimal light and temperature conditions.
   Thus, maximal rates of NP were seldom attained and then lasted only for
   a short time, sometimes no longer than a few minutes. The interplay

Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{111}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{455-465}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims There is a conspicuous increase of poikilohydric
   organisms (mosses, liverworts and macrolichens) with altitude in the
   tropics. This study addresses the hypothesis that the lack of bryophytes
   in the lowlands is due to high-temperature effects on the carbon
   balance. In particular, it is tested experimentally whether temperature
   responses of CO2-exchange rates would lead to higher respiratory carbon
   losses at night, relative to potential daily gains, in lowland compared
   with lower montane forests.
   Methods Gas-exchange measurements were used to determine water-, light-,
   CO2- and temperature-response curves of net photosynthesis and dark
   respiration of 18 tropical bryophyte species from three altitudes (sea
   level, 500 m and 1200 m) in Panama.
   Key Results Optimum temperatures of net photosynthesis were closely
   related to mean temperatures in the habitats in which the species grew
   at the different altitudes. The ratio of dark respiration to net
   photosynthesis at mean ambient night and day temperatures did not, as
   expected, decrease with altitude. Water-, light- and CO2-responses
   varied between species but not systematically with altitude.
   Conclusions Drivers other than temperature-dependent metabolic rates
   must be more important in explaining the altitudinal gradient in
   bryophyte abundance. This does not discard near-zero carbon balances as
   a major problem for lowland species, but the main effect of temperature
   probably lies in increasing evaporation rates, thus restricting the time
   available for photosynthetic carbon gain, rather than in increasing
   nightly respiration rates. Since optimum temperatures for photosynthesis
   were so fine tuned to habitat temperatures we analysed published
   temperature responses of bryophyte species worldwide and found the same
   pattern on the large scale as we found along the tropical mountain slope
   we studied.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeGlobal warming is expected to have profound effects on
   terrestrial carbon (C) fluxes, consequently influencing future climate.
   Biocrusts are important sources of C in the C cycle of desert
   ecosystems, where vascular plants are restricted by limited soil
   moisture. This study was conducted in order to evaluate the expected
   increases in temperature on soil respiration in biocrust-dominated
   areas.Materials and methodsIn a field warming experiment, we evaluated
   the impact of increased temperature on soil respiration in
   biocrust-dominated (moss-crusted and lichen-crusted) areas in Shapotou,
   China. In addition, the impacts of precipitation, soil temperature, and
   moisture on soil respiration were investigated.Results and discussionThe
   effect of warming on soil respiration varied with soil water
   availability. Our results showed that soil respiration in moss-crusted
   and lichen-crusted areas in the warming treatment was significantly
   lower than that in the control. The observed inhibition of soil
   respiration by the increase in soil temperature was likely due to the
   reduction in soil moisture caused by the increased water evaporation
   rate under higher soil temperature. Warming also decreased cumulative C
   release in moss-crusted and lichen-crusted areas. Moreover, cumulative C
   release showed marked seasonal variations, with the highest C release
   occurring in summer and the lowest in winter. Over the seasonal cycle,
   soil respiration rates were positively correlated with precipitation,
   soil temperature, and volumetric soil water content.ConclusionsThe
   results of this study indicate that warming may increase the sensitivity
   of soil respiration to water availability in biocrust-dominated areas in
   desert ecosystems, suggesting that biocrust should be considered in
   projections of future C budget.}},

Title = {{Soil respiration sensitivity to temperature in biocrusted soils in a
   desert-shrubland ecosystem}},
Journal = {{CATENA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{191}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A precise prediction of the response in soil respiration (R-s) to
   climate warming requires the temperature-driven portion of the response
   to be characterized separately from the global, undecomposed response.
   Eliminating non-temperature-driven effects, which tend to confound the
   response in R-s is possible with Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA), a
   non-parametric approach to timeseries analysis. R-s and ancillary data
   were collected at three microsites in a desert-shrubland ecosystem in
   northwest China over a three-year period (i.e., 2013-2015). The
   microsites include desert-sites with non-biocrusted, lichen-crusted, and
   moss-crusted soil surfaces, or NC, LC, and MC, respectively. Results
   revealed that temperature sensitivity in R-s (i.e., Q(10)) based on the
   original, un-processed R-s-data and a seasonal equation relating R-s to
   temperature were similar among microsites, with similar amplitudes in
   R-s. High-frequency bins of R-s with sub-signals with a period < 90
   days, obtained by subtracting the low-frequency bins from timeseries of
   R-s were positively correlated with soil moisture (theta) at all
   microsites. Whereas, the same high-frequency bins were individually
   decoupled from soil temperature at LC and MC. This suggests that the
   influence of theta on the response in R-s to temperature dominated the
   R-s-measurements over the shorter term. After eliminating the
   non-temperature effects on R-s with SSA, Qio tended to produce lower
   values, i.e., 1.40, 1.28, and 1.34 for NC, LC and MC, respectively, when
   compared to cases where non-temperature effects were not removed,
   yielding a mean of 2.28. Q(10)-values estimated with SSA-processed
   R-s-data were consistent with those published at the ecosystem level
   (i.e., Re similar to 1.40). The research suggests that SSA-adjusted
   Q(10)-values tend to be similar with those at the ecosystem scale.
   Future theoretical work is anticipated using a convergent
   temperature-only-based value of Q(10 )between R-s and R-e across
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Photosynthetic and respiratory CO2 gas exchange was measured under
   controlled climate conditions in the laboratory in two epiphytic
   lichens, Lobaria pulmonaria and Platismatia glauca, with the aim of
   modelling their net productivity using field microclimate data. For
   both, the thallus water content (WC) and the light intensity had the
   greatest impact on photosynthesis. L. pulmonaria had optimum net
   photosynthesis (NP) at WCs between 75-175\% of the thallus dry weight
   (DW), while P. glauca required a WC of c. 85\% for maximal NP without
   depression at higher WCs. Both species reached light compensation of NP
   at 5-10 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) and were saturated at 100-150 mu mol
   photons m(-2) s(-1). Respiratory CO2 loss corresponded to 35-40\% of
   gross photosynthesis at. 85-100\% WC and 15 degrees C, in both species.
   Growth of the two species were followed in transplanted thalli during a
   16-month period at two contrasting sites, a forest edge adjacent to a 15
   year old clear-cut and within the interior of a mature Picea abies
   forest. At these sites, the microclimate parameters; light, temperature,
   relative humidity (RH) and thallus WC were also monitored. Judged from
   the microclimate data, the lichens were active for 13-19\% of the time
   with thallus WC monitoring, where >60\% of the active time occurred in
   darkness. When photosynthetically active, the edge transplants received
   a 2-3 times higher light dose and were active for a longer accumulated
   time compared to the interior transplants. The field microclimate data
   in conjunction with the laboratory data predicted a 4 times higher DW
   yield of the edge transplants compared to the interior transplants.
   However, the DW yield of L. pulmonaria was overestimated at the edge and
   underestimated for P. glauca in the interior by our model. Possible
   reasons for these discrepancies and the validity of using laboratory
   data and microclimate monitoring to predict growth rates of lichens

Abstract = {{Foliicolous lichens complete their life cycles upon non-deciduous leaves
   in humid tropical and subtropical environments. The anatomy of these
   lichens and its adaptations to this specialized niche have received only
   limited attention. The present work examines the structural organization

   south-west Florida, USA. Thalli with their leaf substratum were embedded
   in resin and examined with SEM in backscattered electron detection mode.
   All species showed a continuous, covering epilayer of fungal origin that
   consisted of relatively sparse, scattered cell lumina of reduced
   diameter connected by cell wall-derived material. Fungal cells were
   intermixed below this layer, with algal cells often resting directly on
   the substratum. Interactions between symbionts were mainly limited to
   wall-to-wall contacts without penetration. The epilayer showed
   continuity with the fungal prothallus at the perimeter of the thalli.
   Crystalline deposits in the upper portions of thalli were common,
   particularly in the species of Gyalectidium examined. All thalli were
   entirely epicuticular; some covered the stomata of the leaf beneath. It
   is suggested that the prominence of non-living wall materials and
   mineral crystals in thallus structure might serve to minimize the
   metabolic cost of fungal tissue in climates where warm temperatures at

Abstract = {{Biological soil crusts (BSCs) across desert ecosystems play an important
   role in modulating terrestrial carbon cycles. Global warming and changes
   in precipitation patterns are expected to be important triggers for
   biological activity in BSC-dominated desert ecosystems. Therefore, it is
   crucial to study the effects of warming and rainfall pulses on soil
   respiration dynamics at BSC-dominated microsites to predict terrestrial
   carbon cycling under climate change. In this study, soil respiration
   rates were monitored continuously during three types of natural
   precipitation events in lichen-dominated and moss-dominated crusts in
   both control and warming treatments. Our results revealed that soil
   respiration was inhibited in BSC-dominated microsites in the warming
   treatment because of reduced soil water content induced by the warmer
   conditions, and that the extent of inhibition was lower in the
   lichen-dominated crusts than in the moss-dominated crusts. During all
   the precipitation events, soil respiration rates were significantly
   increased by rainfall pulses and gradually declined thereafter. Over the
   daily cycle, the clockwise diel hysteresis loop between soil respiration
   and soil temperature was modified by soil water availability, which was
   affected by the magnitude of rainfall pulses. Moreover, the effect of
   photosynthetically active radiation and the mismatch between the depth
   of carbon dioxide (CO2) production and soil temperature measurement may
   have contributed to the diel hysteresis pattern. Our results indicated
   that warming and different types of precipitation events in
   BSC-dominated desert ecosystems impact soil carbon release through
   changes in the magnitude of soil respiration.}},

Abstract = {{An apparent paradox exists in the ecology of Antarctic lichens: their
   net photosynthetic temperature optimum (around 0 degrees C) lies far
   below the temperature optima of their constituent algae and fungi (
   around 20 degrees C). To address this paradox, we consider lichens as
   microbial communities and propose the ``community adaptation''
   hypothesis, which posits that in each thermal regime there is an
   equilibrium between photosynthetic primary producers (photobionts), and
   heterotrophic consumers (mycobiont and parasymbiont fungi). This
   equilibrium, expressed as the producer/consumer ratio (R-p/c), maximizes
   the fitness of the community. As respiration increases with temperature,
   more rapidly than does photosynthesis, R-p/c will shift accordingly in
   warm habitats, resulting in a high-growth temperature optimum for the
   community (the lichen). This lends lichens an adaptive flexibility that
   enables them to function optimally at any thermal regime within the
   tolerance limits of the constituent organisms. The variable equilibrium
   of producers and consumers may have a similar role in thermal adaptation

Abstract = {{A positive soil carbon (C)-climate feedback is embedded into the
   climatic models of the IPCC. However, recent global syntheses indicate
   that the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (R-S) in drylands,
   the largest biome on Earth, is actually lower in warmed than in control
   plots. Consequently, soil C losses with future warming are expected to
   be low compared with other biomes. Nevertheless, the empirical basis for
   these global extrapolations is still poor in drylands, due to the low
   number of field experiments testing the pathways behind the long-term
   responses of soil respiration (R-S) to warming. Importantly, global
   drylands are covered with biocrusts (communities formed by bryophytes,
   lichens, cyanobacteria, fungi, and bacteria), and thus, R-S responses to
   warming may be driven by both autotrophic and heterotrophic pathways.
   Here, we evaluated the effects of 8-year experimental warming on R-S,
   and the different pathways involved, in a biocrust-dominated dryland in
   southern Spain. We also assessed the overall impacts on soil organic C
   (SOC) accumulation over time. Across the years and biocrust cover
   levels, warming reduced R-S by 0.30molCO(2)m(-2)s(-1) (95\% CI=-0.24 to
   0.84), although the negative warming effects were only significant after
   3years of elevated temperatures in areas with low initial biocrust
   cover. We found support for different pathways regulating the
   warming-induced reduction in R-S at areas with low (microbial thermal
   acclimation via reduced soil mass-specific respiration and -glucosidase
   enzymatic activity) vs. high (microbial thermal acclimation jointly with
   a reduction in autotrophic respiration from decreased lichen cover)
   initial biocrust cover. Our 8-year experimental study shows a reduction
   in soil respiration with warming and highlights that biocrusts should be
   explicitly included in modeling efforts aimed to quantify the soil
   C-climate feedback in drylands.}},

Pages = {{100-114}},
Abstract = {{The paper studies the seasonal dynamics of pine and spruce root
   respiration in the northern taiga plant communities, depending on the
   light conditions and nitrogenous nutrition. The highest respiration rate
   (releasing CO2) of roots of woody plants is observed in June and July in
   the period of the growth of the vegetative organs. In August when the
   shoot growth is completed, the intensity of pine and spruce root
   respiration rate decreases in spite of the favorable weather conditions.
   In July the respiration rate of absorbing pine roots in a lichen pine
   forest at the temperature of 20.0. degrees C is 1.52 mg CO2 per g needle
   dry weight. In August the respiration rate at the same temperature does
   not normally exceed 1.09 mg CO2. Selective cutting in the bilberry birch
   forests increases in 5-8 years the illumination under the canopy by
   25-35 thous. lx, reduces the warming-up period of a soil root zone up to
   the root active temperature by 2 weeks, intensifies the root respiration
   rate of the overtopped spruce by 1.41.9 times. The illumination
   necessary for the efficient root activity of the overtopped spruce in
   the 53-, 59-years-old birch forests is reached by cutting of 50-52 \% of
   birch growing stock. Nitrogen fertilizers, applied in the lichen pine
   forests and bilberry birch forests, increase the root respiration rate
   of pine and spruce by 1.4-1.7 times and intensify physiological activity
   of a tree. The nitrogen dosage necessary for the efficient activity of
   the tree root systems is approximately 180 kg of the primary nutrient
   per 1 ha. Both the increase and deficiency of a nitrogen dosage under
   the normal climate conditions reduce the energy rate of pine and spruce
   roots, disturb the physiological activity and growth rate in the
   aboveground tree portions. In the rainy conditions they intensify CO2
   releasing rate by the roots. Selective cutting in the bilberry birch
   forests intensifies the root activity of the overtopped spruce. Positive
   influence of nitrogen applied in the forest stands on the root
   respiratory metabolism as a result of the root competition for food is
   slightly reduced. According to the intensity of roots breathing, it is
   possible to define and set the parameters of thinning out of wood canopy
   and a dose of mineral feed for the highest productivity of plantings.}},

   could last through all daylight hours, resulting in a negative carbon
   balance when nocturnal rates of respiration were high. Often, after
   rainfall, there was a brief, high peak of NP when optimal WC was
   transiently attained before metabolic activity finally ceased through
   desiccation. Other periods with profitable rates of NP occurred after
   moderate moistening of the lichens by dew, fog or light rain. The
   lichens were found to perform identically in the field and laboratory.
   When the two data sets were compared it was clear that the full range of
   WC produced in the laboratory also occurred in nature and that the
   productivity of the epilithic lichens was regularly and severely limited
   by high WC. It is concluded that blockage of diffusive pathways for CO2
   in the thallus through high water contents is an important ecological
   factor for productivity of these central European epi lithic lichens.}},

Abstract = {{Winter soil respiration (R-s) is becoming a significant component of
   annual carbon budgets with more warming in winter than summer. However,
   little is known about the controlling mechanisms of winter R-s in
   dryland. We made continuous measurements of R-s in four microsites
   (non-crust (BS), lichen (LC), moss (MC), and a mixture of moss and
   lichen (ML)) in a desert shrub-land ecosystem northern China, to
   investigate the causes of R-s dynamics in winter. The mean winter R-s
   ranged from 0.10 to 0.17 mu mol CO2 m(-2).s(-1) across microsites, with
   the highest value in BS. Winter Q(10) (known as the increase in
   respiration rate per 10 degrees C increase in temperature) values
   (2.8-19) were much higher than those from the growing season (1.5). R-s
   and Q(10) were greatly enhanced in freeze-thaw cycles compared to frozen
   days. Diurnal patterns of R-s between freeze-thaw and frozen days
   differed. Although the freeze-thaw period was relatively short, its
   cumulative R-s contributed significantly to winter R-s. The presence of
   biocrust might induce lower temperature, thus having fewer freeze-thaw
   cycles relative to bare soil, leading to the lower R-s for microsites
   with biocrusts. In conclusion, winter R-s in drylands was sensitive to
   soil temperature (T-s) and T-s-induced freeze-thaw cycles. The
   temperature impact on R-s varied among soil cover types. Winter R-s in
   drylands may become more important as the climate is continuously
   getting warmer.}},

Abstract = {{In polar ecosystems primary producers have to cope with the very limited
   living conditions of the harsh climate. Vascular plants in the Northern
   Hemisphere extend to the northern-most edges of the continents, but only
   two taxa are present as far south as the Antarctic Peninsula region in
   the Southern Hemisphere. Lower plants, lichens in particular, become
   more important with increasing latitudes and form the dominant element
   of the Antarctic vegetation. Based on recent investigations and
   literature, this paper discusses to what extent lichens are better
   adapted to snow and ice than vascular plants. Vascular plants in high
   latitudes have high freezing tolerances but are photosynthetically
   inactive in winter (e.g., evergreen coniferous species), while lichens
   in a highly freezing-tolerant stage can be active and productive under
   winter conditions. Vascular plants can be active under snow but have no
   photosynthesis if the tissue is frozen. Recent in situ measurements
   indicate that lichens are able to photosynthesize at temperatures below
   -10-degrees-C, apparently in the frozen state. It was also found that
   photosynthetic CO2 exchange of dry thalli can be activated by snow
   during frost. Water uptake during winter was also recorded for
   coniferous trees at the arctic timberline. This uptake may reduce water
   stress in conifers but apparently has no relevance for metabolic
   activity. Water uptake from snow and metabolic activity at -10-degrees-C
   are possible for lichens because they are able to photosynthesize at
   water potentials lower than -20 MPa. Although lichens are adapted to be
   active in snow at low temperatures, strong light on clear days may
   inhibit the photosynthetic apparatus.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 6}},
Abstract = {{Soil respiration induced by biological soil crusts (BSCs) is an
   important process in the carbon (C) cycle in arid and semi-arid
   ecosystems, where vascular plants are restricted by the harsh
   environment, particularly the limited soil moisture. However, the
   interaction between temperature and soil respiration remains uncertain
   because of the number of factors that control soil respiration,
   including temperature and soil moisture, especially in BSC-dominated
   areas. In this study, the soil respiration in moss-dominated crusts and
   lichen-dominated crusts was continuously measured using an automated
   soil respiration system over a one-year period from November 2015 to
   October 2016 in the Shapotou region of the Tengger Desert, northern
   China. The results indicated that over daily cycles, the half-hourly
   soil respiration rates in both types of BSC-covered areas were commonly
   related to the soil temperature. The observed diel hysteresis between
   the half-hourly soil respiration rates and soil temperature in the
   BSC-covered areas was limited by nonlinearity loops with semielliptical
   shapes, and soil temperature often peaked later than the half-hourly
   soil respiration rates in the BSC-covered areas. The average lag times
   between the half-hourly soil respiration rates and soil temperature for
   both types of BSC-covered areas were two hours over the diel cycles, and
   they were negatively and linearly related to the volumetric soil water
   content. Our results highlight the diel hysteresis phenomenon that
   occurs between soil respiration rates and soil temperatures in
   BSC-covered areas and the negative response of this phenomenon to soil
   moisture, which may influence total C budget evaluations. Therefore, the
   interactive effects of soil temperature and moisture on soil respiration
   in BSC-covered areas should be considered in global carbon cycle models
   of desert ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide exchange of the epilithic, green algal lichen Lecanora
   muralis and the weather conditions in its natural habitat in the
   Botanical Garden, Wurzburg (Bavaria, Germany), were monitored by means
   of an automatic cuvette. The continuity of the data over a total of 15
   months of measurements enabled integrals to be calculated of diet,
   monthly, seasonal, and annual sums of photosynthetic carbon income
   (SigmaNP), respiratory carbon loss (SigmaDR) and carbon budget (net
   primary production, SigmaC = SigmaNP - SigmaDR).
   Annual SigmaNP for the period July 1995 through June 1996 was 50021 mg
   m(-2) year(-1) but respiratory processes lost 57\% of this n year Much
   smaller so that SigmaC amounted to 21494 mg m(-2) year(-1) (20.7\% of
   thallus carbon content). If summer 1996, which had a I productivity than
   summer 1995, is included, annual SigmaC was only 15.8\% of carbon
   content for the period October 1995 through September 1996.
   The lichen showed extremely high variability in its daily CO2 exchange,
   and performance depended almost completely on the momentary hydration
   conditions. Diet SigmaNP and SigmaC were not greatly influenced by
   thallus temperature, and manner of moistening was more important than
   high PPFD. Days with favourable primary production occurred in all
   seasons. Negative diet SigmaC was frequent through the year and carbon
   loss occurred on 25\% of the 274 days of the year on which the lichen
   was metabolically active. The various weather response types, because of
   their characteristic influence on the mode and extend of thallus
   hydration, differed considerably in their contribution to the annual
   carbon balance of the lichen. 74 days of heavy rain during the year
   produced only 4.2\% of the annual SigmaC, because, under Such
   conditions, SigmaDR was high and SigmaNP was limited by depression of
   thallus gas exchange due to suprasaturation. In contrast, days with dew
   (40.0\% of annual SigmaC in 105 days) or those with nocturnal rain and
   subsequent drying (28.5\% in 57 days) were the best contributors to
   annual SigmaC.
   Differences in the frequency of occurrence of the different weather
   condition types through the year meant that lichen productivity
   apparently followed a seasonal pattern, each season resulting in a
   positive carbon balance. Autumn and Summer 1995 were the most productive
   seasons, and the lowest was spring with no more than 18\% of the autumn
   production. In summer, the season which was covered twice during the
   measurements, SigmaC was less than one fourth in 1996 of that in 1995,
   underlining the high variability in the photosynthetic production of the
   lichen. Thus, firm generalisations are still not possible about
   seasonality of production for this species.
   There was no correlation between monthly SigmaC and monthly rainfall.
   Due to the complex interdependencies of CO2 exchange of L. muralis
   simple predictions of its carbon budget from meteorological standard
   data are likely to be very difficult or even impossible.}},

   early spring CO2 gas exchange of lichen-dominated biocrusts in central
   Spain}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Biocrusts, communities dominated by mosses, lichens,
   cyanobacteria, and other microorganisms, largely affect the carbon cycle
   of drylands. As poikilohydric organisms, their activity time is often
   limited to short hydration events. The photosynthetic and respiratory
   response of biocrusts to hydration events is not only determined by the
   overall amount of available water, but also by the frequency and size of
   individual rainfall pulses.
   Methods: We experimentally assessed the carbon exchange of a biocrust
   community dominated by the lichen Diploschistes diacapsis in central
   Spain. We compared the effect of two simulated precipitation patterns
   providing the same overall amount of water, but with different pulse
   sizes and frequency (high frequency: five mm/day vs. low frequency: 15
   mm/3 days), on net/gross photosynthesis and dark respiration.
   Results: Radiation and soil temperature, together with the watering
   treatment, affected the rates of net and gross photosynthesis, as well
   as dark respiration. On average, the low frequency treatment showed a
   46\% +/- 3\% (mean +/- 1 SE) lower rate of net photosynthesis, a 13\%
   +/- 7\% lower rate of dark respiration, and a 24\% +/- 8\% lower rate of
   gross photosynthesis. However, on the days when samples of both
   treatments were watered, no differences between their carbon fluxes were
   observed. The carbon flux response of D. diacapsis was modulated by the
   environmental conditions and was particularly dependent on the
   antecedent soil moisture.
   Discussion: In line with other studies, we found a synergetic effect of
   individual pulse size, frequency, environmental conditions, and
   antecedent moisture on the carbon exchange fluxes of biocrusts. However,
   most studies on this subject were conducted in summer and they obtained
   results different from ours, so we conclude that there is a need for
   long-term experiments of manipulated precipitation impacts on the carbon
   exchange of biocrusts. This will enable a more complete assessment of
   the impacts of climate change-induced alterations in precipitation
   patterns on biocrust communities.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of alectorioid lichens in subalpine spruce fir forests
   of north-central British Columbia is strongly influenced by vertical
   position within the canopy; Bryoria dominates upper canopy exposures,
   while Alectoria dominates lower canopy positions. The hypothesis that
   this height-related niche partitioning reflects differential growth
   responses to gradients in canopy microclimate is examined. Field
   measurements of canopy microclimate, taken over a 2-year period, were
   used in conjunction with laboratory-based measurements of net
   photosynthesis (NP) and dark respiration to model net assimilation (NA)
   response of Alectoria sarmentosa and Bryoria spp. (mixed collections of
   Bryoria fremontii and B. pseudofuscescens) at two different heights (15
   and 4 m) within the canopy. Microclimate measurements indicate that
   lichen thalli are regularly hydrated from snowmelt events during the
   winter period (October-April), totalling 26 and 29\% of the time,
   respectively, for Alectoria and Bryoria, though most winter hydration
   exposure (c. 75\%) occurred in the dark. In the summer (May-September),
   rainfall was the major hydration source, with Alectoria and Bryoria each
   hydrated c. 16\% of the time (45\% of this in the dark). The NP
   temperature optimum (T-opt) in light saturated thalli of Alectoria was
   18.1 and 22.9degreesC, for winter and summer measurements, respectively.
   In Bryoria the corresponding seasonal rise in T-opt was smaller, from
   15.9 to 16.3degreesC. Both species showed an increase in maximum rates
   of NP during the summer period, from 1.52 to 1.92 mg CO2 g(-1) h(-1) for
   Alectoria, and from 1.79 to 2.33 mg CO2 g(-1) h(-1) for Bryoria.
   Although lichen hydration events peaked in early winter (October and
   November), NA modelling predicts that maximum growth should occur during
   the summer period. In Alectoria, higher rates of NA were predicted for
   thalli in lower canopy positions, especially during the summer months.
   In Bryoria, no clear trends of NA uptake with canopy position were
   observed. Thus, while NP response to gradients of canopy microclimate
   may provide a basis for niche partitioning in Alectoria, other factors
   (perhaps exclusionary) may be more important for Bryoria. One such
   factor is documented, namely the greater sensitivity of Bryoria to
   extended hydration exposure and we speculate that greater rates of
   fragmentation in upper canopy exposures may limit upper canopy biomass
   accumulation in Alectoria. Niche partitioning in these alectorioid
   lichens may therefore reflect both positive (growth responses) and
   negative (physical and physiological limitations) responses to gradients
   in canopy microclimate. (C) 2003 The British Lichen Society. Published

Abstract = {{The responses of soil respiration to environmental conditions have been
   studied extensively in various ecosystems. However, little is known
   about the impacts of temperature and moisture on soils respiration under
   biological soil crusts. In this study, CO2 efflux from
   biologically-crusted soils was measured continuously with an automated
   chamber system in Ningxia, northwest China, from June to October 2012.
   The highest soil respiration was observed in lichen-crusted soil
   (0.9360.43 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and the lowest values in algae-crusted
   soil (0.73+/-0.31 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Over the diurnal scale, soil
   respiration was highest in the morning whereas soil temperature was
   highest in the midday, which resulted in diurnal hysteresis between the
   two variables. In addition, the lag time between soil respiration and
   soil temperature was negatively correlated with the soil volumetric
   water content and was reduced as soil water content increased. Over the
   seasonal scale, daily mean nighttime soil respiration was positively
   correlated with soil temperature when moisture exceeded 0.075 and 0.085
   m(3) m(-3) in lichen-and moss-crusted soil, respectively. However,
   moisture did not affect on soil respiration in algae-crusted soil during
   the study period. Daily mean nighttime soil respiration normalized by
   soil temperature increased with water content in lichen-and moss-crusted
   soil. Our results indicated that different types of biological soil
   crusts could affect response of soil respiration to environmental
   factors. There is a need to consider the spatial distribution of

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Two models for predicting the hydration status of lichens were developed
   as a first step towards a mechanistic lichen productivity model. A
   biophysical model included the water potential of the air, derived from
   measurements of air temperature, relative humidity and species-specific
   rate constants for desiccation and rehydration. A reduced physical
   model, included only environmental parameters, assuming instantaneous
   equilibration between the lichen and the air. These models were
   developed using field and laboratory data for three green algal lichens:
   the foliose epiphytic Platismatia glauca (L.) W. Culb., the fruticose
   epiphytic Alectoria sarmentosa (Ach.) Ach. and the fruticose,
   terricolous and mat-forming Cladina rangiferina (L.) Weber ex Wigg. The
   models were compared and validated for the same three species using data
   from a habitat with a different microclimate. Both models predicted the
   length and timing of lichen hydration periods, with those for A.
   sarmentosa and P. glauca being highly accurate-nearly 100\% of the total
   wet time was predicted by both the biophysical and physical models.
   These models also predicted an accurate timing of the total realized wet
   time for A. sarmentosa and P. glauca when the lichens were wet. The
   model accuracy was lower for C. rangiferina compared to the epiphytes,
   both for the total realized wet time and for the accuracy of the timing
   for the hydration period. These results demonstrate that the stochastic
   and continually varying hydration status of lichens can be simulated
   from biophysical data. Further development of these models to also
   include water-related activity, light and temperature conditions during
   the hydration events will then be a potent tool to assess potential
   lichen productivity in landscapes and habitats of various microclimatic
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrous oxide is a strong greenhouse gas and atmospheric ozone-depleting
   agent which is largely emitted by soils. Recently, lichens and
   bryophytes have also been shown to release significant amounts of
   nitrous oxide. This finding relies on ecosystem-scale estimates of net
   primary productivity of lichens and bryophytes, which are converted to
   nitrous oxide emissions by empirical relationships between productivity
   and respiration, as well as between respiration and nitrous oxide
   release. Here we obtain an alternative estimate of nitrous oxide
   emissions which is based on a global process-based non-vascular
   vegetation model of lichens and bryophytes. The model quantifies
   photosynthesis and respiration of lichens and bryophytes directly as a
   function of environmental conditions, such as light and temperature.
   Nitrous oxide emissions are then derived from simulated respiration
   assuming a fixed relationship between the two fluxes. This approach
   yields a global estimate of 0.27 (0.19-0.35) (TgN(2)O) year(-1) released
   by lichens and bryophytes. This is lower than previous estimates but
   corresponds to about 50\% of the atmospheric deposition of nitrous oxide
   into the oceans or 25\% of the atmospheric deposition on land.
   Uncertainty in our simulated estimate results from large variation in
   emission rates due to both physiological differences between species and
   spatial heterogeneity of climatic conditions. To constrain our
   predictions, combined online gas exchange measurements of respiration
   and nitrous oxide emissions may be helpful.}},

   EXCHANGE PATTERNS OF CHARACTERISTIC LICHEN SPECIES}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{188}},

Abstract = {{CO2 exchange, water content, and microclimate conditions were observed
   for seven characteristic lichen species in their natural habitat within
   upland tundra communities of northern Alaska. Diurnal courses of lichen
   gas exchange response were recorded over five-day periods during the
   arctic summer and fall (from July to early September 1988 and 1989).
   Water availability is the environmental factor of foremost importance in
   determining rates of primary production. Water sources were rain, fog,
   and dew fall, as well as high air humidity, which alone could reactivate
   most of the green algal species after desiccation. Despite high
   variability in environmental conditions, certain patterns in the diurnal
   course of thallus hydration occurred repeatedly, so that five different
   weather types were defined within which gas exchange performance was
   predictable.
   Even short periods of favourable hydration were used by lichens for
   positive net photosynthesis (NP). There was no indication of adverse
   consequences of `'resaturation respiration''. Even after a dry period of
   3 days, sudden rehydration resulted in carbon gain without delay. For
   short periods of time, the combinations of water content, temperature
   and light imposed on the lichens enables high rates of NP. Individual
   species differed greatly in their maximal NP rate, which correlated with
   chlorophyll and nitrogen content. At favourable times in the field,
   observed NP rates approached the maximum capacity found in laboratory
   experiments at natural ambient CO2. Often with sufficient hydration,
   carbon gain was limited by light. CO2 exchange became negative even
   during daylight hours due to the effects of fog and clouds with light
   below compensation levels. Reduced but still positive rates of NP were
   observed with snow and with frozen lichens.
   In order to draw general conclusions about activity over the summer
   season, the time was calculated for a characteristic set of sampling
   days during which thalli were inactivated due to dehydration (no CO2
   exchange measurable), during which they photosynthetically fixed CO2,
   and during which CO2 was released. The thalli were inactivated on the
   average 42.5\% of the time. Species-specific differences with respect to
   the total period of dehydration were surprisingly small (from 39.0\% for
   Stereocaulon alpinum to 45.5\% for Cetraria cucullata). Thus,
   growth-form specific morphology and anatomy of the samples, which were
   exposed side-by-side at the same site did not result in large
   differences in active phases. On the other hand, differences in
   physiological traits between species result in varying division of
   active phases with respect to positive and negative NP. For example,
   Dactylina arctica photosynthesized 1.36 times longer than Peltigera
   malacea. Other traits tend to offset the negative effect of long periods
   with respiratory CO2 release. As a result, the cyanobacterial lichen
   Peltigera malacea with the shortest total period of positive NP was,
   nevertheless, the most productive species due to its high photosynthetic
   capacity. Our field observations strengthen the viewpoint that studies
   of lichen physiological differentiation are essential for understanding
   species autecology and that approaches based on interpretation of
   morphological attributes may sometimes be exaggerated in their
   importance.}},

   exchange of three Leptogium species of a lower montane rainforest in

Abstract = {{Diel time courses of microclimate, hydration, and CO2 exchange of
   Leptogium azureum, L. cyanescens, and L. phyllocarpum (homoiomerous
   cyanolichens) were measured under quasi-natural conditions at a forest
   edge of a lower montane, tropical rain-forest (Panama). In addition,
   responses to experimentally controlled water content (WC),
   photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), and temperature were studied
   for L. phyllocarpum. Performance of the Leptogium species was compared
   with two other, but heteromerous, cyanolichens from the same site and
   treated in earlier publications (Dictyonema glabratum, Sticta
   tomentosa).
   Net photosynthesis (NP) of L. phyllocarpum was adapted to high
   temperatures with an upper temperature compensation point well above 40
   degrees C. The light saturation of NP was highly dependent on WC and
   occurred at PPFD levels between 100 and 600 mu mol m(-2)s(-1). Light
   compensation point was about 20 mu mol m(-2)s(-1) and increased with
   decreasing WC. All three Leptogium species suffered from a strong
   depression of NP at suprasaturating WC, which reduced CO2 assimilation
   by 55 to more than 80\%, compared to the maximum.
   Natural NP was controlled by the interplay of thallus hydration and
   radiation. In contrast to the heteromerous species, high water holding
   capacity of the gelatinous lichens, especially of L. phyllocarpum,
   shortened the periods of inactivity through desiccation, thus
   essentially extending the daily time span for photosynthetic activity.
   However, high WC reduced the rates of CO2 fixation. A rough estimate for
   L. azureum reveals that net photosynthetic carbon gain would be
   increased by about one third in the absence of suprasaturation
   depression.
   In spite of these limitations, average daily net photosynthetic carbon
   gain of mature thalli of all three Leptogium species was relatively high
   {[}between 6.2 and 9 mgC (gC)(-1)d(-1), as related to thallus carbon
   content]. However, a very large portion of assimilated carbon - on
   average 60 to 90\% - was lost again through nocturnal respiration which
   was stimulated by high night temperatures of the continuously moist
   thalli. The resulting diel carbon balance amounted from 0.6 to 3.6 mgC
   (gC)(-1)d(-1) Abundance of Leptogium species and of other macrolichens
   was high in the lower montana forest, it was low in warmer lowland
   rainforests of the same area. Based upon a literature review for lichens
   under different climate conditions the existing hypothesis is discussed
   to what extend this phenomenon might be explained through negative
   carbon balances due to temperature-induced increases in nocturnal
   respiration.}},

Abstract = {{Arctic and alpine terricolous lichens are adapted to harsh environments
   and are tolerant to extremely low temperatures when metabolically
   inactive. However, there are reports indicating that freezing can be
   lethal to metabolically active lichens. With a projected warmer and more
   unstable climate, winter precipitation at high latitudes will fall more
   frequently as rain, causing snowmelt and encapsulating terricolous
   lichens in ice or exposing them to large temperature fluctuations.
   Lichens are a major winter food source for reindeer in most parts of the
   circumpolar region. A laboratory experiment tested how three hydrated
   reindeer forage lichen species covered by snow, encapsulated in ice, or
   uncovered responded to storage at freezing temperatures and subsequent
   warming. Photosynthetic performance (maximal fluorescence of
   dark-adapted samples and net photosynthetic rates) was significantly
   lower in lichens not insulated by snow or ice, whereas there were few
   differences between the snow and ice treatments. It is suggested that
   snow and ice provide sufficiently moist environments to improve
   extracellular and reduce intracellular ice nucleation activity. Ice
   encapsulation, which is often lethal to vascular plants, did not have
   any negative effects on the studied lichens. The results indicate that
   complete snow and ice melt followed by refreezing can be detrimental to
   terricolous lichen ecosystems. Reduced lichen biomass will have a
   negative effect both on reindeer winter survival and the indigenous

Abstract = {{Studies of cryptogam responses to climate change in the polar regions
   are scarce because these slow-growing organisms require long-term
   monitoring studies. Here, we analyse the response of a lichen and moss
   community to 10 years of passive environmental manipulation using
   open-top chambers (OTCs) in the maritime Antarctic region. Cover of the
   dominant lichen Usnea antarctica declined by 71 \% in the OTCs. However,
   less dominant lichen species showed no significant responses except for
   an increase in Ochrolechia frigida, which typically covered dying lichen
   and moss vegetation. There were no detectable responses in the moss or
   associated micro-arthropod communities to the influence of the OTCs.
   Based on calculated respiration rates, we hypothesise that the decline
   of U. antarctica was most likely caused by increased net winter
   respiration rates (11 \%), driven by the higher temperatures and lower
   light levels experienced inside the OTCs as a result of greater snow
   accumulation. During summer, U. antarctica appears unable to compensate
   for this increased carbon loss, leading to a negative carbon balance on
   an annual basis, and the lichen therefore appears to be vulnerable to
   such climate change simulations. These findings indicate that U.
   antarctica dominated fell-fields may change dramatically if current
   environmental change trends continue in the maritime Antarctic,
   especially if associated with increases in winter snow depth or
   duration.}},

   biologically crusted soils by different lichen species in drylands}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{794}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Biocrusts are an essential soil surface cover at drylands where
   ecosystems are especially fragile to soil degradation processes due to
   climatic peculiarities. In the present work, (micro)biological and
   physicochemical properties indicative of soil functionality were studied
   in two different biocrust types dominated by Dipolschistes diacapsis and
   Lepraria isidiata and in underlying soil at two different depths (SL1,
   soil layer right below the biocrusts, and SL2, soil layer underlying
   SL1) at the Tabernas desert (southeast Spain). The influence of climatic
   factors (rainfall and temperature) and general soil properties on the
   (micro)biological properties were also analyzed in different
   environmental (climatic) conditions over a period of two years.
   PERMANOVA analyses showed significant statistical differences (Pseudo-F
   = 63.9; P (perm) = 0.001) among biocrust and soil layers. Throughout the
   study period, enzyme activities involved in C, N, and P cycles;
   microbial biomass-C; basal respiration; and several properties directly
   related to ecosystem productivity (total organic carbon, total nitrogen,
   concentration of ammonium and nitrate) were higher in both biocrust
   types than in the underlying soil layers, showing that biocrusts
   improved soil functions related to nutrient cycling. These properties
   progressively diminished in successive soil layers under the biocrusts
   (biocrusts > SL1 > SL2). Biocrusts showed greater similarity to each
   other and to SL1 than to SL2 in (micro)biological properties. A
   distance-based linear model analysis showed that total organic carbon,
   rainfall, pH, mineralized NNH4+, and total nitrogen were the most
   important variables for predicting (micro)biological soil properties in
   biocrusts. Different biochemical behavior between the biocrusts and
   successive underlying soil layers has been found in wet periods. After
   rainfall periods, the biocrusts showed important peaks in basal soil
   respiration and in enzyme activities involved in C and P cycles.
   Nevertheless, soil biochemical properties hardly showed any peak in SL1
   and did not change in SL2 despite soil moisture being higher in the soil
   layers below the biocrusts. Correlation analyses corroborated the
   existence of different relationships between soil moisture and enzymatic
   activities. In biocrusts, soil moisture showed a greater number of
   significant positive correlations with enzymes such as beta-glucosidase,
   invertase, and phosphomonoesterase among others, whereas in SL1 it was
   only correlated with cellulase and in SL2 with dehydrogenase. A change
   in rainfall regime, as predicted by models based on climate change in
   arid and semiarid zones, could affect the activity of soil enzymes in
   the biocrusts and underlying layers, thus aggravating the degradation of
   these fragile dryland ecosystems. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Uptake and loss of water by six lichen species from the Argentine
   Islands, Antarctic Peninsula, were studied in their natural habitat and
   in laboratory studies. Under field conditions, during a period of rain,
   uptake of moisture ranged from 15\% d w h(-1) for Usnea antarctica to
   almost 90\% for Mastodia tesselata, Loss rates after the rain ceased
   were lower than the uptake rates and ranged from 8.5\% d w h(-1) in
   Umbilicaria decussata to 38.8\% in M. tesselata. A comparison of thalli
   of M. tesselata from the shoreline with thalli collected further inland
   showed significant differences in maximum water content and in rates of
   water loss and uptake between thalli from these sites, which could be
   ascribed to the presence of salt in the thalli of M. tesselata from the
   shore. Thallus samples of Usnea antarctica collected from an exposed
   site showed lower uptake rates and higher loss rates of water than
   samples collected from a more sheltered site. Under laboratory
   conditions the maximum moisture content ranged from 67\% in Usnea
   antarctica to 391\% in M. tesselata. Exposed to an atmosphere of c. 40\%
   relative humidity and c. 15 degrees C, lichen thalli lost their water

   depend on the morphology and anatomy of the lichen thalli. The results

   Photochemical quantum yield was estimated as DELTAF/F(m)' and related to
   thallus water content as well as microclimatic conditions. Lichens were
   photosynthetically active only when moistened by snow fall or by run-off
   from snow melt. The levels of photosynthetic activity in the field for
   all species were influenced by microenvironmental conditions and
   patterns in response were site and species specific. Highest levels of
   photosynthetic efficiency occurred when thalli were at intermediate
   water contents. Photosynthetic activity was reduced by cold as well as
   warm, bright conditions. Highest thallus water contents occurred during
   the middle of the day after substantial falls of snow. P. minuscula
   maintained highest thallus water contents at all sites and appears to
   have a high water compensation point which is related to its observed
   distribution patterns. Umbilicaria decussata studied in the laboratory
   did not become photosynthetically active even when exposed to 95\%

   active except when moistened by snow. Usnea sphacelata exposed to the
   atmosphere had low thallus water contents (ca 30\%) which was not
   related to RH. The results indicate that the lichens are
   photosynthetically inactive for most of the summer period and are
   totally reliant on snow as a water supply. This is important when

Abstract = {{Diel (24-h) time courses of CO2 exchange, water relations, and
   microclimate of the foliose lichen, Sticta tomentosa (Swartz) Ach., and
   responses to experimentally manipulated conditions were measured at a
   forest edge in a lower montane rainforest in Panama.
   Similar to earlier observations on two other rain forest lichens, daily
   desiccation suppressed net photosynthesis (NP) during the period when
   irradiation was highest. Not surprisingly, the light response curves of
   NP showed saturation at rather low light levels. Rehydration was
   associated with an initial resaturation burst of short duration, which
   could be demonstrated both under natural conditions and experimentally.
   This additional loss of CO2 seems too low to be ecologically relevant.
   Moreover, high thallus hydration was also detrimental to NP: at maximum
   water content net CO2 uptake was depressed by > 50\%. Although NP was
   well adapted to the prevailing high temperatures, the latter also
   stimulated dark respiration. On average, almost 60 \% of the diurnal
   carbon gain was lost during the night.
   In spite of these limitations, the integrated 24-h C gain was quite
   high, on average 0.5 \% of the thallus C content. Whilst these figures
   were determined for horizontally exposed samples, we also assessed the
   role of different exposures on photosynthetic performance. Diel C gain
   was highest under conditions of semi-shade (westerly exposure), which

Title = {{Temporal dynamics of dryland soil CO2 efflux using high-frequency
   measurements: Patterns and dominant drivers among biocrust types,
   vegetation and bare soil}},
Journal = {{GEODERMA}},

Abstract = {{Soil respiration is an important component of the carbon (C) cycle and a
   major contributor to total ecosystem C efflux. Knowledge of the factors
   that drive soil respiration in drylands is limited, despite these
   regions represent more than 40\% of the Earth land's surface. In these
   environments, biocrusts play an important role in CO2 exchange towards
   and from soils. However, the temporal dynamics and main drivers of CO2
   efflux in biocrusts compared to other representative dryland covers such
   as bare soil and soil under perennial grasses, has not been fully
   investigated. In this study, we measured the soil CO2 molar fraction
   (chi(c)) at 2 and 5 cm depths in representative surface covers
   (cyanobacteria and lichen dominated biocrusts, soil under the alpha
   grass Macrochloa tenacissima and bare soil) from a semiarid area in SE
   Spain (Tabernas desert, Almeria) using small solid-state CO2 sensors,
   during one hydrological year. We determined the CO2 efflux (F-s) from
   the 0 to 5 cm soil profile using the gradient method. Our results show
   that soil chi(c) and F-s were low in all surface covers (on average, 464
   ppm at 5 cm) during dry soil periods (soil moisture <0.05 m(3) m(-3)).
   chi(c) and subsequent F-s rapidly increased after rainfall, and showed
   the highest values in the soil under grass (M. tenacissima) and lichen
   biocrusts. Time series analysis of F-s allowed identifying periodic
   patterns in F-s strongly related to moisture and temperature
   periodicities. Moisture was the main driver for F-s on timescales of
   weeks and months, while temperature was the main driver on daily scales.
   Moisture exerted a greater influence on F-s in lichen and soil under
   grass, while temperature had a greater effect on F-s in cyanobacteria
   and bare soil. Estimated annual CO2 efflux was 633 g CO2 m(-2) y(-1) in
   the soil under M. tenacissima, 450 g CO2 m(-2) y(-1) in the lichen
   biocrust, 268 g CO2 m(-2) y(-1) in the cyanobacterial biocrust and 188 g
   CO2 m(-2) y(-1) in the bare soil. On the whole, we demonstrate the
   suitability of automated F-s measurements for characterising rapid
   changes in C efflux from dryland surfaces due to changing environmental
   conditions, which can help improve C predictions in drylands under
   current climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Dew is commonly regarded as an important water source for lichens. This
   is also the case for crustose lichens that are attached to the
   substrate, whether rocks or soil. While being verified during ample
   research on rock-dwelling lichens in the Negev, the findings from
   soil-dwelling lichens (lichen biocrusts) are not conclusive. In the
   Tabernas Desert, the soil surface is characterized by a lush cover of
   crustose lichens. These soil biocrusts (biological soil crusts) were
   reported to use dew for photosynthesis while, at the same time, it was
   also observed that these crustose chlorolichens are relatively
   non-wettable. In an attempt to explore the apparent controversy, two
   year-long meteorological data (minimum air temperature and relative
   humidity, RH), during which chlorolichens were thought to utilize dew
   for photosynthesis (2006-2007) were analyzed. The analysis includes a
   comparison to the meteorological conditions that prevailed in the Negev
   during 135 days of manual dew measurements. As found for the Negev, net
   photosynthesis by the chlorolichens is expected once the RH, as measured
   at the meteorological station, is =90\% while vapor condensation (dew)
   is expected once RH is >= 95\%. RH in the Negev was substantially higher
   than the average RH of 75.0-87.2\% registered during the rainless days
   of 2006-2007 in the Tabernas, implying that RH in the Tabernas is too
   low to facilitate frequent dew formation and net photosynthesis by the
   lichens. Photosynthesis in the Tabernas is mainly confined to rainy
   periods, taking place either due to direct wetting by rain, or following
   vapor condensation from the subsurface (distillation). Our findings do
   not support the view that dew is an important water source for the
   establishment and growth of crustose soil lichens in the Tabernas.
   Moreover, the low RH in the Tabernas may also imply that dew may only
   have a very limited role in providing water to lithobionts in this
   ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Different from soils in other ecosystems, soils in arid and semiarid
   areas are covered by biological soil crusts, which can both assimilate
   and release carbon via their physiological activities. Nevertheless, few
   studies have evaluated carbon flux in biologically crusted soils. In the

   cyanobacterial/lichen-crusted soils, as well as crust-removed soil
   (referred as bareland) in the Gurbantunggut Desert, Northwestern China
   from April to October 2010. We also investigated carbon flux in
   biologically crusted soils after 0, 2, 5, and 15 mm precipitation
   treatments. Carbon flux between crusted soil and bareland had no
   significant difference, with average values of 0.16, 0.2, and 0.12 mu
   mol m(-2) S-1 for moss-crusted soil, cyanobacterial/lichen crusted soil,

   elicited carbon flux, reaching a maximum value of 2.4 mu mol m(-2)

   that in dark respiration. No carbon influx was observed in light
   condition. The average carbon flux rate and total carbon production
   increased exponentially with the precipitation amount. This study
   indicates that biological soil crusts do not increase the respiration of
   soil, but increases the temperature dependence of soil carbon flux

Abstract = {{Links between water and carbon (C) cycles in drylands are strongly
   regulated by biocrusts. These widespread communities in the intershrub
   spaces of drylands are able to use non-rainfall water inputs (NRWI)
   (fog, dewfall and water vapour) to become active and fix carbon dioxide
   (CO2), converting biocrusts into the main soil C contributors during
   periods in which vegetation remains inactive. In this study, we first
   evaluated the influence of biocrust type on NRWI uptake using automated
   microlysimeters, and second, we performed an outdoor experiment to
   examine how NRWI affected C exchange (photosynthesis and respiration) in
   biocrusts. NRWI uptake increased from incipient cyanobacteria to
   well-developed cyanobacteria and lichen biocrusts. NRWI triggered
   biocrust activity but with contrasting effects on CO2 fluxes depending
   on the main NRWI source. Fog mainly stimulated respiration of
   biocrust-covered soils, reaching net CO2 emissions of 0.68 mu mol m(-2)
   s(-1), while dew had a greater effect stimulating biocrust
   photosynthesis and resulted in net CO2 uptake of 0.66 mu mol m(-2)

Abstract = {{Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are an integral part of the soil
   system in arid regions worldwide, stabilizing soil surfaces, aiding
   vascular plant establishment, and are significant sources of ecosystem
   nitrogen and carbon. Hydration and temperature primarily control
   ecosystem CO2 flux in these systems. Using constructed mesocosms for
   incubations under controlled laboratory conditions, we examined the
   effect of temperature (5-35 degrees C) and water content (WC, 20-100\%)
   on CO2 exchange in light (cyanobacterially dominated) and dark
   (cyanobacteria/lichen and moss dominated) biocrusts of the cool Colorado
   Plateau Desert in Utah and the hot Chihuahuan Desert in New Mexico. In
   light crusts from both Utah and New Mexico, net photosynthesis was
   highest at temperatures > 30 degrees C. Net photosynthesis in light
   crusts from Utah was relatively insensitive to changes in soil moisture.
   In contrast, light crusts from New Mexico tended to exhibit higher rates
   of net photosynthesis at higher soil moisture. Dark crusts originating
   from both sites exhibited the greatest net photosynthesis at
   intermediate soil water content (40-60\%). Declines in net
   photosynthesis were observed in dark crusts with crusts from Utah
   showing declines at temperatures > 25 degrees C and those originating
   from New Mexico showing declines at temperatures > 35 degrees C. Maximum
   net photosynthesis in all crust types from all locations were strongly
   influenced by offsets in the optimal temperature and water content for
   gross photosynthesis compared with dark respiration. Gross
   photosynthesis tended to be maximized at some intermediate value of
   temperature and water content and dark respiration tended to increase
   linearly. The results of this study suggest biocrusts are capable of CO2
   exchange under a wide range of conditions. However, significant changes
   in the magnitude of this exchange should be expected for the temperature
   and precipitation changes suggested by current climate models.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of biological soil crusts (biocrusts) for the
   biogeochemistry of drylands is widely recognized. However, there are
   significant gaps in our knowledge about how climate change will affect
   these organisms and the processes depending on them. We conducted a
   manipulative full factorial experiment in two representative dryland
   ecosystems from central (Aranjuez) and southeastern (Sorbas) Spain to
   evaluate how precipitation, temperature and biocrust cover affected the
   assimilation and net C balance of biocrusts. Chlorophyll fluorescence,
   net photosynthesis and dark respiration were measured in situ bimonthly
   during a year. We also conducted daily cycle measurements of net
   photosynthesis in winter and at the end of spring. In Sorbas, warming
   reduced the fixation of atmospheric C in biocrust-dominated microsites
   throughout the year. In Aranjuez, there was an interaction between the
   three factors evaluated; during winter, net photosynthesis was
   significantly greater in high biocrust cover plots under natural
   conditions and in the rainfall exclusion treatment. During the daily
   surveys, rainfall exclusion and warming reduced C fixation in Sorbas and
   in Aranjuez respectively. The effects of the treatments evaluated varied
   with the rainfall and non-rainfall water inputs (NRWIs) registered
   before the measurements. Our results suggest that changes in NRWI
   regimes as consequence of warming could have a greater impact on the C
   balance of biocrusts than changes in rainfall amounts. They also
   indicate that climate change may reduce the photosynthetic ability of
   lichens, with a consequent reduction of their dominance in biocrust
   communities at the mid to long term. This could reduce the ability of
   dryland ecosystems to fix atmospheric C.}},

Abstract = {{Methane emissions from reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) fed lichens
   (mainly Cladonia stellaris) and a concentrate feed were determined using
   open-circuit respirometry. The lichen diet was low in crude protein

   respiration chamber. The reindeer were adapted to these diets for
   >4weeks prior to experiments and methane emissions recorded for two

   average by 0.93g/h (or by 5.8 times) in the first hour after feeding the

   study of carbon cycling in the High Arctic, we aimed to estimate the

   the net photosynthesis (Pn) and dark respiration (R) rates of C.
   delisei. Experiments were conducted in the snow-free season of 2000
   using an open-flow gas exchange system with an infrared gas analyser.
   Positive photosynthetic activities were observed on rainy days or soon
   after rainfall when the thallus water content was high, whereas
   photosynthetic activities dropped below the detectable limit on clear
   days because of the low thallus water content. Under a sufficiently high
   thallus water content and close to light saturation, Pn was nearly
   constant over a wide temperature range of 4-20 degrees C, while R
   increased with increasing temperature. We constructed a model for
   estimating the net primary production (NPP) of lichen based on the
   relationships between abiotic factors and the CO2 exchange rate. The
   mean, minimum and maximum NPP values in the snow-free season, estimated

Abstract = {{Flux measurements at sites of mixed hardwood and black spruce stands
   from an area (C4) of the Caribou-Poker Creek Research Watershed (CPCRW),
   interior Alaska, in the summer seasons of 1998, 1999, and 2000 are used
   to estimate the fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O before and after forest
   fires. The FROSTFIRE burning experiment was executed in typical boreal
   forest from 8 to 15 July 1999. The forest fire significantly decreased
   soil CO2 and N2O emissions, by at most 50\%. On the contrary, CH4 flux
   from the soil increased from 7 to 142\%, suggesting that the forest fire
   plays a role in accelerative thawing of the frozen soil, and
   subsequently the release of CH4 from permafrost. Most of the CH4 was
   oxidized in the soil after the fire; however, some was released from the
   soil when the permafrost maximally thawed at the end of August 1999 and
   September 2000. Relationships between the fluxes of trace gases and soil
   temperature before and after the fire showed good exponential
   correlations, indicating that soil temperature was one of the factors
   determining the fluxes of trace gases on boreal forest soils. Also, the
   higher soil temperature after the fire may be led to the enhanced
   diffusion of CO2, CH4 and N2O by microbial activity between the
   atmosphere and the forest soils, and to the increased fluxes of trace
   gases in burned black spruce stand soils. In order to understand the
   roles of moss and lichen mats on the black spruce stands, the net
   respiration by mosses and lichens was estimated with light and dark
   chamber measurements. Net respiration corresponds to 42 to 58\% of the
   total soil respiration before fire. Therefore, the net respiration by
   moss and lichen layers was responsible for one-half of total soil CO2
   emissions. The maximum regional net respiration rate by moss and lichen
   mats on black spruce forest floors of central Alaska was 0.018 +/- 0.009
   GtC/yr, an important source of atmospheric CO2 in boreal forests. After
   the prescribed burn, soil respiration was attributable only to
   respiration by roots and microbes. The microbial respiration estimated
   after the fire is almost three times as high as that the calculated
   respiration before the fire. This finding indicates the post-fire
   condition may stimulate microbial respiration because of higher
   nutrients and substrates in remnant soils and enhanced soil temperature.
   The microbial respiration can be estimated 14.7 tC/ha in burned black
   spruce stands over a decade after the fire, suggesting burned black
   spruce forests in central Alaska are a crucial source of atmospheric
   CO2.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to assess initial effects of warming on the
   CO2 balance of a lichen-rich dwarf shrub tundra, a widespread but little
   studied ecosystem type in the Arctic. We analyzed whole ecosystem carbon
   exchange rates as well as nutrient dynamics, microbial and plant
   community composition and biomass after 2 years of experimental
   temperature increase. Plant biomass increased significantly with
   warming, mainly due to the strong response of lichens, the dominant
   plant group within this ecosystem. Experimental warming also increased
   soil nitrogen pools and nitrogen turnover rates. Major changes in soil
   microbial and plant composition, however, were not detected. Although
   experimental warming increased gross ecosystem productivity, the higher
   plant biomass did not compensate for the much greater increase in C
   losses. Ecosystem respiration and net ecosystem CO2 losses were
   significantly higher in warmed plots compared to control ones. We
   suggest that this was due to increased soil respiration, since soil
   carbon pools were lower in warmed soils, at least in the upper horizons.
   Our study thus supports the general hypothesis that tundra ecosystems
   turn from a carbon sink to a carbon source when temperatures increase in
   the short-term. Since lichens, which produce low quality litter,
   increased their biomass significantly with warming in this specific
   ecosystem type, CO2 losses may slow down in the long-term.}},

Abstract = {{The ecological features of microbial assemblages development in Central
   Evenkia forest soils (64 degrees 15'N, 100 degrees 13'E) were
   investigated on permanently installed sites on the right shore of river
   Kochechum on south- and north-exposition slopes, which differed in
   intensity of solar radiation, thickness of litter and seasonally thawed
   soil horison. We studied mineral soil layer 0-5 and 5-10 cm, including
   ground cover (moss and lichen sinusia). The structure of microbocenoses
   was examined by method of surface. inoculation on Petri dishes,
   microbial biomass and basal respiration by kinetic methods. According to
   the study conducted, oligotropic and copiotrophic group of
   microorganisms dominated in composition of microbocenoses in Central
   Evenkia cryogenic soils, what was due to the peculiarities of cryogenic
   soils of this region. Low soil temperatures, periodic soil overwetting
   and drying, slightly acid reaction of soil environment explained
   predominant development of bacteria in composition of microbial
   complexes (87-95\%) in comparison with fungi. Our observations showed,
   that mineralisation processes proceeded more intensively in ground cover
   of moss sinusia in comparison with lichen sinusia, where the values of
   mineralisation coefficients were higher in the top mineral soil layers.
   Microbial biomass of examined cryogenic soils in natural conditions was
   concentrated mainly in litter subhorison in a moss and lichen sinusia.
   The analysis of microbial basal respiration revealed similar tendencies.
   The values of microbial metabolic coefficient revealed high disturbance
   ratio of ecological-trophic status of microbial communities, when only a
   small part of microbial pool is metabolically active.}},

Abstract = {{Stereocaulon foliolosum a fruticose type of lichen under its natural
   habitat is subjected to low temperature, high light conditions and
   frequent moisture stress due its rocky substratum. To understand as to
   how this lichen copes up with these stresses, we studied the reflectance
   properties, light utilization capacity and the desiccation tolerance
   under laboratory conditions. S. foliolosum showed light saturation point
   for photosynthesis at 390 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) and the light
   compensation point for photosynthesis at 64 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1). Our
   experiments show that S. foliolosum has a low absorptivity (30-35 \%)
   towards the incident light. The maximum rates of net photosynthesis and
   apparent electron transport observed were 1.9 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) and
   45 mu mol e(-) m(-2) s(-1), respectively. The lichen recovers
   immediately after photoinhibition under low light conditions. S.
   foliolosum on subjecting to desiccation results in the decrease of light
   absorptivity and the reflectance properties associated with water status
   of the thalli show a change. During desiccation, a simultaneous decrease
   in photosynthesis, dark respiration and quenching in the fluorescence
   properties was observed. However, all the observed changes show a rapid
   recovery on rewetting the lichen. Our study shows that desiccation does
   not have a severe or long-term impact on S. foliolosum and the lichen is
   also well adapted to confront high light intensities.}},

Title = {{Soil CO2 exchange controlled by the interaction of biocrust successional
   stage and environmental variables in two semiarid ecosystems}},

Abstract = {{Biocrusts are a critical biological community that represents one of the
   most important photosynthetic biomass pools in dryland regions. Thus,
   they play an important role in CO2 fluxes in these regions, where water
   availability limits vascular plant growth and development. The effect of
   biocrusts on CO2 fluxes was expected to be controlled by the interplay
   of several environmental factors, as well as biocrust developmental
   stage and coverage. To test this hypothesis, we performed an in situ
   study during which we measured net CO2 fluxes and dark respiration over
   biocrusted soils at different successional stages in two semiarid
   ecosystems, where biocrusts are one of the main surface components. In
   addition, CO2 flux was measured in annual plants, which were an abundant
   interplant cover in one of the study sites during the measurement
   period. Field campaigns were conducted from early morning to dusk on
   selected days with different environmental conditions over the year.
   Gross photosynthesis was calculated from net CO2 flux and dark
   respiration.
   Biocrusts showed contrasting responses in CO2 exchange depending on
   environmental conditions during the day and the year and depending on
   biocrust developmental stage. CO2 flux in biocrusts was highly
   correlated with soil moisture, but also with photosynthetically active
   radiation and temperature. During dry soil periods, soils colonized by
   biocrusts had net CO2 fluxes close to zero, but after precipitation
   events (light or heavy) all the biocrust types began to photosynthesize.
   When the rainfall was right after an extended drought, the respiration
   by biocrusts themselves and underlying soil exceeded the biocrust gross
   photosynthesis, and consequently soils colonized by biocrusts behaved as
   CO2 sources. On the contrary, consecutive precipitation events and mild
   temperatures caused soil colonization by biocrusts to behave as CO2
   sinks. Annual plants were measured during their senescence and acted as
   CO2 sources during all measurement campaigns. The time of day when the
   biocrusts showed net CO2 fixation depended on the interplay of humidity
   just above them, air temperature and photosynthetically active
   radiation. The biocrust type also significantly influenced CO2 fluxes in
   both semiarid ecosystems. In general, during wet periods, late
   successional biocrusts (i.e. lichens and mosses) had higher gross
   photosynthesis than early successional biocrusts (developed and
   incipient cyanobacteria crusts). Nevertheless, dark respiration from
   late successional biocrusts and underlying soils was also higher than
   from early successional biocrusts, so both biocrust types had similar
   net CO2 fluxes. These results highlight the importance of considering
   the whole soil profile under biocrusts with their associated microbial
   communities as well as the temporal variability of CO2 fluxes in soils
   covered by biocrusts in carbon balance studies in semiarid regions.}},

Abstract = {{Unravelling the role of structural and environmental drivers of gross
   primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R (eco)) in highly
   heterogeneous tundra is a major challenge for the upscaling of
   chamber-based CO2 fluxes in Arctic landscapes. In a mountain birch
   woodland-mire ecotone, we investigated the role of LAI (and NDVI),
   environmental factors (microclimate, soil moisture), and microsite type
   across tundra shrub plots (wet hummocks, dry hummocks, dry hollows) and
   lichen hummocks, in controlling net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE). During
   a growing season, we measured NEE fluxes continuously, with closed
   dynamic chambers, and performed multiple fits (one for each 3-day
   period) of a simple light and temperature response model to hourly NEE
   data. Tundra shrub plots were largely CO2 sinks, as opposed to lichen
   plots, although fluxes were highly variable within microsite type. For
   tundra shrub plots, microsite type did not influence photosynthetic
   parameters but it affected basal (that is, temperature-normalized)
   ecosystem respiration (R (0)). PAR-normalized photosynthesis (P (600))
   increased with air temperature and declined with increasing vapor
   pressure deficit. R (0) declined with soil moisture and showed an
   apparent increase with temperature, which may underlie a tight link
   between GPP and R (eco). NDVI was a good proxy for LAI, maximum P (600)
   and maximum R (0) of shrub plots. Cumulative CO2 fluxes were strongly
   correlated with LAI (NDVI) but we observed a comparatively low GPP/LAI
   in dry hummocks. Our results broadly agree with the reported functional
   convergence across tundra vegetation, but here we show that the role of
   decreased productivity in transition zones and the influence of
   temperature and water balance on seasonal CO2 fluxes in sub-Arctic
   forest-mire ecotones cannot be overlooked.}},

Abstract = {{The lichens Parmelia olivacea and Parmeliopsis ambigua are common
   epiphytes in subarctic forests in Europe. They differ in abundance and
   vertical distribution particularly on birch trees, and these differences
   relate to the level and duration of the winter snow cover. Parmeliopsis
   ambigua is covered much of the cold season on the lower trunk whereas P.
   olivacea occurs well above the snow surface. Periods over 6 months under
   snow have no apparent effect on P. ambigua thalli while much shorter
   snow cover has been demonstrated to kill P. olivacea. It was
   hypothesized that the contrasting distributions are due to differences
   in growth rates and in size and quality of non-structural carbon stores
   in their tissues affecting their endurance to extended periods of dark
   respiration. To test these hypotheses, growth measurements were
   performed on both species and their thalli were sampled for chemical
   analyses. The results show that the mean annual margin extension growth
   of P. olivacea thalli was significantly higher than that of P. ambigua,
   i.e. 1.1 mm and 0.5 mm, respectively. The average nonstructural
   carbohydrate concentration in the two species did not differ, but the
   annual concentration of storage lipids (triacylglycerol) in P. ambigua
   was four times higher than that in P. olivacea, despite a shorter
   growing season and lower rate of photosynthesis. The proportion of
   polyunsaturated fatty acids in structural (polar) lipids was high in
   both species, i.e. 77\% in P. olivacea and 64\% in P. ambigua, which
   appears to enable both species to withstand low ambient thallus
   temperatures. The higher concentration of storage lipids in P. ambigua
   allows survival in environments where P. olivacea would respire to
   death, e.g. under a prolonged snow cover. Parmeliopsis ambigua avoids
   competition by establishing toward the base of the tree trunk, where P.
   olivacea would not survive.}},

Abstract = {{{[}1] We built a remote-sensing method for determining leaf area index

   productivity (NEP) distribution in a boreal forest, interior Alaska, by
   accounting for net primary productivity (NPP) of the vegetation
   compositions and soil respiration observation synchronized to the
   spectral observation. Spectral reflectance and soil respiration were
   observed in two 30- m x 30- m plots in black spruce stands, central

   leaves were used as input parameters of a radiative transfer model to
   evaluate nadir reflectances of spruce communities in relation to varying
   upper layer LAI, forest floor bryophyte types, and leaf spectral
   characteristics. Using the relationship, we obtained LAI and bryophyte
   area ratios for each pixel that corresponds to spruce forest on Landsat

   of the annual soil respiration and NPP of the upper layer and forest
   floor, annual NEP geographical distribution in a recent normal year was
   estimated from remotely sensed LAI and forest floor bryophyte area
   ratios. The annually estimated NEP was 51 g C/m(2)/yr, which corresponds

Abstract = {{Summertime ecosystem respiration (ER) rates through seven sites were
   measured at an upland tundra on Fildes Peninsula in maritime Antarctica

   climatic factors on tundra ER rates. Overall the highest ER rates
   occurred at the tundra top, followed at the middle slope, and the lowest
   rates at the lower slope. The daily highest ER rates occurred at noon
   whereas the lowest at 6 am. There was a significant positive correlation
   (P < 0.05) between tundra ER and 0-10 cm soil temperature, but a
   significant negative correlation (P < 0.01) between ER and soil
   moisture. A high Q(10) value of 2.69 was obtained when all the data were
   combined, indicating soil temperature sensitivity of tundra ER. The mean
   ER at the tundra sites with moss coverage (72.2 +/- 4.4 mg CO2 m(-2)

   air temperature, and air humidity were made in a black spruce (Picea
   mariana) boreal woodland near Schefferville, Quebec, Canada, from June
   through August 1990. Nighttime respiration was between 0.5 and 1.5 kg C
   ha(-1) h(-1), increasing with temperature. Net uptake of carbon during
   the day peaked at 3 kg C ha(-1) h(-1), and the daily net uptake over the
   experiment was 12 kg C ha(-1) day(-1). Photosynthesis dropped
   substantially at leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit (VPD) greater than 7
   mb, presumably as a result of stomatal closure. The response of
   ecosystem photosynthesis to incident PPFD was markedly non-linear, with
   an abrupt saturation at 600 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). This sharp saturation
   reflected the geometry of the spruce canopy (isolated conical crowns),
   the frequently overcast conditions, and an increase in VPD coincident
   with high radiation. The ecosystem light-use efficiency increased
   markedly during overcast periods as a result of a more even distribution
   of light across the forest surface. A mechanistic model of forest
   photosynthesis, parameterized with observations of leaf density and
   nitrogen content from a nearby stand, provided accurate predictions of
   forest photosynthesis. The observations and model results indicated that
   ecosystem carbon balance at the site is highly sensitive to temperature,

Abstract = {{The emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) from podzols (Albic Podzols
   (Arenic)) and the factors controlling its spatiotemporal variability in
   the forest ecosystems of the Pasvik Reserve in the Kola Subarctic are
   characterized. Relatively favorable climatic conditions beyond the polar
   circle in summer are responsible for intensive soil respiration. The
   type of forest affects the emission of CO2 from the soil surface. The
   lowest rate of the CO2 emission is typical of the soils under lichen
   pine forest (105-220 mg C/(m(2) h) or 180 g C/m(2) during the
   summertime). Higher rates are observed for the soils under green moss
   pine (170-385 mg C/(m(2) h) or 360 g C/m(2) during the summertime) and
   birch (190-410 mg C/(m(2) h) or 470 g C/m(2) during the summertime)
   forests. This may related to a higher contribution of root respiration
   (44, 88, and 67\%, respectively). Soil respiration and the contribution
   of root respiration to it increase with an increase in the canopy
   density; mass of small roots; microbial biomass; depth of the stony
   layer; soil moistening; and the contents of available carbon, nitrogen,
   phosphorus, and potassium compounds. At the same time, they decrease
   with an increase in the portion of lichens in the ground cover. The
   seasonal dynamics are characterized by the CO2 emission maximums in the
   summer and fall and minimum in the spring. The daily dynamics are

Title = {{Influence of Disturbance on Soil Respiration in Biologically Crusted
   Soil during the Dry Season}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Soil respiration (Rs) is a major pathway for carbon cycling and is a
   complex process involving abiotic and biotic factors. Biological soil
   crusts (BSCs) are a key biotic component of desert ecosystems worldwide.
   In desert ecosystems, soils are protected from surface disturbance by
   BSCs, but it is unknown whether Rs is affected by disturbance of this
   crust layer. We measured Rs in three types of disturbed and undisturbed
   crusted soils (algae, lichen, and moss), as well as bare land from April
   to August, 2010, in Mu Us desert, northwest China. Rs was similar among
   undisturbed soils but increased significantly in disturbed moss and
   algae crusted soils. The variation of Rs in undisturbed and disturbed
   soil was related to soil bulk density. Disturbance also led to changes
   in soil organic carbon and fine particles contents, including declines
   of 60-70\% in surface soil C and N, relative to predisturbance values.
   Once BSCs were disturbed, Q(10) increased. Our findings indicate that a
   loss of BSCs cover will lead to greater soil C loss through respiration.
   Given these results, understanding the disturbance sensitivity impact on
   Rs could be helpful to modify soil management practices which promote
   carbon sequestration.}},

Abstract = {{The terrestrial flora of Antarctica's frozen continent is restricted to
   sparse ice-free areas and dominated by lichens and bryophytes. These
   plants frequently battle sub-zero temperatures, extreme winds and
   reduced water availability; all influencing their ability to survive and
   grow. Antarctic mosses, however, can have canopy temperatures well above
   air temperature. At midday, canopy temperatures can exceed 15 degrees C,
   depending on moss turf water content. In this study, the optimum
   temperature of photosynthesis was determined for six Antarctic moss
   species:Bryum pseudotriquetrum,Ceratodon purpureus,Chorisodontium
   aciphyllum,Polytrichastrum alpinum,Sanionia uncinata, andSchistidium
   antarcticicollected from King George Island (maritime Antarctica) and/or
   the Windmill Islands, East Antarctica. Both chlorophyll fluorescence and
   gas exchange showed maximum values of electron transport rate occurred
   at canopy temperatures higher than 20 degrees C. The optimum temperature
   for both net assimilation of CO(2)and photoprotective heat dissipation
   of three East Antarctic species was 20-30 degrees C and at temperatures
   below 10 degrees C, mesophyll conductance did not significantly differ
   from 0. Maximum mitochondrial respiration rates occurred at temperatures
   higher than 35 degrees C and were lower by around 80\% at 5 degrees C.
   Despite the extreme cold conditions that Antarctic mosses face over
   winter, the photosynthetic apparatus appears optimised to warm
   temperatures. Our estimation of the total carbon balance suggests that
   survival in this cold environment may rely on a capacity to maximize
   photosynthesis for brief periods during summer and minimize respiratory
   carbon losses in cold conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In its natural habitat of stabilized dunes on the island Baltrum (North
   Sea), microclimatic conditions for Cladonia portentosa were recorded
   (air and thallus temperature, rel. humidity, photosynthetically active
   radiation).  In parallel, water content of the lichen (WG, \% of dry
   weight) was determined.  With respect to lichen hydration, the 56
   diurnal courses of measurements, which were spread over several seasons,
   could be grouped into 5 different types:  (1) WG continuously low; (2)
   nocturnal moistening (e.g. by dew fall) and high WG at sunrise; (3) days
   with fog and high WG throughout; (4) days with rain and long lasting
   high WG; (5) lichens covered by snow.
   In addition, during 24 days in the summer and in the winter, diurnal
   courses of CO2 exchange of the lichen were followed together with the WG
   and the microclimatic conditions.  These days could be separated
   according to with the above types.  This provides an overview for the
   performance in production ecology of the lichen.
   The range of water content of the lichen was measured from 7\% to >
   500\%.  Cladonia portentosa was able to absorb water vapor quickly from
   the atmosphere, however, dew, mist, and rain were the main sources for
   hydration.  At a WG between 150 and 180\% and under sufficient light,
   the lichen reached its optimum of net photosynthesis (NP), higher
   degrees of hydration resulted in a slight depression.  The moisture
   compensation point (FKP) of NP was lower in summer (around 20\% WG) than
   in winter (25-35\% WG), due to temperature conditions.  Also under field
   conditions, the lichen maintained photosynthetic activity at
   temperatures below 0-degrees-C.  With optimal conditions (120-200\% WG,
   17-19-degrees-C, 500-900-mu-E m-2 s-1 PAR) maximal rates of NP around 20
   nMol CO2 g-1 DW s-1 were attained.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{116-126}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Assessments of carbon (C) fluxes in the Arctic require detailed data on
   both how and why these fluxes vary across the landscape. Such
   assessments are complicated because tundra vegetation has diverse
   structure and function at both local and regional stales. To investigate
   this diversity, the Arctic Flux Study has used the eddy covariance
   technique to generate ecosystem CO2-exchange data along a transect in
   northern Alaska. We use an extant process-based model of the
   soil-plant-atmosphere continuum to make independent predictions of grass
   photosynthesis and foliar respiration at 9 of the sites along the
   transect, using data on local canopy structure and meteorology. We make
   two key assumptions: (i) soil respiration is constant throughout the
   flux measurement period, so that the diurnal cycle in CO2 exchange is
   driven by canopy processes only (except at two sites where a soil
   respiration-temperature relationship was indicated in the data); and
   (ii) mosses and lichens play an insignificant role in ecosystem C
   exchange, even though in some locations their live biomass exceeds 300 g
   m(-2). We found that even with these assumptions the model could explain
   much of the dynamics of net ecosystem production (NEP) at sites with
   widely differing vegetation structure and moss/lichen cover. Errors were
   mostly associated with the predictions of maximum NEP; the likely cause
   of such discrepancies was (i) a mismatch between vegetation sampled for
   characterizing the canopy structure and that contained within the
   footprint of the eddy covariance flux measurements, or (ii) an increase
   in daytime soil and root respiration. Thus the model results tended to
   falsify our first assumption but not our second. We also note evidence
   for an actual reduction in NEP caused by water stress on warm, dry days
   at some sites, The model-flux comparison also suggests that
   photosynthesis may be less sensitive to low temperatures than leaf-level
   gas-exchange measurements have indicated.}},

   shrubland ecosystem}},
Journal = {{GEODERMA}},

Volume = {{289}},
Pages = {{11-19}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{In Mediterranean ecosystems, the soil biological crust (hereafter
   biocrust) plays a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem functioning. In
   these ecosystems, soil water content can often be a stronger driver of
   soil CO2 efflux than soil temperature, or at least comparable. However,
   little is known on the contribution of the biocrust to soil CO2 efflux
   or how the respiration of the biocrust responds to soil water content
   and temperature. A manipulative experiment was performed in a
   Mediterranean shrubland ecosystem in Sardinia (Italy) to assess the
   contribution of the biocrust to soil CO2 efflux and to identify the main
   environmental drivers of the CO2 efflux. For 19 months, in situ soil CO2
   efflux was measured over two different surfaces: soil deprived of
   biocrust (hereafter Soil) and intact soil (hereafter Soil + BC), and
   estimated by subtraction in a third surface: biocrust (hereafter BC).
   CO2 efflux emitted by Soil, BC and Soil + BC was uniquely driven by soil
   moisture and temperature: BC respiration was mainly controlled by soil
   moisture at 5 cm depth, whereas both soil temperature and water content
   at 20 cm depth determined Soil CO2 efflux. Soil temperature and water
   content at 5 cm depth drove Soil + BC respiration. We also found that
   biocrusts can contribute substantially (up to 60\%) to the total soil
   respiration depending on its moisture content. This contribution
   persists even in periods in which deeper soil layers are inactive, as
   small water pulses can activate the metabolism of carbon in soils
   through lichens, mosses and cyanobacteria associated with the biocrust,
   while deeper soil layers remain dormant. The important differences
   observed in CO2 efflux between Soil and Soil + BC suggest that carbon
   models and budgets may underestimate soil CO2 efflux in spatially
   heterogeneous Mediterranean areas. Our results highlight the importance
   of accounting for the biocrust contribution to soil respiration and its
   response to environmental drivers. We provide an accurate estimation of
   this key component of the carbon cycle at the ecosystem level in water
   limited ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing use of bioclimatic models to quantify the climate

   of these poikilohydric organisms depends on ambient climatic conditions
   interacting with light availability. However, bioclimatic models have

   Flavoparmelia caperata for a high-latitude (56 degrees N) temperate

   of increased 2080s warmth and moisture under low winter light (possibly
   favoring respiration), and increased dormancy during drier and warmer
   summers (possibly reducing photosynthesis), resulting in negative growth
   (mass loss) for future climates. This is in direct contrast to the
   outcome of bioclimatic models applied to the same study site, which
   project increased environmental suitability based on a warmer and wetter
   climate (not considering irradiance). The study cautions that predictors

Abstract = {{Ongoing responses to climate change in arctic-alpine ecosystems,
   including the increasing dominance of deciduous shrubs, involve major

   vary among plant functional groups, a better understanding of their
   contributions to carbon fluxes will help improve predictions of how

   important tundra regions. We used a sequential harvest method to
   estimate growing season functional group contributions to net ecosystem
   exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (ER), and gross photosynthesis
   (GP) in alpine heath-, meadow-, and Salix-dominated shrub communities.
   We also partitioned ER into aboveground and belowground components in
   all three communities. Belowground efflux was the dominant component of
   ER in the heath and meadow communities (63 percent and 88 percent of ER,
   respectively) but contributed only approximately 40 percent of ER in the
   shrub community. The dominant functional group in each community
   contributed most to aboveground exchanges. Estimates for cryptogams were
   uncertain, but indicated a minor role for bryophytes and lichens in
   overall exchange. The results of our novel method of partitioning
   gas-exchange measurements suggest strong differences in the relative

Abstract = {{Arid and semiarid ecosystems make up approximately 41\% of Earth's
   terrestrial surface and are suggested to regulate the trend and
   interannual variability of the global terrestrial carbon (C) sink.
   Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are common dryland soil surface
   communities of bryophytes, lichens, and/or cyanobacteria that bind the
   soil surface together and that may play an important role in regulating
   the climatic sensitivity of the dryland C cycle. Major uncertainties
   exist in our understanding of the interacting effects of changing
   temperature and moisture on CO2 uptake (photosynthesis) and loss
   (respiration) from biocrust and sub-crust soil, particularly as related
   to biocrust successional state. Here, we used a mesocosm approach to
   assess how biocrust successional states related to climate treatments.
   We subjected bare soil (Bare), early successional lightly pigmented
   cyanobacterial biocrust (Early), and late successional darkly pigmented
   moss-lichen biocrust (Late) to either ambient or +5 degrees C above
   ambient soil temperature for 84days. Under ambient temperatures, Late
   biocrust mesocosms showed frequent net uptake of CO2, whereas Bare soil,
   Early biocrust, and warmed Late biocrust mesocosms mostly lost CO2 to
   the atmosphere. The inhibiting effect of warming on CO2 exchange was a
   result of accelerated drying of biocrust and soil. We used these data to
   parameterize, via Bayesian methods, a model of ecosystem CO2 fluxes, and
   evaluated the model with data from an autochamber CO2 system at our
   field site on the Colorado Plateau in SE Utah. In the context of the
   field experiment, the data underscore the negative effect of warming on
   fluxes both biocrust CO2 uptake and losswhich, because biocrusts are a
   dominant land cover type in this ecosystem, may extend to
   ecosystem-scale C cycling.}},

Abstract = {{Lobaria pulmonaria (L.) Hoffm. is an epiphytic lichen common to
   temperate deciduous forests where it copes with large changes in
   temperature and light levels through repeated annual cycles. Samples of
   L. pulmonaria were taken from a deciduous forest in southeastern Canada
   at 35-day intervals from February 1999 to February 2000 and also from a
   rare population in an evergreen forest in March and August 1999. At
   field-ambient temperatures and light levels, the realised photosystem II
   (PSII) electron transport was low both in the summer and winter, with
   transient peaks in the spring and autumn. In contrast, the seasonal
   pattern of potential electron transport measured at a fixed 20 degreesC
   peaked in winter, showing the importance of temperature in driving
   photosynthesis to low levels in the winter despite an acclimation of
   electron-transport potential to exploit the high ambient light. Realised
   gross CO2 up-take was correlated with PSII electron transport at
   mechanistically plausible rates at all sampling sites in the summer but
   not in the winter, indicating electron diversion away from CO2 fixation
   in the winter. Chlorophyll content was highest in the dark summer
   months. The amount of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase
   (RuBisCO) large subunit (LSU) was highest in spring. Changes in the
   level of this hyperabundant protein and in the activity of PSII
   maintained a relatively constant rate of maximum CO2 uptake per RuBisCO
   LSU from April through November, despite great changes in the seasonal
   light and temperature. L. pulmonaria acclimates between light and
   temperature stress in the winter months to light-limitation in the dark
   summer months. Transition intervals in the spring and autumn, with warm,
   bright and wet conditions, are likely the most amenable times for
   growth.}},

Abstract = {{Diel (24-h) time courses of microclimate, water relations, and CO2
   exchange were measured under quasi-natural conditions at a forest edge
   in a lower montane, tropical rainforest in Panama for six Lobariaceae
   (Lobaria crenulata, L. dissecta, Pseudocyphellaria aurata, P. intricata,
   Sticta sublimbata, S. weigelii). Responses to experimentally controlled
   water content (WC), photosynthetic photon fluence rate (PPFR), and
   temperature were studied in most detail with P. aurata.
   Photosynthesis was well adapted to high temperatures, and all species
   exhibited `shade plant' characteristics with low light compensation
   points and low light saturation. Lobatia and Pseudocyphellaria species
   suffered from a strong depression of net photosynthesis (NP) at
   suprasaturating WC; suprasaturation depression was less in cyphellate
   Sticta species.
   Photosynthetic capacity correlated with thallus nitrogen concentration,
   and maximal NP rates of the cyanobacterial Sticta species was 4 to 5
   times higher than that of the green algal Lobatia species. However, high
   rates of NP were uncommon and brief events under natural conditions; the
   different environmental factors were rarely optimal simultaneously.
   Similar to earlier observations with other rainforest lichens, NP ceased
   during the period of highest irradiation on most days due to
   desiccation. During moist periods low light often limited carbon
   fixation, and high thallus hydration was often detrimental to NP. In
   spite of these limitations the maximal daily integrated net
   photosynthetic carbon income (SigmaNP) was quite high especially for the
   Sticta species {[}17(.)3 and 24(.)1 mgC (gC)(-1) day(-1) for S.
   sublimbata and S. weigelii, respectively]. High nocturnal carbon loss,
   due to high night temperatures and continuous hydration, resulted in
   frequent negative diel carbon balances (SigmaC) in all species. The
   average nocturnal carbon loss amounted to 83 and 70\% SigmaNP for P.
   aurata and P. intricata, respectively and to 64 and 59 \% of SigmaNP for
   S. sublimbata and S. weigelii, respectively. Their average diel SigmaC
   was as high as 3(.)7 and 5(.)3 mgC (gC)(-1) day(-1). In contrast, SigmaC
   was much lower for the other species, it amounted to only 0(.)18 mgC
   (gC)(-1) day(-1) for L. crenulata. Thus, the Sticta species stood out
   amongst the species studied for their most successful adaptation of
   photosynthetic productivity to the habitat conditions in the lower
   montane rainforest.}},

Abstract = {{The pore system within the thalli of 13 lichen taxa belonging to the
   family Umbilicariaceae has been studied by means of mercury intrusion
   porosimetry. A characteristic bimodal pore size distribution with a
   central depression around 0.05 mum of equivalent pore radius was
   obtained in all lichen samples. However, clear differences were found
   among the pore size distributions of each lichen taxa. The total thallus
   porosity was undoubtedly related to the anatomy of the medulla. In
   general, a radial plectenchymatic medulla conferred larger porosity to
   the thallus than an arachnoidal one. Maximum thallus water content
   closely depended on the total thallus porosity in the five lichens
   possessing rhizinomorphs. The species with a similar type of medulla
   could be grouped together in a multivariate analysis that considered
   three porosimetric parameters and the maximum thallus water content.
   Umbilicaria cinereorufescens was the most distinct species, with the
   lowest values of total porosity and water storage capacity and the
   largest value of thallus density, apparently due to its
   scleroplectenchymatic medulla. The pore size distribution existing
   inside the thallus of the species studied is discussed in relation to
   the often opposing problems of CO2 exchange and optimal water relations.
   Some results pointed to a large influence of the micropores (<0.05 mum)
   on the water storage capacity of the thallus, while the macropores would
   have a more important role in gas exchange.}},

Abstract = {{Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) on the Colorado Plateau may fuel
   carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling of soil heterotrophic organisms
   throughout the region. Late successional moss and lichen biocrusts, in
   particular, can increase soil C and N availability, but some data
   suggest these biocrust types will be replaced by early successional
   cyanobacterial biocrusts as the region undergoes warming and
   aridification. In this study, we evaluated the short-term interactive
   effects of biocrust successional state and elevated temperature on soil
   heterotrophic C and N cycling (specifically, soil respiration, N2O
   emissions, microbial biomass C and N, and soluble C and N). We collected
   soils following an 87-day greenhouse mesocosm experiment where the soils
   had been topped with different biocrust successional states
   (moss-dominated, cyanobacteria-dominated, or no biocrust) and had
   experienced different temperatures (ambient and warmed), under an
   artificial precipitation regime. Following this pre-incubation mesocosm
   phase, the soils were assessed using a short-term (2-day) laboratory
   incubation to determine the cumulative effect of the elevated
   temperature and altered biocrust successional state on the temperature
   sensitivity of soil heterotrophic C and N cycling. We found that there
   were interactive effects of biocrust successional state and exposure to
   warmer temperatures during the mesocosm phase under greenhouse
   conditions on the rate and temperature sensitivity of soil heterotrophic
   C and N cycling in laboratory incubations. Soils collected from beneath
   late successional biocrusts exhibited higher C and N cycling rates than
   those from beneath early successional crusts, while warming reduced both
   the magnitude and the temperature sensitivity of C and N cycling. The
   inhibiting effect of warming, was most evident in soils from beneath
   late successional biocrusts, which, during the mesocosm phase, also
   exhibited the greatest reductions in gross primary production and
   respiration in response to the warming treatment. Taken together, these
   data suggest that an overall effect of climate warming may be increasing
   resource limitation of the soil heterotrophic C and N cycles in the
   region, which may magnify alterations associated with the changes in
   biocrust community structure documented in previous studies. Overall,
   results from this study suggest that soil heterotrophic biogeochemical
   cycling is affected by interactions between temperature and the biocrust
   community that lives atop the mineral soil, with important implications
   for C and N cycling into the future.}},

Abstract = {{Net photosynthesis (NP) and dark respiration (DR) of thalli of the
   lichen species Umbilicaria grisea and U. freyi growing together in the
   same habitat in the Sierra de Guadarrama, central Spain, were measured
   under controlled conditions in the laboratory and under natural
   conditions in the field over a range of photosynthetic photon flux
   densities (PPFD), thallus temperatures and thallus water contents.
   Laboratory experiments revealed that the photosynthetic response to PPFD
   at optimum thallus water content is very similar in both species. The
   light compensation points of NP increased from PPFD of c. 20 mu mol
   m(-2) s(-1) at 0 degrees C up to c. 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD at 25
   degrees C. In both species light saturation was not reached up to 700 mu
   mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD except at 0 degrees C. By contrast, the temperature
   dependence of CO2 gas exchange differed substantially between U. grisea
   and U. freyi. Both species gave significant rates at 0 degrees C.
   Optimal temperatures of NP were always higher in U. grisea at various
   PPFD levels if the samples were kept at optimal thallus water content.
   NP showed maximal rates at 95\% dw in U. grisea and 110\% dw in U. freyi
   respectively. In U. grisea a much stronger depression of NP was observed
   with only 5\% of maximal NP reached at 180\% dw. At all PPFD and
   temperature combinations U. freyi showed higher rates of NP and more
   negative rates of DR if calculated on a dry weight basis. This was also
   true under natural conditions at the same site, when U. freyi was always
   more productive than U. grisea. The differences in the photosynthetic
   response to temperature between both species correlated well with the
   different distribution patterns of both species. The possibility of
   genetic control of the physiological performance of these species and
   its influence on their distribution patterns and autecology is
   discussed. (C) 1997 The British Lichen Society}},

Abstract = {{Decomposition processes are extremely important in biological soil
   crusts (BSCs). Although the effects of temperature and moisture on such
   processes have been widely studied, little is known about the influence
   of the readily metabolizable substrate (labile C) and how this substrate
   varies in different types of BSCs. In the present study, BSCs formed by
   cyanobacteria (CYANO) and by lichens (DIPLOS and LEPRA) were incubated
   at 25 degrees C (optimum temperature) and different moisture levels, for
   evaluation of the pool of labile C in the crust layers. Labile C was
   estimated as the sum of CO2-C emitted and the C extracted with hot water
   (80 degrees C) at the end of the incubation period. In all crusts, the
   relationship between emission and moisture fitted a quadratic model. For
   the different moisture contents, the sum of CO2-C emitted and C
   extracted with hot water converged to a constant value for each type of
   crust. This value, considered as the maximum content of labile C in the
   crust, was extremely high in DIPLOS, reaching up to 40\% of the total
   organic C (TOC) initially present. In all crusts, and independently of
   the consumption of labile C, simple sugars (sucrose, glucose) remained
   at the end of the incubation period, which suggests that these sugars
   may play a protective role in BSCs. The presence of mannitol suggests
   that the fructose released during hydrolysis of sucrose was reduced to
   mannitol, thus enabling electron transport during moments of intense
   respiratory stress. The intense respiration in DIPLOS is partly due to
   the metabolism of polyphenols, which are possibly derived from the
   growth and death of free-living fungi that proliferate during incubation
   of the crusts. These results demonstrate that the metabolic processes in
   BSCs differ depending on the type of organisms that form the crusts and
   that there is a high risk of C loss from Diploschistes BSCs after heavy
   rainfall events. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   proportion of lichen cover (Cladina sp.) was not correlated with
   ecosystem carbon exchange. Clipping experiments showed that about half
   of the measured ecosystem respiration was heterotrophic. Plots that had
   been protected from reindeer grazing had almost two times higher
   above-ground plant biomass than grazed plots. The reason for this was
   86\% lower lichen biomass on the grazed side of the fell, while the

Abstract = {{Biological soil crusts, formed by an association of soil particles with
   cyanobacteria, lichens, mosses, fungi and bacteria in varying
   proportions, live in or directly on top of the uppermost soil layer. To
   evaluate their role in the global carbon cycle, gas exchange
   measurements were conducted under controlled conditions. Moss-dominated
   soil crusts were first analyzed as moss tufts on soil, then the mosses
   were removed and the soil was analyzed separately to obtain the
   physiological response of both soil and individual moss stems. Net
   photosynthetic response of moss stems and complete crusts was decreased
   by insufficient and excess amounts of water, resulting in optimum curves
   with similar ranges of optimum water content. Light saturation of both
   sample types occurred at high irradiance, but moss stems reached light
   compensation and saturation points at lower values. Optimum temperatures
   of moss stems ranged between 22 and 27A degrees C, whereas complete
   crusts reached similar net photosynthesis between 7 and 27A degrees C.
   Under optimum conditions, moss stems reached higher net photosynthesis
   (4.0 vs. 2.8 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and lower dark respiration rates (-0.9
   vs. -2.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Respiration rates of soil without moss
   stems were high (up to -2.0 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) causing by far lower
   absolute values of NP/DR ratios of soil crusts as compared to moss
   stems. In carbon balances, it therefore has to be clearly distinguished
   between measurements of soil crust components versus complete crusts.
   High rates of soil respiration may be caused by leaching of mosses,
   creating high-nutrient microsites that favor microorganism growth.}},

Abstract = {{Paramos, tropical alpine ecosystems, host one of the world's most
   diverse alpine floras, account for the largest water reservoirs in the
   Andes, and some of the largest soil carbon pools worldwide. It is of
   global importance to understand the future of this extremely carbon-rich
   ecosystem in a warmer world and its role on global climate feedbacks.
   This study presents the result of the first in situ warming experiment
   in two Colombian paramos using Open-Top Chambers. We evaluated the
   response to warming of several ecosystem carbon balance-related
   processes, including decomposition, soil respiration, photosynthesis,
   plant productivity, and vegetation structure after 3 years of warming.
   We found that OTCs are an efficient warming method in the paramo,
   increasing mean air temperature by 1.7 degrees C and mean daytime
   temperature by 3.4 degrees C. The maximum air temperature differences
   between OTC and control was 23.1 degrees C. Soil temperature increased
   only by 0.1 degrees C. After 3 years of warming using 20 OTC (10 per
   paramo) in a randomized block design, we found no evidence that warming
   increased CO2 emissions from soil respiration, nor did it increase
   decomposition rate, photosynthesis or productivity in the two paramos
   studied. However, total C and N in the soil and vegetation structure are
   slowly changing as result of warming and changes are site dependent. In
   Sumapaz, shrubs, and graminoids cover increased in response to warming
   while in Matarredonda we observed an increase in lichen cover. Whether
   this change in vegetation might influence the carbon sequestration
   potential of the paramo needs to be further evaluated. Our results
   suggest that paramos ecosystems can resist an increase in temperature
   with no significant alteration of ecosystem carbon balance related
   processes in the short term. However, the long-term effect of warming
   could depend on the vegetation changes and how these changes alter the
   microbial soil composition and soil processes. The differential response
   among paramos suggest that the response to warming could be highly
   dependent on the initial conditions and therefore we urgently need more
   warming experiments in paramos to understand how specific site
   characteristics will affect their response to warming and their role in
   global climate feedbacks.}},

   successional pathway of the crust communities, the pioneers in
   colonising the soil surface are the cyanobacteria; green algae, mosses
   and lichens then follow. Physical influences such as soil structure and
   types, radiation intensity, and topographic traits such as slope
   directions that affect water availability and soil moisture, influence
   the successional pathways and the soil crust community. When physical
   conditions are the same, disturbances are key factors for a specific
   successional stage. We found a substantial gradient of CO2 exchange at
   the Nizzana site for both respiration and photosynthesis. Samples from
   the sand dunes at the Nizzana site showed a pronounced activity gradient
   with high rates for assimilation (around 70 mu mol CO2 m(-2) min(-1)) as
   well as respiration (60-70 pmol CO2 m(-2) min(-1)) at the base of dunes,
   decreasing towards the top. The soil crust samples of the Negev desert
   show comparable values. Hence, as ecotypes containing such biological
   soil crusts with dominant photosynthetically active organisms are a
   widespread phenomenon in desert, boreal and arctic systems, their
   contribution to the global cycling of trace gases and elements can be
   significant for global budgets. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Polar ecosystems are currently experiencing some of the fastest rates of
   climate warming. An increase in soil temperature in High Arctic regions
   may stimulate soil permafrost melting and microbial activity, thereby
   accelerating losses of greenhouse gases. It is therefore important to
   understand the factors regulating the rates of C turnover in polar
   soils. Consequently, our aims were to: (1) assess the concentration of
   low molecular weight (MW) dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in soil, (2) to
   investigate the temperature-dependent turnover of specific low MW
   compounds, and (3) to analyse the influence of substrate concentration
   on C cycling. Microbial mineralisation of labile low MW DOC in two High
   Arctic tundra soils was investigated using soil solutions spiked with
   either C-14-labelled glucose or amino acids. Spiked solutions were added
   to the top- and sub-soil from two ecosystem types (lichen and Carex
   dominated tundra), maintained at three temperatures (4-20 degrees C),
   and their microbial mineralisation kinetics monitored. (CO2)-C-14
   evolution from the tundra soils in response to C-14-glucose and -amino
   acid addition could best be described by a double first order
   exponential kinetic equation with rate constants k(1) and k(2). Both
   forms of DOC had a short half-life (t(1/2)) in the pool of microbial
   respiratory substrate (t(1/2) = 1.07 +/- 0.10 h for glucose and 1.63 +/-
   0.14 h for amino acids; exponential coefficient k(1) = 0.93 +/- 0.07 and
   0.64 +/- 0.06 h(-1) respectively) whilst the second phase of
   mineralisation, assumed to be C that had entered the microbial biomass,
   was much slower (average k(2) = 1.30 x 10(-3) +/- 0.49 x 10(-4) h(-1)).
   Temperature had little effect on the rate of mineralisation of C-14 used
   directly as respiratory substrate. In contrast, the turnover rate of the
   C-14 immobilized in the microbial biomass prior to mineralisation was
   temperature sensitive (k(2) values of 0.99 x 10(-3) h(-1) and 1.66 x
   10(-3) h(-1) at 4 and 20 degrees C respectively).
   Concentration-dependent glucose and amino acid miner lisation kinetics
   of glucose and amino acids (0-10 mM) were best described using
   Michaelis-Menten kinetics; there was a low affinity for both C
   substrates by the microbial community (K-m = 4.07 +/- 0.41 mM, V-max =
   0.027 +/- 0.005 mmol kg(-1) h(-1)). In conclusion, our results suggest
   that in these C limiting environments the flux of labile, low MW DOC
   through the soil solution is extremely rapid and relatively insensitive
   to temperature. In contrast, the turnover of C incorporated into higher
   molecular weight microbial C pools appears to show greater temperature
   sensitivity. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The tundra ecosystem is quite vulnerable to drastic climate change in
   the Arctic, and the quantification of carbon dynamics is of significant
   importance regarding thawing permafrost, changes to the snow-covered
   period and snow and shrub community extent, and the decline of sea ice
   in the Arctic. Here, CO2 efflux measurements using a manual chamber
   system within a 40m x 40m (5m interval; 81 total points) plot were
   conducted within dominant tundra vegetation on the Seward Peninsula of
   Alaska, during the growing seasons of 2011 and 2012, for the assessment
   of driving parameters of CO2 efflux. We applied a hierarchical Bayesian
   (HB) model - a function of soil temperature, soil moisture, vegetation
   type, and thaw depth - to quantify the effects of environmental factors
   on CO2 efflux and to estimate growing season CO2 emissions. Our results
   showed that average CO2 efflux in 2011 was 1.4 times higher than in
   2012, resulting from the distinct difference in soil moisture between
   the 2 years. Tussock-dominated CO2 efflux is 1.4 to 2.3 times higher
   than those measured in lichen and moss communities, revealing tussock as
   a significant CO2 source in the Arctic, with a wide area distribution on
   the circumpolar scale. CO2 efflux followed soil temperature nearly
   exponentially from both the observed data and the posterior medians of
   the HB model. This reveals that soil temperature regulates the seasonal
   variation of CO2 efflux and that soil moisture contributes to the
   interannual variation of CO2 efflux for the two growing seasons in
   question. Obvious changes in soil moisture during the growing seasons of
   2011 and 2012 resulted in an explicit difference between CO2 effluxes -
   742 and 539 gCO(2) m(-2) period(-1) for 2011 and 2012, respectively,
   suggesting the 2012 CO2 emission rate was reduced to 27\%(95\% credible
   interval: 17-36\%) of the 2011 emission, due to higher soil moisture
   from severe rain. The estimated growing season CO2 emission rate ranged
   from 0.86 Mg CO2 in 2012 to 1.20 Mg CO2 in 2011 within a 40m x 40m plot,
   corresponding to 86 and 80\% of annual CO2 emission rates within the
   western Alaska tundra ecosystem, estimated from the temperature
   dependence of CO2 efflux. Therefore, this HB model can be readily
   applied to observed CO2 efflux, as it demands only four environmental
   factors and can also be effective for quantitatively assessing the
   driving parameters of CO2 efflux.}},

Abstract = {{Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus L.) is considered to be an important
   mammalian herbivore, strongly influencing Arctic lichen-dominated
   ecosystems. There is no wide knowledge about the effect of reindeer on
   greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in northern boreal forests. Ground
   vegetation plays an important role in absorbing nitrogen (N) and carbon
   dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Lately, it has also been found to be
   a significant source of nitrous oxide (N2O) and a small source of
   methane (CH4). We investigated the influence of reindeer grazing on
   field layer GHG (CO2, CH4, and N2O) fluxes, ground vegetation coverage
   and biomass, and soil physical properties (temperature and moisture) in
   a northern boreal forest. At our study site, the reindeer-induced
   replacement of lichen by mosses had contrasting effects on the GHG
   fluxes originating from the field layer. Field layer CO2 efflux was
   significantly higher in grazed areas. The field layer was a CH4 sink in
   all areas, but grazed areas absorbed more CH4 compared to non-grazed
   areas. Although total N2O fluxes remained around 0 in grazed areas, a
   small N2O sink occurred in non-grazed areas with lower moss biomass. Our
   results indicated that grazing by reindeer in northern boreal forests
   affects GHG fluxes from the forest field layer both positively and
   negatively, and these emissions largely depend on grazing-induced
   changes in vegetation composition.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports continuous automated measurements of forest floor
   carbon (C) exchange over feathermoss, lichen, and sphagnum micro-sites
   in a black spruce forest in eastern North America during snow-free
   periods over three years. The response of soil respiration (R(s-auto))
   and forest floor photosynthesis (P(ff)) to environmental factors was
   determined. The seasonal contributions of scaled up R(s-auto) adjusted
   for spatial representativeness (R(s-adj)) and P(ff) (P(ff-eco)) relative
   to that of total ecosystem respiration (R(e)) and photosynthesis
   (P(eco)), respectively, were also quantified.
   Shallow (5 cm) soil temperature explained 67-86\% of the variation in
   R(s-auto) for all ground cover types, while deeper (50 and 100 cm) soil
   temperatures were related to R(s-auto) only for the feathermoss
   micro-sites. Base respiration was consistently lower under feathermoss,
   intermediate under sphagnum, and higher under lichen during all three
   years. The R(s-adj/Re) ratio increased from spring through autumn and
   ranged from 0.85 to 0.87 annually for the snow-free period. The
   R(s-adj/Re) ratio was negatively correlated with the difference between
   air and shallow soil temperature and this correlation was more
   pronounced in autumn than summer and spring.
   Maximum photosynthetic capacity of the forest floor (P(ffmax)) saturated
   at low irradiance levels (similar to 200 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)) and
   decreased with increasing air temperature and vapor pressure deficit for
   all three ground cover types, suggesting that P(ff) was more limited by
   desiccation than by light availability. P(ffmax) was lowest for
   sphagnum, intermediate for feathermoss, and highest for lichen for two
   of the three years. P(ff) normalized for light peaked at air
   temperatures of 5-8 degrees C, suggesting that this is the optimal
   temperature range for P(ff). The P(ff-eco)/P(eco) ratio varied from 13
   to 24\% over the snow-free period and reached a minimum in mid-summer
   when both air temperature and P(eco) were at their maximum. On an annual
   basis, P(ff-eco) accounted for 17-18\% of P(eco) depending on the year
   and the snow-free season totals of P(ff-eco) were 23-24\% that of
   R(s-adj).}},

Abstract = {{Well-documented models of soil respiration and C-3 photosynthesis are
   combined to investigate the overall carbon dioxide balance of a high
   arctic polar semidesert site near Ny-Alesund, Svalbard. Measurements of
   carbon dioxide fluxes from an eddy correlation system and climate
   variables are used to calibrate this combined model for the
   snowmelt-summer period in 1995. Particular emphasis was put on modelling
   effectively the separate soil respiration and net photosynthesis of the
   moss/lichen, vascular plant and bare soil areas within the heterogeneous
   site, and ascertaining whether moss/lichen communities could be
   effectively modelled using a C-3 photosynthetic model. The calibrated
   model of 1995 data was subsequently tested in predictive mode against
   eddy correlation nux measurements recorded in 1996. The model is shown
   to simulate effectively both years and highlights the important role
   that the timing of snowmelt, summer precipitation and soil temperature
   has upon the overall carbon dioxide balance of this site. A previous
   conjecture by the author from the limited flux measurements that the
   investigated period in 1995 was an overall sink for carbon dioxide and
   that the same period in 1996 was an overall source of carbon dioxide is
   borne out by the model runs with 3.9 +/- 3.7 gC m(-2) being assimilated

Abstract = {{The Australian moss frog, Bryobatrachus nimbus, oviposits four to 16
   large eggs in terrestrial nests constructed in moss or lichen in
   subalpine regions of southern Tasmania. Nidicolous larvae overwinter
   beneath snow, reaching metamorphosis without feeding after 395 d, the
   longest development time known for an endotrophic anuran. However, a few
   clutches develop more quickly and metamorphose before winter. This study
   examines the effect of temperature on development time and energy
   expenditure by measuring temperatures and developmental stages in field
   nests as well as rates of oxygen consumption ((V) over dot O-2),
   developmental stage, body mass, and energy content in the laboratory at
   three relevant temperatures (5 degrees, 10 degrees, 15 degreesC). Eggs
   and larvae reared at 5 degreesC differentiated very slowly, and their
   development time far exceeded those in natural nests, but development
   times at 107 and 15 degreesC averaged 277 and 149 d, respectively, and
   were shorter than field incubation times. Generally, respiration rates
   of aquatic hatchlings were low in comparison with other species but
   increased with larval age and jumped about 25\% higher near
   metamorphosis when larvae were able to air breathe. The mean energy
   density was 26.0 J mg(-1) for the dry ova and 20.6 J mg(-1) for a dry
   gut-free froglet, and total production efficiency was 61.5\%. We
   developed a model based on the relationships between incubation
   temperature and (V) over dot O-2 to estimate the respiratory cost of
   development to metamorphosis, the first such study for an amphibian. The
   cost was 177 J at 15 degreesC, 199 J at 10 degreesC, and at least 249 J
   at 5 degreesC, and we predicted that continual development at 5 degreesC
   would lead to premature yolk depletion because it equalled the 249 J
   contained in fresh ova. Continuously logged field-nest temperatures and
   interpolation of laboratory data provided estimates of development
   rates, (V) over dot O-2, and respiratory energy costs in field nests.
   Development to metamorphosis required between 185 and 234 J when larvae
   overwintered, but completion of metamorphosis before winter saved 123 J.
   However, the advantage of emergence in warmer months, when conditions
   are suitable for feeding and growth, may offset the greater energy cost
   of overwintering.}},

Abstract = {{The lichen Turgidosculum complicatulum (formerly Mastodia tesselata)
   occurs in the shore-zone of Marion Island (sub-Antarctic: 47 degreesS,38
   degreesE). Net CO2 exchange in the lichen is dominated by a strong
   temperature-dependence of respiration rate. The light/temperature
   response of photosynthesis is such that under the prevailing climatic
   regime on the island the lichen, if sufficiently hydrated, would exhibit
   near-maximal photosynthesis rates for 75\% of the photoperiod over the
   year. A photosynthetic response model predicts that the lichen's net
   annual carbon acquisition is 3.1 g C g(-1) year(-1) under the current
   solar radiation and temperature regime at the island. The model predicts
   that changes in temperature and radiation by the amounts known to have
   occurred in the past few decades, and even greater changes (temperature
   increase by up to 2 degreesC, radiation by up to 10\%), would negligibly
   affect the annual amount of carbon acquired provided the thalli remain
   hydrated. Incorporating hydration/desiccation cycles into the model
   resulted in a substantial lowering of annual net C exchange. However,
   attempts to include the increase in aridity known to have occurred at
   the island since 1971 gave conflicting scenarios for the effect on
   annual C acquisition, depending on whether atmospheric drying or thallus
   drying was considered.}},

Abstract = {{Arctic ecosystems are characterized by a broad range of plant functional
   types that are highly heterogeneous at small (similar to 1-2 m) spatial
   scales. Climatic changes can impact vegetation distribution directly,
   and also indirectly via impacts on disturbance regimes. Consequent
   changes in vegetation structure and function have implications for
   surface energy dynamics that may alter permafrost thermal dynamics, and
   are therefore of interest in the context of permafrost related climate
   feedbacks. In this study we examine small-scale heterogeneity in soil
   thermal properties and ecosystem carbon and water fluxes associated with
   varying understory vegetation in open-canopy larch forests in
   northeastern Siberia. We found that lichen mats comprise 16\% of
   understory vegetation cover on average in open canopy larch forests, and
   lichen abundance was inversely related to canopy cover. Relative to
   adjacent areas dominated by shrubs and moss, lichen mats had 2-3 times
   deeper permafrost thaw depths and surface soils warmer by 1-2 degrees C
   in summer and less than 1 degrees C in autumn. Despite deeper thaw
   depths, ecosystem respiration did not differ across vegetation types,
   indicating that autotrophic respiration likely dominates areas with
   shrubs and moss. Summertime net ecosystem exchange of CO2 was negative
   (i.e. net uptake) in areas with high shrub cover, while positive (i.e.
   net loss) in lichen mats and areas with less shrub cover. Our results
   highlight relationships between vegetation and soil thermal dynamics in
   permafrost ecosystems, and underscore the necessity of considering both
   vegetation and permafrost dynamics in shaping carbon cycling in
   permafrost ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Following surface disturbance, quaternary sands are the basic substrate
   for soil development in the Lusatian reclamation area. These substrates
   mostly contain few organic matter and, hence, are nutrient poor.
   Accumulation of soil carbon is, an important factor for ecosystem
   development, where biological soil crusts initially influence soil
   processes and promote ecosystem succession. The compositional structures
   of biological soil crusts at various developmental stages and their
   photosynthetic properties were investigated on two former open-cast
   lignite sites, currently under reclamation, an artificial sand dune in
   Welzow Sud, and a forest plantation in Schlabendorf Sud (Brandenburg,
   Germany). As development of biological soil crusts progressed, their
   contents of organic carbon and total chlorophyll increased. The ratio of
   these parameters, however, varied with the relative contribution of
   lichens and mosses in particular. Also maximum photochemical efficiency,
   net photosynthesis and respiration increased with crustal development.
   An additional evaluation of NDVI and chlorophyll fluorescence images
   showed that especially moss-dominated biocrusts had higher
   photosynthetic capacity compared to green algae-dominated biocrusts or
   soil lichens, so the photosynthetic capacity showed to be highly
   species-specific. The ratio of gross photosynthesis to respiration
   indicated a higher ecological efficiency of biocrusts dominated by green
   algae than of lichen-dominated biocrusts. The occurrence of soil lichens
   reduced net CO2 fixation and increased CO2 release due to the enhanced
   mycobiontic respiration. During crustal succession, the rise of
   photosynthesis-related parameters is not necessarily linear as a result
   of the highly heterogenic distribution of the different crustal
   organisms between biocrusts of similar developmental stages as well as
   between those growing at the two study sites. Therefore, the evaluation
   of relevant ecophysiological parameters highlighted that not all
   biocrust-forming organisms similarly contribute to the ecophysiological
   behavior of biological soil crusts. Nevertheless, the occurrence of the
   biological soil crusts promoted soil formation and accumulation of soil
   carbon in initial soils. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dryland ecosystems account for ca. 27\% of global soil organic carbon
   (C) reserves, yet it is largely unknown how climate change will impact C
   cycling and storage in these areas. In drylands, soil C concentrates at
   the surface, making it particularly sensitive to the activity of
   organisms inhabiting the soil uppermost levels, such as communities
   dominated by lichens, mosses, bacteria and fungi (biocrusts). We
   conducted a full factorial warming and rainfall exclusion experiment at
   two semiarid sites in Spain to show how an average increase of air
   temperature of 2-3 degrees C promoted a drastic reduction in biocrust
   cover (ca. 44\% in 4years). Warming significantly increased soil CO2
   efflux, and reduced soil net CO2 uptake, in biocrust-dominated
   microsites. Losses of biocrust cover with warming through time were
   paralleled by increases in recalcitrant C sources, such as aromatic
   compounds, and in the abundance of fungi relative to bacteria. The
   dramatic reduction in biocrust cover with warming will lessen the
   capacity of drylands to sequester atmospheric CO2. This decrease may act
   synergistically with other warming-induced effects, such as the increase
   in soil CO2 efflux and the changes in microbial communities to alter C
   cycling in drylands, and to reduce soil C stocks in the mid to long

Abstract = {{Fire is the most important natural disturbance in boreal forests, and it
   has a major role regulating the carbon (C) budget of these systems. With
   the expected increase in fire frequency, the greenhouse gas (GHG) budget
   of boreal forest soils may change. In order to understand the long-term
   nature of the soil-atmosphere GHG exchange after fire, we established a
   fire chronosequence representing successional stages at 8, 19, 34, 65,
   76 and 179 years following stand-replacing fires in hemiboreal Scots
   pine forests in Estonia. Changes in extracellular activity, litter
   decomposition, vegetation biomass, and soil physicochemical properties
   were assessed in relation to carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and
   nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Soil temperature was highest 8 years
   after fire, whereas soil moisture varied through the fire
   chronosequences without a consistent pattern. Litter decomposition and
   CO2 efflux were still lower 8 years after fire compared with pre-fire
   levels (179 years after fire). Both returned to pre-fire levels before
   vegetation re-established, and CO2 efflux was only strongly responsive
   to temperature from 19 years after fire onward. Recovery of CO2 efflux
   in the long term was associated with a moderate effect of fire on enzyme
   activity, the input of above- and below-ground litter carbon, and the
   re-establishment of vegetation. Soil acted as a CH4 sink and N2O source
   similarly in all successional stages. Compared with soil moisture and
   time after fire, soil temperature was the most important predictor for
   both GHGs. The re-establishment of overstorey and vegetation cover
   (mosses and lichens) might have caused an increase in CH4 and N2O
   effluxes in the studied areas, respectively. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

Abstract = {{Cryptogamic covers, which comprise some of the oldest forms of
   terrestrial life on Earth (Lenton \& Huntingford, ), have recently been
   found to fix large amounts of nitrogen and carbon dioxide from the
   atmosphere (Elbert etal., ). Here we show that they are also greenhouse
   gas sources with large nitrous oxide (N2O) and small methane (CH4)
   emissions. Whilst N2O emission rates varied with temperature, humidity,
   and N deposition, an almost constant ratio with respect to respiratory
   CO2 emissions was observed for numerous lichens and bryophytes. We
   employed this ratio together with respiration data to calculate global
   and regional N2O emissions. If our laboratory measurements are typical
   for lichens and bryophytes living on ground and plant surfaces and
   scaled on a global basis, we estimate a N2O source strength of 0.32-0.59
   Tg year(-1) for the global N2O emissions from cryptogamic covers. Thus,
   our emission estimate might account for 4-9\% of the global N2O budget
   from natural terrestrial sources. In a wide range of arid and forested
   regions, cryptogamic covers appear to be the dominant source of N2O. We
   suggest that greenhouse gas emissions associated with this source might
   increase in the course of global change due to higher temperatures and

Abstract = {{CO2-concentrating mechanisms based on active inorganic C influx across a

   phototrophs, i.e., some lichens and free-living algae and cyanobacteria
   related to the lichen photobionts. The natural occurrence of
   CO2-concentrating mechanisms is negatively correlated with CO2
   enrichment of aquatic habitats from respiration of organic C produced
   elsewhere and, less clearly, with low temperatures during the growing
   season, with low external pH, and with rapid water movement over the
   plant surface. Predictions based on laboratory data and on theoretical
   considerations as to the influence of light, nitrogen, and iron
   availability on the occurrence of CO2-concentrating mechanisms have yet
   to be rigorously tested in the field. The evolution of CO2-concentrating
   mechanisms is not well understood, but clearly the location of inorganic

Abstract = {{We used process-based modelling to investigate the roles of carbon-flux
   (C-flux) components and plant-interspace heterogeneities in regulating
   soil CO2 exchanges (F-S) in a dryland ecosystem with sparse vegetation.
   To simulate the diurnal and seasonal dynamics of F-S, the modelling
   considered simultaneously the CO2 production, transport and surface
   exchanges (e.g. biocrust photosynthesis, respiration and
   photodegradation). The model was parameterized and validated with
   multivariate data measured during the years 2013-2014 in a semiarid
   shrubland ecosystem in Yanchi, northwestern China. The model simulation
   showed that soil rewetting could enhance CO2 dissolution and delay the
   emission of CO2 produced from rooting zone. In addition, an ineligible
   fraction of respired CO2 might be removed from soil volumes under
   respiration chambers by lateral water flows and root uptakes. During
   rewetting, the lichen-crusted soil could shift temporally from net CO2
   source to sink due to the activated photosynthesis of biocrust but the
   restricted CO2 emissions from subsoil. The presence of plant cover could
   decrease the root-zone CO2 production and biocrust C sequestration but
   increase the temperature sensitivities of these fluxes. On the other
   hand, the sensitivities of root-zone emissions to water content were
   lower under canopy, which may be due to the advection of water flows
   from the interspace to canopy. To conclude, the complexity and
   plant-interspace heterogeneities of soil C processes should be carefully
   considered to extrapolate findings from chamber to ecosystem scales and
   to predict the ecosystem responses to climate change and extreme
   climatic events. Our model can serve as a useful tool to simulate the
   soil CO2 efflux dynamics in dryland ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide efflux and soil microenvironment were measured in three
   upland tundra communities in the foothills of the Brooks Range in arctic
   Alaska to determine the magnitude of CO2 efflux rates and the relative
   importance of the belowground factors that influence them. Gas exchange
   and soil microenvironment measurements were made weekly between 14 June
   and 31 July 1990. The study communities included lichen-heath, a sparse
   community vegetated by lichens and dwarf ericaceous shrubs on rocky
   soils, moist Cassiope dwarf-shrub heath tundra, dominated by Carex and
   evergreen and deciduous shrubs on relatively deep organic soils, and dry
   Cassiope dwarf-shrub heath of stone-stripe areas, which was of
   intermediate character.
   Rates of CO2 efflux were similar for the three communities until
   mid-season when they peaked at rates between 4.9 and 5.9 g m(-2) d(-1).
   Following the midseason peak, the rates in all three communities
   declined, particularly in the lichen-heath. Seasonal patterns of CO2
   efflux, soil temperature, and soil moisture suggest changing limitations
   to CO2 efflux over the course of the season. Rates of carbon dioxide
   efflux followed changes in soil temperature early in the season when
   soil moisture was highest. Mid-season efflux appeared to be limited by
   soil, moss, and lichen hydration until the end of July, when temperature
   again limited efflux. Differences between the communities were related
   to microenvironmental differences and probable differences in carbon
   quality. The presence of peat-forming mosses is suggested to play an
   important role in differences in efflux and microenvironment among the

Abstract = {{Many arid and semiarid ecosystems have soils covered with well-developed
   biological soil crust communities (biocrusts) made up of mosses,
   lichens, cyanobacteria, and heterotrophs living at the soil surface.
   These communities are a fundamental component of dryland ecosystems, and
   are critical to dryland carbon (C) cycling. To examine the effects of
   warming temperatures on soil C balance in a dryland ecosystem, we used
   infrared heaters to warm biocrust-dominated soils to 2 A degrees C above
   control conditions at a field site on the Colorado Plateau, USA. We
   monitored net soil exchange (NSE) of CO2 every hour for 21 months using
   automated flux chambers (5 control and 5 warmed chambers), which
   included the CO2 fluxes of the biocrusts and the soil beneath them. We
   observed measurable photosynthesis in biocrust soils on 12 \% of
   measurement days, which correlated well with precipitation events and
   soil wet-up. These days included several snow events, providing what we
   believe to be the first evidence of substantial photosynthesis
   underneath snow by biocrust organisms in drylands. Overall, biocrust
   soils in both control and warmed plots were net CO2 sources to the
   atmosphere, with control plots losing 62 +/- A 8 g C m(-2) (mean +/- A
   SE) over the first year of measurement and warmed plots losing 74 +/- A
   9 g C m(-2). Between control and warmed plots, the difference in soil C
   loss was uncertain over the course of the entire year due to large and
   variable rates in spring, but on days during which soils were wet and
   crusts were actively photosynthesizing, biocrusts that were warmed by 2
   A degrees C had a substantially more negative C balance (i.e., biocrust
   soils took up less C and/or lost more C in warmed plots). Taken
   together, our data suggest a substantial risk of increased C loss from
   biocrust soils with higher future temperatures, and highlight a robust
   capacity to predict CO2 exchange in biocrust soils using easily measured
   environmental parameters.}},

Abstract = {{A model of the daily carbon balance of a black spruce/feathermoss boreal
   forest ecosystem was developed and results compared to preliminary data
   from the 1994 BOREAS field campaign in northern Manitoba, Canada. The
   model, driven by daily weather conditions, simulated daily soil climate
   status (temperature and moisture profiles), spruce photosynthesis and
   respiration, moss photosynthesis and respiration, and litter
   decomposition. Model agreement with preliminary field data was good for
   net ecosystem exchange (NEE), capturing both the asymmetrical
   seasonality and short-term variability. During the growing season
   simulated daily NEE ranged from -4 g C m(-2) d(-1) (carbon uptake by
   ecosystem) to +2 g C m(-2) d(-1) (carbon flux to atmosphere), with
   fluctuations from day to day. In the early winter simulated NEE values
   were +0.5 g C m(-2) d(-1), dropping to +0.2 g C m(-2) d(-1) in
   mid-winter. Simulated soil respiration during the growing season (+1 to
   +5 g C m(-2) d(-1)) was dominated by metabolic respiration of the live
   moss, with litter decomposition usually contributing less than 30\% and
   live spruce root respiration less than 10\% of the total. Both spruce
   and moss net primary productivity (NPP) rates were higher in early
   summer than late summer. Simulated annual NEE for 1994 was -51 g C m(-2)
   y(-1), with 83\% going into tree growth and 17\% into the soil carbon
   accumulation. Moss NPP (58 g C m(-2) y(-1)) was considered to be litter
   (i.e. soil carbon input; no net increase in live moss biomass).
   Ecosystem respiration during the snow-covered season (84 g C m(-2)) was
   58\% of the growing season net carbon uptake. A simulation of the same
   site for 1968-1989 showed approximate to 10-20\% year-to-year
   variability in heterotrophic respiration (mean of +113 g C m(-2) y(-1)).
   Moss NPP ranged from 19 to 114 g C m(-2) y(-1); spruce NPP from 81 to
   150 g C m(-2) y(-1); spruce growth (NPP minus litterfall) from 34 to 103
   g C m(-2) y(-1); NEE ranged from +37 to -142 g C m(-2) y(-1). Values for
   these carbon balance terms in 1994 were slightly smaller than the
   1969-89 means. Higher ecosystem productivity years (more negative NEE)
   generally had early springs and relatively wet summers; lower
   productivity years had late springs and relatively dry summers.}},

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Background We investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of soil carbon
   dioxide (CO2)- and soil methane (CH4)-flux during biological soil crust
   (BSCs) deposition in a sand-binding area in the eastern Chinese Hobq
   Desert. The trends in soil organic carbon (C) content and density were
   analyzed during this process. The sampling sites comprised a mobile dune
   (control) and those with algal, lichen, and moss crust-fixed sands. The
   desert soil CO2- and CH4-flux, temperature, and water content were
   measured from May to October in 2017 and 2018. Simultaneously, organic C
   content and density were measured and analyzed by stratification.
   Results The spatio-temporal variation in desert soil CO2-flux was
   apparent. The average CO2- fluxes in the control, algal, lichen, and
   moss sites were 1.67, 2.61, 5.83, and 6.84 mmol m(-2) h(-1),
   respectively, during the growing season, and the average CH4-fluxes in
   the four sites were - 1.13, - 1.67, - 3.66, and - 3.77 mu mol m(-2)
   h(-1), respectively. Soil temperature was significantly positively
   correlated with CO2-flux but could not influence CH4 absorption, and C
   flux had minimal correlation with soil water content. The soil total
   organic C density at all sites was significantly different and decreased
   as follows: moss > lichen > algal > control; moreover, it decreased with
   soil depth at all sites. The accumulation of desert soil organic C could
   enhance soil C emissions. Conclusion In a semi-arid desert, artificial
   planting could promote sand fixation and BSCs succession; therefore,
   increasing the C storage capacity of desert soils and decreasing soil C
   emissions could alter the C cycle pattern in desert ecosystems. Soil
   temperature is the major factor controlling desert soil CO2 flux and
   vegetation restoration, and BSCs development could alter the response
   patterns of C emissions to moisture conditions in desert soils. The
   results provide a scientific basis for studying the C cycle in desert
   ecosystems.}},

Title = {{Eight years of forest-floor CO2 exchange in a boreal black spruce

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{184}},

Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Automated measurements of the net forest-floor CO2 exchange (NFFE) were
   made in a mature (130-year-old) boreal black spruce forest over an
   8-year period (2002-2009) with the objectives of (1) quantifying the
   spatial and temporal (seasonal and interannual) patterns in NFFE, soil
   respiration (SR) and gross forest-floor photosynthesis (GFFP), and (2)
   better understanding the key climatic controls on each component at both
   time scales. Scaling-up of the component fluxes to the stand level
   showed that the feather moss community accounted for more than 85\% of
   NFFE and SR, and more than 70\% of GFFP. The remainder was partitioned
   almost equally between the sphagnum and lichen communities for all
   components fluxes, while the exposed mineral soil in hollows accounted
   for less than 1\% of NFFE and SR. Soil temperature (T-s) was the
   dominant climate variable determining seasonal trends in NFFE and SR.
   The shape of the exponential response was, however, strongly modulated
   by soil water content (SWC) in the surface organic horizon, with reduced
   apparent temperature sensitivity at low SWC. A lowering of the water
   table depth also had an effect on NFFE and SR, although very weak, with
   increased CO2 loss from the hollows likely due to improved soil
   aeration. Air temperature (T-a) was the dominant climate variable
   determining seasonal trends in GFFP, while plant water status seemed to
   have played a minor role. Although not statistically significant (p =
   0.9907), annual totals of scaled-up NFFE varied from 505 121 to 601 +/-
   144g Cm-2 y(-1) over the 8-year period. The lowest NFFE was observed in
   2004, the coldest and wettest year on record, while the highest was
   observed in 2005, a warmer year with slightly above-average
   precipitation. SR, by far the dominant component of the forest-floor CO2
   exchange, closely followed the inter-annual trends in NFFE, while GFFP
   was lowest in 2004 and highest in 2003, also a cold year but with very
   low precipitation. Over the 8-year period, winter NFFE contributed 7\%
   to annual NFFE while GFFP during the growing season reduced losses due
   to SR by 18\%.
   While strong correlations were observed between the component fluxes and
   temperature (T-s or T-a) and SWC at the seasonal time scale, the mean
   annual values of these climate variables were poor predictors of the
   inter-annual trends when considered individually. Combining
   multiplicatively T-s and SWC for NFFE and SR, and T-a and SWC for GFFP,
   significantly increased the predictive ability of the models. The
   difference in predictability of the two time scales poses some
   interesting challenges for interpreting and modeling the long-term
   temporal trends in NFEE and its components. The results obtained in this
   relatively long-term study suggest that the inter-annual variability in
   the component fluxes was not driven by the mean annual climate
   conditions, but rather the shorter time scale changes in climate
   conditions, i.e. changes that occurred within days, weeks and/or
   seasons. Moreover, it appeared that the timing of the climatic changes
   within each year was also critical, spring and summer conditions having
   a far greater impact than fall and winter conditions in this stand. (C)

Abstract = {{Carbon flux represents carbon uptake from or release to the atmosphere
   in desert ecosystems, yet the changing pattern of carbon flux in desert
   ecosystems and its dependence on soil cover type and rainfall amount are
   poorly understood. We measured net carbon fluxes (NCF) in soil with four
   cover types (moss crusted soil, cyanobacteria/lichen crusted soil,
   bareland and semishrub Ephedra distachya-inhabited site) from April to
   October of 2010 and 2011, and NCF and dark respiration (DR) after four
   rainfall amounts (0, 2, 5, and 15 mm) in cyanobacteria/lichen crusted
   soil, bareland and the E. distachya-inhabited site. NCF in the E.
   djstachya-inhabited site differed significantly from those of the other
   three soil cover types, while no difference was observed between the
   moss and cyanobacteria/ lichen crusted soils or between the two crusted
   soils and bareland on most measurement occasions. NCF ranged from 0.28
   +/- 0.14 to 1.2 +/- 0.07 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in the biologically crusted
   soils, and from 2.2 0.27 to 0.46 0.03 mu mol IT1-2 s(-1) at the E.
   distachya-inhabited site. Daily NCF in the biologically crusted soils
   and bareland showed carbon release at most times and total carbon
   production ranged from 48.8 5.4 gC m(-2) yr(-1) to 50.9 +/- 3.8 gC m(-2)
   yr(-1), while the E. distachya-inhabited site showed a total carbon
   uptake of 57.0 +/- 9.9 gC m(-2) yr(-1). Daily variances in NCF were
   well-explained by variances in surface soil temperature, and seasonal
   NCF showed a significant linear relationship with soil moisture in the
   two biologically crusted soils and bareland when soil volumetric water
   content was less than 3\%. Rainfall elicited intense carbon release in
   cyanobacteria/lichen crusted soil, bareland and at the E.
   distachya-inhabited site, and both NCF and DR were positive in the first
   two days after rainfall treatments. Mean NCF and DR were not different
   between rainfall amounts of 2, 5 and 15 mm in cyanobacteria/lichen
   crusted soil and bareland, while they were significantly higher after 15
   mm rainfall treatment compared with 2 mm and 5 mm treatments at the E.
   distachya-inhabited site. Mean NCF and DR in the first two days
   increased logistically with rainfall amount. Based on our findings, we
   suggest that E. distachya-inhabited sites contribute to carbon uptake in
   the Gurbantunggute Desert, while biologically crusted soils exhibit
   carbon release for most of the year. Even though photosynthesis
   immediately following rainfall can be stimulated, carbon uptake effect
   in biologically crusted soil is likely intermittent and confined to
   periods when moisture is available. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Biodiversity is threatened by climate change and other human activities
   {[}1], but to assess impacts, we also need to identify the current
   distribution of species on Earth. Predicting abundance and richness
   patterns is difficult in many regions and especially so on the remote
   Antarctic continent, due to periods of snow cover, which limit remote
   sensing, and the small size of the biota present. As the Earth's coldest
   continent, temperature and water availability have received particular
   attention in understanding patterns of Antarctic biodiversity {[}2],
   whereas nitrogen availability has received less attention {[}3].
   Nitrogen input by birds is a major nutrient source in many regions on
   Earth {[}4-7], and input from penguins and seals is associated with
   increased plant growth {[}8-10] and soil respiration {[}11-13] at some
   Antarctic locations. However, the consequences of increased nitrogen
   concentrations in Antarctic mosses and lichens for their associated food
   web has hardly been addressed {[}14, 15], despite the fact that nutrient
   status of primary producers affects the abundance and diversity of
   higher trophic levels {[}16, 17]. We show that nitrogen input and delta
   N-15 signatures from marine vertebrates are associated with terrestrial
   biodiversity hotspots well beyond (>1,000 m) their immediate colony
   borders along the Antarctic Peninsula. Invertebrate abundance and
   richness was two to eight times higher under penguin and elephant seal
   influence. The nitrogen footprint area was correlated with the
   vertebrate population size. These findings improve our ability to
   predict biogeographical patterns of Antarctic terrestrial biodiversity
   through knowledge of the location and size of penguin and elephant seal
   concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Biological activity in arid grasslands is strongly dependent on
   moisture. We examined gas exchange of biological soil crusts
   (biocrusts), the underlying soil biotic community, and the belowground
   respiratory activity of C-3 and C-4 grasses over 2 years in southeast
   Utah, USA. We used soil surface CO2 flux and the amount and carbon
   isotope composition (delta C-13) of soil CO2 as indicators of
   belowground and soil surface activity. Soil respiration was always below
   2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and highly responsive to soil moisture. When
   moisture was available, warm spring and summer temperature was
   associated with higher fluxes. Moisture pulses led to enhanced soil
   respiration lasting for a week or more. Biological response to rain was
   not simply dependent on the amount of rain, but also depended on
   antecedent conditions (prior moisture pulses). The short-term
   temperature sensitivity of respiration was very dynamic, showing
   enhancement within 1-2 days of rain, and diminishing each day afterward.
   Carbon uptake occurred by cyanobacterially dominated biocrusts following
   moisture pulses in fall and winter, with a maximal net carbon uptake of
   0.5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), although typically the biocrusts were a net
   carbon source. No difference was detected in the seasonal activity of
   C-3 and C-4 grasses, contrasting with studies from other arid regions
   (where warm-versus cool-season activity is important), and highlighting
   the unique biophysical environment of this cold desert. Contrary to
   other studies, the delta C-13 of belowground respiration in the rooting
   zone of each photosynthetic type did not reflect the delta C-13 of C-3
   and C-4 physiology.}},

Title = {{Herbivore absence can shift dry heath tundra from carbon source to sink
   during peak growing season}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In arctic tundra, large and small mammalian herbivores have substantial
   impacts on the vegetation community and consequently can affect the
   magnitude of carbon cycling. However, herbivores are often absent from
   modern carbon cycle models, partly because relatively few field studies
   focus on herbivore impacts on carbon cycling. Our objectives were to
   quantify the impact of 21 years of large herbivore and large and small
   herbivore exclusion on carbon cycling during peak growing season in a
   dry heath tundra community. When herbivores were excluded, we observed a
   significantly greater leaf area index as well as greater vascular plant
   abundance. While we did not observe significant differences in deciduous
   dwarf shrub abundance across treatments, evergreen dwarf shrub abundance
   was greater where large and small herbivores were excluded. Both foliose
   and fruticose lichen abundance were higher in the large herbivore, but
   not the small and large herbivore exclosures. Net ecosystem exchange
   (NEE) likewise indicated the highest carbon uptake in the exclosure
   treatments and lowest uptake in the control (CT), suggesting that
   herbivory decreased the capacity of dry heath tundra to take up carbon.
   Moreover, our calculated NEE for average light and temperature
   conditions for July 2017, when our measurements were taken, indicated
   that the tundra was a carbon source in CT, but was a carbon sink in both
   exclosure treatments, indicating removal of grazing pressure can change
   the carbon balance of dry heath tundra. Collectively, these findings
   suggest that herbivore absence can lead to changes in plant community
   structure of dry heath tundra that in turn can increase its capacity to
   take up carbon.}},

Abstract = {{In oceanic, nutrient-rich Fermoscandian arctic-alpine tundra heaths,
   grazing by reindeer has been found to increase herbs and graminoids in
   relation to dwarf shrubs. In continental lichen heaths in the inland
   with nutrient-poor conditions, however, slowly decomposable dwarf shrubs
   are favoured by grazing. According to a hypothesis, by favouring easily
   decomposing plants in nutrient-rich conditions and slowly decomposing
   plants in nutrient-poor conditions, herbivory enhances soil nutrient
   cycling in nutrient-rich and retards it in nutrient-poor areas. We
   tested this hypothesis by comparing the impact of reindeer grazing on
   soil C and N mineralization between two oceanic and two continental
   arctic-alpine tundra heaths.
   Although soil respiration and microbial metabolic activity were enhanced
   by grazing in the suboceanic but not in the subcontinental tundra
   heaths, gross N mineralization rates were higher in the grazed areas in
   soils from all study sites, indicating that reindeer grazing leads to
   increased rates of nutrient cycling in both nutrient-poor and
   nutrient-rich tundra heaths. Thus, in the subcontinental tundra heaths,
   the increase in soil N concentrations due to mammalian waste products
   enhances N mineralization rates, even though the organic C quality is
   not improved by reindeer grazing. There was some site-specific variation
   in the strength of the reindeer effects on various microbial processes
   and soil properties, which can be related to spatial variation in
   grazing intensity and timing, as these factors in turn affect the
   nutrient sink strength of the vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Most nitrogen (N) enters many Arctic and Antarctic soil ecosystems as
   protein. Soils in these polar environments frequently contain large
   stocks of proteinaceous organic matter, which has decomposed slowly due
   to low temperatures. In addition to proteins, considerable quantities of
   D-amino acids and their peptides enter soil from bacteria and lengthy
   residence times can lead to racemisation of L-amino acids in stored
   proteins. It has been predicted that climate warming in polar
   environments will lead to increased rates of soil organic N turnover
   (i.e. amino acids and peptides of both enantiomers). However, our
   understanding of organic N breakdown in these soils is very limited. To
   address this, we tested the influence of chain length and enantiomeric
   composition on the rate of breakdown of amino acids and peptides in
   three contrasting tundra soils formed under the grass, moss or
   lichen-dominated primary producer communities of Signy Island in the
   South Orkney Islands. Both D- and L-enantiomers of the amino acid
   monomer were rapidly mineralized to CO2 at rates in line with those
   found for L-amino acids in many other terrestrial ecosystems. In all
   three soils, L-peptides were decomposed faster than their amino acid
   monomer, suggesting a different route of microbial assimilation and
   catabolism. D-peptides followed the same mineralization pattern as
   L-peptides in the two contrasting soils under grass and lichens, but
   underwent relatively slow decomposition in the soil underneath moss,
   which was similar to the soil under the grass. We conclude that the
   decomposition of peptides of L-amino acids may be widely conserved
   amongst soil microorganisms, whereas the decomposition of peptides of
   D-amino acids may be altered by subtle differences between soils. We
   further conclude that intense competition exists in soil microbial
   communities for the capture of both peptides and amino acids produced
   from protein breakdown. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Responses to warming and water-table-lowering simulations of climate

Abstract = {{Midlatitude treed bogs represent significant carbon (C) stocks and are
   highly sensitive to global climate change. In a dry continental treed
   bog, we compared three sites: control, recent (1-3 years; experimental)
   and older drained (10-13 years), with water levels at 38, 74 and 120 cm
   below the surface, respectively. At each site we measured carbon dioxide
   (CO2) fluxes and estimated tree root respiration (R-r; across
   hummock-hollow microtopography of the forest floor) and net primary
   production (NPP) of trees during the growing seasons (May to October) of
   2011-2013. The CO2-C balance was calculated by adding the net CO2
   exchange of the forest floor (NEff-R-r)to the NPP of the trees.
   From cooler and wetter 2011 to the driest and the warmest 2013, the
   control site was a CO2-C sink of 92, 70 and 76 g m(-2), the experimental
   site was a CO2-C source of 14, 57 and 135 g m(-2), and the drained site
   was a progressively smaller source of 26, 23 and 13 g CO2-C m(-2). The
   short-term drainage at the experimental site resulted in small changes
   in vegetation coverage and large net CO2 emissions at the microforms. In
   contrast, the longer-term drainage and deeper water level at the drained
   site resulted in the replacement of mosses with vascular plants (shrubs)
   on the hummocks and lichen in the hollows leading to the highest CO2
   uptake at the drained hummocks and significant losses in the hollows.
   The tree NPP (including above-and below-ground growth and litter fall)
   in 2011 and 2012 was significantly higher at the drained site (92 and 83
   g C m(-2)) than at the experimental (58 and 55 g C m(-2)) and control
   (52 and 46 g C m(-2)) sites.
   We also quantified the impact of climatic warming at all water table
   treatments by equipping additional plots with open-top chambers (OTCs)
   that caused a passive warming on average of similar to 1 degrees C and
   differential air warming of similar to 6 degrees C at midday full sun
   over the study years. Warming significantly enhanced shrub growth and
   the CO2 sink function of the drained hummocks (exceeding the cumulative
   respiration losses in hollows induced by the lowered water level x
   warming). There was an interaction of water level with warming across
   hummocks that resulted in the largest net CO2 uptake at the warmed
   drained hummocks. Thus in 2013, the warming treatment enhanced the sink
   function of the control site by 13 g m(-2), reduced the source function
   of the experimental by 10 g m(-2) and significantly enhanced the sink
   function of the drained site by 73 g m(-2). Therefore, drying and
   warming in continental bogs is expected to initially accelerate CO2-C
   losses via ecosystem respiration, but persistent drought and warming is
   expected to restore the peatland's original CO2-C sink function as a
   result of the shifts in vegetation composition and productivity between
   the microforms and increased NPP of trees over time.}},

Abstract = {{In the course of studies in typical forest ecosystems of the northern,
   middle, and southern taiga of Western Siberia performed at the peak of
   the growing season, the spatial variation of soil CO2 emissions and
   their relationships with the content of extractable and microbial soil

   parameters of the soil carbon cycle are characterized by the high
   spatial variability in all the studied ecosystems. This fact indicates
   the need for a detailed investigation of the greenhouse gas soil
   emission in all ecosystems typical of a given natural zone. There is a
   statistically significant difference between the soils of the green-moss
   pine forests and the soils of the lichen pine forest of the northern
   taiga. In the green-moss pine forest, the carbon content of microbial
   biomass is 1.5 times higher (195 +/- 24 and 127 +/- 16 mg C/kg soil,
   respectively), the content of extractable carbon is 4 times higher (157
   +/- 25 and 41 +/- 5 mg C/kg of soil, respectively), and the CO2 emission
   is 1.7 times higher (324 +/- 20 and 190 +/- 10 mg CO2/(m(2) h),

Abstract = {{The seasonal rhythm of height growth of young shoots of Scots pine
   growing in a 33-year-old shrubby-sphagnum pine forest of the northern
   taiga natural-climatic zone has been studied in a complex with the main
   physiological processes. The possibility of regulating their intensity
   by additional introduction of nitrogen fertilizer has been determined.
   It has been found that on hydromorphic excessively wet soils of the
   North, seasonal height growth of pine occurs with a maximum rate in late
   June and early July, when air temperature rises and the root system is
   released from excessive moisture. Unlike lichen pine forests, in which
   pine roots are not affected by flooding, on hydromorphic peat soils pine
   grows much slower and during the growing season has less intensive
   physiological processes. The low rate of shoot growth and physiological
   processes in pine in sphagnum forest site conditions is explained by
   dysfunction of its root system as a result of soil anoxia caused by
   flooding, as well as by insufficient supply of growing shoots with
   macronutrients from the crown as a result of violation of their normal
   outflow and movement in the tree. Nitrogen fertilizers positively affect
   growth and physiological processes in pine trees in sphagnum forest
   types. However, their effect in these forest site conditions is much
   weaker than in the dry lichen forests of the Far North. On water-logged
   peat soils under the influence of nitrogen fertilizer seasonal height
   growth of pine trees increases by 20 \%, the duration of seasonal shoot
   growth increases by 8-10 days, the intensity of photosynthesis increases
   significantly, and, as a result of reduced water consumption for
   transpiration, the tree water regime normalizes and the transpiration
   productivity increases. These positive nitrogen-induced changes
   ultimately improve the viability and productivity of sphagnum pine
   forests.}},

Abstract = {{The surface of dryland soils is frequently characterised by a biological
   crust comprising of various combinations of cyanobacteria, algae, moss
   and lichens. In the Kalahari of Botswana, soil crusts are predominantly
   made up of cyanobacteria, which when moist, are capable of fixing N and
   C. Many cyanobacteria also produce extracellular polymeric substances
   (EPS) which bind soil particles together and decrease erodibility. The
   physical integrity and metabolic activity of soil crusts is thus
   critical to ecological productivity, erodibility and CO2 fluxes in
   dryland regions. There are, however, few studies of the magnitude and
   controlling factors Of Soil CO2 flux within these systems.
   our aim was to quantify in Situ Soil CO2 flux during contrasting
   antecedent moisture conditions in the south west Kalahari of Botswana.
   We have designed a gas exchange chamber for field deployment coupled to
   a portable gas chromatograph, control and data logging instrumentation.
   The optical and active thermal control specifications of the chamber
   have been designed to permit photosynthesis and cope with the
   temperature extremes of the Kalahari whilst minimizing disturbance to
   the cyanobacteria soil crust. This approach has enabled CO2 fluxes to be
   monitored in situ with a high degree of precision for extended periods.
   In August 2005, when the surface and subsoils were dry, the ambient CO2
   efflux was negative and low during the daytime (-6.15 mg C m(2) h(-1)).
   When 8 mm rainfall equivalent of water was added to the surface there
   was an immediate uptake of CO2 during the daytime at rates up to 75 mg C
   m(2) h(-1) demonstrating that rates of net photosynthesis are greatly
   enhanced by available moisture. In contrast, in May 2006 following a
   prolonged wet period when the subsoil was moist, there was a net
   positive efflux of CO2 from the soil at rates of up to 60 mg C m(2)
   h(-1) irrespective of whether the surface soil was moist or not. This is
   consistent with subsoil heterotrophic bacterial respiration becoming an
   important contributor to soil efflux. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Soil is a significant source of CO2 emission to the atmosphere, and this
   process is accelerating at high latitudes due to rapidly changing
   climates. To investigate the sensitivity of soil CO2 emissions to high
   temporal frequency variations in climate, we performed continuous
   monitoring of soil CO2 efflux using Forced Diffusion (FD) chambers at
   half-hour intervals, across three representative Alaskan soil cover
   types with underlying permafrost. These sites were established during
   the growing season of 2015, on the Seward Peninsula of western Alaska.
   Our chamber system is conceptually similar to a dynamic chamber, though
   FD is more durable and water-resistant and consumes less power, lending
   itself to remote deployments. We first conducted methodological tests,
   testing different frequencies of measurement, and did not observe a
   significant difference between collecting data at 30-min and 10-min
   measurement intervals (averaged half-hourly) (p < 0.001).
   Temperature and thaw depth, meanwhile, are important parameters in
   influencing soil carbon emission. At the study sites, we observed
   cumulative soil CO2 emissions of 62.0, 126.3, and 133.5 gCm(-2) for the
   growing period, in sphagnum, lichen, and tussock, respectively,
   corresponding to 83.8, 63.7, and 79.6\% of annual carbon emissions.
   Growing season soil carbon emissions extrapolated over the region
   equated to 0.17 +/- 0.06 MgC over the measurement period. This was 47\%
   higher than previous estimates from coarse-resolution manual chamber
   sampling, presumably because it better captured high efflux events. This
   finding demonstrates how differences in measurement method and frequency
   can impact interpretations of seasonal and annual soil carbon budgets.
   We conclude that annual CO2 efflux-measurements using FD chamber
   networks would be an effective means for quantifying growing and
   non-growing season soil carbon budgets, with optimal pairing with
   time-lapse imagery for tracking local and regional changes in
   environment and climate in a warming Arctic. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus L.) are the most important large mammalian
   herbivores in Lapland, strongly affecting the dynamics of vegetation by
   grazing and trampling, and this is likely in turn to have consequences
   for the soil processes. We have investigated the changes occurring in
   above-and belowground biomasses, and soil C dynamics (CO2 efflux, soil C
   content, soil microbial biomass) among areas grazed and not grazed by
   reindeer. Our study areas are located in the northern boreal subarctic
   coniferous forest (undisturbed Scots pine {[}Pinus sylvestris L.]
   forests that are naturally lichen-dominated). Our study showed that
   grazing by reindeer decreased the biomass and cover of lichens in the
   area significantly. Also the tree regeneration was affected by grazing,
   as we had much less tree regeneration in the grazed areas. In subarctic
   mature pine forest, grazing did not affect the soil temperature or the
   soil moisture. We found no statistically significant effect of grazing
   on the soil CO2 efflux, soil C stock, and the soil microbial C biomass.
   Soil microbial N biomass was significantly lower in the grazed areas
   compared to the non-grazed areas. Our results indicate that in the

Abstract = {{Chemical analyses for major ions have been conducted on waters,
   collected on an approximately weekly basis over the period April, 1993
   to November, 1996, that drain three small experimental ecosystems
   ({''}sandboxes{''}) at Hubbard Brook, New Hampshire. One sandbox is
   planted with pine trees, another with grass, and the third is left
   ``bare{''} (actually it is covered sporadically by bryophytes and
   lichens). Results show linear correlations, independent of discharge,
   between the concentrations of dissolved Na+ and K+ on the one hand and
   Ca++ and Mg++ on the other for all three sandboxes. No correlations
   between singly charged and doubly charged cations were found. These
   correlations are interpreted to represent cation exchange equilibria
   between soil waters and clay minerals plus soil organic matter. The
   correlation slope, representing the exchange constant, for Na vs K is
   different for the pine-covered sandbox than for the other two whereas
   for Ca vs Mg the correlation is independent of the presence or absence
   of trees. We interpret this as representing a shift of cation exchange
   equilibria in the pine sandbox by the activities of growing trees.
   Concentrations of Na, K, Ca, Mg, and H4SiO4 from the barren and
   grass-lined sandboxes were found to vary seasonally with a marked
   sinusoidal pattern which was independent of the discharge from each
   sandbox. (The discernment of a similar pattern in the tree lined sandbox
   was difficult due to a lack of discharge over much of the year.)
   Concentration maxima occurred in August and minima in February, and
   there is a close parallelism with soil temperature. We interpret this as
   representing temperature induced variations in cation exchange
   equilibria and silica adsorption. Independence from highly varying water
   discharge, e.g.,. that accompanying severe rainstorms, indicates rapidly
   re-attained equilibrium. Variations in the concentrations of cations are
   likely due to exchange with unmeasured cations, probably H+ or dissolved
   Al species, as a result of possible seasonal changes in internal acid
   production and external input of acid rain to the sandboxes. Internal
   production may represent a response to seasonal changes in respiration
   rate as it responds to seasonally varying temperature. Added to this is
   the effect of temperature on exchange equilibrium. Seasonal variations
   in dissolved silica are most likely due to the dependence of
   adsorption/desorption equilibria on temperature. The temperature
   dependence of a number of silica-consuming reactions are consistent with
   the measured values.}},

   maritime Antarctica}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{770}},
Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{Soils can influence climate by sequestering or emitting greenhouse gases
   (GHG) such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide
   (N2O). We are far from understanding the direct influence of cryptogamic
   covers on soil GHG fluxes, particularly in areas free of potential
   anthropogenic confounding factors.
   We assessed the role ofwell-developed cryptogamic covers in soil
   attributes, as well as in the in-situ exchange of GHG between Antarctic
   soils and the atmosphere during the austral summer. We found lower
   values of soil organic matter, total organic carbon, and total nitrogen
   in bare areas than in soils covered by mosses and, particularly,
   lichens. These differences, together with concomitant decreases and
   increases in soil temperature and moisture, respectively, resulted in
   increases in in-situ CO2 emission (i.e. ecosystem respiration) and
   decreases in CH4 uptake but no significant changes in N2O fluxes. We
   found consistent linear positive and negative relationships between soil
   attributes (i.e. soil organic matter, total organic carbon and total
   nitrogen) and CO2 emissions and CH4 uptake, respectively, and polynomial
   relationships between these soil attributes and net N2O fluxes.
   Our results indicate that any increase in the area occupied by
   cryptogams in terrestrial Antarctic ecosystems (due to increased growing
   season and increasingly warming conditions) will likely result in
   parallel increases in soil fertility as well as in an enhanced capacity
   to emit CO2 and a decreased capacity to uptake CH4. Suchchanges, unless
   offset by parallel C uptake processes, would represent a paradigmatic
   example of a positive climate change feedback. Further, we show that the
   fate of these terrestrial ecosystems under future climate scenarios, as
   well as their capacity to exchange GHG with the atmosphere might depend
   on the relative ability of different above-ground cryptogams to thrive
   under the new conditions. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are a common element of the
   Queensland (Australia) dry savannah ecosystem and are composed of
   cyanobacteria, algae, lichens, bryophytes, fungi and heterotrophic
   bacteria. Here we report how the CO2 gas exchange of the
   cyanobacteria-dominated biocrust type from Boodjamulla National Park in
   the north Queensland Gulf Savannah responds to the pronounced climatic
   seasonality and on their quality as a carbon sink using a semi-automatic
   cuvette system. The dominant cyanobacteria are the filamentous species
   Symplocastrum purpurascens together with Scytonema sp. Metabolic
   activity was recorded between 1 July 2010 and 30 June 2011, during which
   CO2 exchange was only evident from November 2010 until mid-April 2011,
   representative of 23.6\% of the 1-year recording period. In November at
   the onset of the wet season, the first month (November) and the last
   month (April) of activity had pronounced respiratory loss of CO2. The
   metabolic active period accounted for 25\% of the wet season and of that
   period 48.6\% was net photosynthesis (NP) and 51.4\% dark respiration
   (DR). During the time of NP, net photosynthetic uptake of CO2 during
   daylight hours was reduced by 32.6\% due to water supersaturation. In
   total, the biocrust fixed 229.09 mmolCO(2) m(-2) yr(-1), corresponding
   to an annual carbon gain of 2.75 gm(-2) yr(-1). Due to malfunction of
   the automatic cuvette system, data from September and October 2010
   together with some days in November and December 2010 could not be
   analysed for NP and DR. Based on climatic and gas exchange data from
   November 2010, an estimated loss of 88 mmolCO(2) m(-2) was found for the
   2 months, resulting in corrected annual rates of 143.1 mmolCO(2) m(-2)
   yr(-1), equivalent to a carbon gain of 1.7 gm(-2) yr(-1). The bulk of
   the net photosynthetic activity occurred above a relative humidity of 42
   \%, indicating a suitable climatic combination of temperature, water
   availability and light intensity well above 200 mu mol photonsm 2 s(-1)
   photosynthetic active radiation. The Boodjamulla biocrust exhibited high
   seasonal variability in CO2 gas exchange pattern, clearly divided into
   metabolically inactive winter months and active summer months. The
   metabolic active period commences with a period of up to 3 months) of
   carbon loss, likely due to reestablishment of the crust structure and
   restoration of NP prior to about a 4-month period of net carbon gain. In
   the Gulf Savannah biocrust system, seasonality over the year
   investigated showed that only a minority of the year is actually
   suitable for biocrust growth and thus has a small window for potential
   contribution to soil organic matter.}},

Abstract = {{During 2 years (2009, 2010), CO2 fluxes were measured in an oligotrophic
   fen located at the ecotonal limit of forest tundra and lichen woodland,
   in northeastern Canada. Peatlands in this region have registered a rise
   in surface moisture since Little Ice Age, allowing an increase in their
   pool size and density. In the studied peatland, 83 \% of the surface is
   covered either with pools (42 \%), hollows (28 \%) and lawns (13 \%) all
   of which present a mean water table higher than 7 cm. We evaluated how
   these conditions might influence the CO2 balance in these poor fens
   located in the northeastern section of the La Grande river watershed.
   During the two years measurements, results indicate a net CO2 source
   with 404 (+/- 287) and 272 (+/- 250) g CO2 m(-2) year(-1) emitted to the
   atmosphere throughout the growing seasons and winters. Modeled
   wintertime net ecosystem exchange resulted in a net loss of 150 (+/- 36)
   and 150 (+/- 37) g CO2 m(-2) year(-1) in 2009 and 2010 respectively,
   while 248 (+/- 248) and 124 (+/- 195) g CO2 m(-2) was emitted during
   2009 and 2010 growing seasons. This high CO2 source can be attributed to
   three factors: (1) the length of the cold season which represented
   210-214 days of net CO2 loss (2) a high pool/vegetated surface ratio
   since pools are a net source of CO2 and presented 38-40 \% of the annual
   spatially weighted CO2 budget and (3) hydroclimatic conditions during
   the growing season as dryer and warmer conditions in 2009 reduced
   photosynthesis and increased respiration rates.}},

Abstract = {{Northern peatlands hold large amounts of organic carbon (C) in their
   soils and are as such important in a climate change context. Blanket
   bogs, i.e. nutrient-poor peatlands restricted to maritime climates, may
   be extra vulnerable to global warming since they require a positive
   water balance to sustain their moss dominated vegetation and C sink
   functioning. This study presents a 4.5 year record of land-atmosphere
   carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange from the Andoya blanket bog in northern
   Norway. Compared with other peatlands, the Andoya peatland exhibited low
   flux rates, related to the low productivity of the dominating moss and
   lichen communities and the maritime settings that attenuated seasonal
   temperature variations. It was observed that under periods of high
   vapour pressure deficit, net ecosystem exchange was reduced, which was
   mainly caused by a decrease in gross primary production. However, no
   persistent effects of dry conditions on the CO2 exchange dynamics were
   observed, indicating that under present conditions and within the range
   of observed meteorological conditions the Andoya blanket bog retained
   its C uptake function. Continued monitoring of these ecosystem types is
   essential in order to detect possible effects of a changing climate.}},

   distribution patterns of tropical bryophytes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BRYOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{47-56}},
Abstract = {{Bryophyte biomass and diversity vary strongly with altitude in the
   tropics. Low abundance and low species numbers in lowland rain forests
   are most likely due to reduced diurnal activity times combined with high
   nocturnal respiration rates at high temperatures. This may exclude many
   montane species from the warm lowlands. However, an alternative
   hypothesis explains the observed pattern, namely a limited desiccation
   tolerance of montane species, precipitation being more concentrated but
   less frequent in most lowland forests compared to montane cloud forests.
   To test this hypothesis, we studied the desiccation tolerance of four
   montane and four lowland bryophyte species. The effects of prolonged
   drought were quantified with chlorophyll fluorescence (F-v/F-m) and the
   extent of electrolyte leakage. Both montane and lowland species survived
   dry periods of >= 80 days, which far exceeds the duration of dry periods
   in the wet lowland tropics. We can thus exclude intolerance to long dry
   spells as an explaination for the absence of the tested montane species
   in the lowlands. We should continue to focus on other mechanisms to
   explain the altitudinal gradient of bryophyte abundance and diversity in
   the tropics, in order to understand this pattern, as well as to predict
   future trends under climatic warming.}},

Abstract = {{Climate warming exhibits asymmetric patterns over a diel time, with the
   trend of nighttime warming exceeding that of daytime warming, a
   phenomenon commonly known as asymmetric warming. Recently, increasing
   studies have documented the significant instantaneous impacts of
   asymmetric warming on terrestrial vegetation growth, but the indirect
   effects of asymmetric warming carrying over vegetation growth (referred
   to here as time-lag effects) remain unknown. Here, we quantitatively
   studied the time-lag effects (within 1 year) of asymmetric warming on
   global plant biomes by using terrestrial vegetation net primary
   production (NPP) derived by the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA)
   model and accumulated daytime and nighttime temperature (ATmax and
   ATmin) from 1982 to 2013. Partial correlation and time-lag analyses were
   conducted at a monthly scale to obtain the partial correlation
   coefficients between NPP and ATmax/ATmin and the lagged durations of NPP
   responses to ATmax/ATmin. The results showed that (i) asymmetric warming
   has nonuniform time-lag effects on single plant biomes, and
   distinguishing correlations exist in different vegetation biomes'
   associations to asymmetric warming; (ii) terrestrial biomes respond to
   ATmax (4.63 +/- 3.92 months) with a shorter protracted duration than to
   ATmin (6.06 +/- 4.27 months); (iii) forest biomes exhibit longer
   prolonged duration in responding to asymmetric warming than nonforest
   biomes do; (iv) mosses and lichens (Mosses), evergreen needleleaf
   forests (ENF), deciduous needleleaf forests (DNF), and mixed forests
   (MF) tend to positively correlate with ATmax, whereas the other biomes
   associate with ATmax with near-equal splits of positive and negative
   correlation; and (v) ATmin has a predominantly positive influence on
   terrestrial biomes, except for Mosses and DNF. This study provides a new
   perspective on terrestrial ecosystem responses to asymmetric warming and
   highlights the importance of including such nonuniform time-lag effects
   into currently used terrestrial ecosystem models during future
   investigations of vegetation-climate interactions.}},

Title = {{CO2 efflux from the biological soil crusts of the High Arctic in a later

   Norway}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{The CO2 efflux from representative tundra ecosystems in the high Arctic
   should be monitored in order to evaluate the potential future
   sensitivity of the carbon cycle to climate change. However, studies on
   the soil CO2 efflux from them are still limited, especially deglaciated
   area due to the Arctic warming. The ecosystem in Ny-Alesund, Svalbard,
   Norway (similar to 79 degrees N) has gradually undergone substantial
   alterations due to deglaciation induced by climate change, where
   biological soil crusts (BSCs, mainly consisting of cyanobacteria, algae,
   lichen, and bryophytes, etc. on the soil surface) are widely formed in
   the glacier foreland and further developed especially in the later
   stages of primary succession. In this study, soil CO2 efflux from partly
   or totally covered with black-colored BSCs (BSCs-B) was measured from
   2007 to 2009 using portable dynamic chamber system. The objectives of
   this study were (i) to quantify the CO2 efflux from the soil, (ii) to
   examine the controlling factors which affect the temporal and spatial
   variation of soil CO2 efflux, (iii) to examine the contribution of
   BSCs-B to soil CO2 efflux, and (iv) to estimate the relationship between
   soil CO2 efflux and microbial activity to evaluate its role on the
   surface carbon budget at deglaciated area. It was found that the
   emission of soil CO2 from BSCs-B was consistent through the long-term in
   situ measurement in the high arctic tundra. Soil CO2 efflux ranged from
   0.3 to 0.7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) with means of 0.56 (+/- 0.07) mu mol m(-2)
   s(-1) in 2007, 0.54 (+/- 0.13) mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in 2008, and 0.51 (+/-
   0.09) mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in 2009. The soil temperature (Ts) explained
   50-70\% of the temporal variation of the soil CO2 efflux when
   temperature ranged from 6 to 12 degrees C, whereas Ts is not controlling
   factor for spatial variation of soil CO2 efflux considering the low
   coefficient of variation (CV). In the meanwhile, soil water content
   (SWC) was not a main controlling factor for temporal variation of soil
   CO2 efflux. Even though CV of SWC was not low, spatial variation of SWC
   could not explain that of soil CO2 efflux. The soil CO2 efflux was
   spatially affected by BSCs-B coverage, amount of pebble, and the nearby
   vegetation distribution. All enzyme activities exhibited significantly
   higher values in BSCs-B than in mineral soil of BSCs (p<0.01). The
   activities of enzymes in BSCs-B generally exhibited positive
   correlations with the soil CO2 efflux except for humic substances
   (R-2=0.52). It can be concluded that the magnitude of the soil CO2
   efflux from BSCs-B is comparable to those from moss and vascular plants
   in the surface carbon budget. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Ecophysiological characterizations of photoautotrophic communities are
   not only necessary to identify the response of carbon fixation related
   to different climatic factors, but also to evaluate risks connected to
   changing environments. In biological soil crusts (BSCs), the description
   of ecophysiological features is difficult, due to the high variability
   in taxonomic composition and variable methodologies applied. Especially
   for BSCs in early successional stages, the available datasets are rare
   or focused on individual constituents, although these crusts may
   represent the only photoautotrophic component in many heavily disturbed
   ruderal areas, such as parking lots or building areas with increasing
   surface area worldwide. We analyzed the response of photosynthesis and
   respiration to changing BSC water contents (WCs), temperature and light
   in two early successional BSCs. We investigated whether the response of
   these parameters was different between intact BSC and the isolated
   dominating components. BSCs dominated by the cyanobacterium Nostoc
   commune and dominated by the green alga Zygogonium ericetorum were
   examined. A major divergence between the two BSCs was their absolute
   carbon fixation rate on a chlorophyll basis, which was significantly
   higher for the cyanobacterial crust. Nevertheless, independent of
   species composition, both crust types and their isolated organisms had
   convergent features such as high light acclimatization and a minor and
   very late-occurring depression in carbon uptake at water
   suprasaturation. This particular setup of ecophysiological features may
   enable these communities to cope with a high variety of climatic
   stresses and may therefore be a reason for their success in heavily
   disturbed areas with ongoing human impact. However, the shape of the
   response was different for intact BSC compared to separated organ-isms,
   especially in absolute net photosynthesis (NP) rates. This emphasizes
   the importance of measuring intact BSCs under natural conditions for
   collecting reliable data for meaningful analysis of BSC ecosystem
   services.}},

   to climate change is largely unknown. Using plants and biological soil
   crusts, we tested the relative importance of facilitative-competitive
   interactions and other community attributes (cover, species richness and
   species evenness) as drivers of ecosystem functioning along stress
   gradients in semi-arid Mediterranean ecosystems. Biotic interactions
   shifted from facilitation to competition along stress gradients driven
   by water availability and temperature. These changes were, however,
   dependent on the spatial scale and the community considered. We found
   little evidence to suggest that biotic interactions are a major direct
   influence upon indicators of ecosystem functioning (soil respiration,
   organic carbon, water-holding capacity, compaction and the activity of
   enzymes related to the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles) along
   stress gradients. However, attributes such as cover and species richness
   showed a direct effect on ecosystem functioning. Our results do not
   agree with predictions emphasizing that the importance of plant-plant
   interactions will be increased under climate change in dry environments,
   and indicate that reductions in the cover of plant and biological soil
   crust communities will negatively impact ecosystems under future
   climatic conditions.}},

Title = {{Photosynthesis of cryptobiotic soil crusts in a seasonally inundated

Abstract = {{Cryptobiotic soil crusts form the dominant cover of a unique system of
   dunes and intermittently inundated pans and playas situated on the
   Pleistocene Lake Thompson bed, in the western Mojave Desert, CA. Recent
   work has reported on basic ecological parameters including distribution,
   abundance, and species composition of these algal
   (cyanobacterial)dominated crusts as well as on their photosynthetic
   rates in laboratory studies. As a step toward building an ecological
   model for a natural resource management plan, we determined the
   photosynthetic rate of the crusts under field environmental conditions.
   We examined the relationship between the environmental conditions of
   crust moisture content (MC), temperature, and ambient CO? concentration
   on photosynthetic rates during the mid-spring and the late autumn.
   Maximal photosynthetic rates (P-max), which did not vary greatly with
   season, were 3.57 and 3.99 mu mol CO2 M-2 s(-1) for crusts on dunes and
   in pans, respectively. Mean photosynthetic rates for three types of
   crust on dunes, smooth and flat, pedicillated, and unconsolidated, were
   1.31, 1.47, and 1.29 mu mol CO2 M-2 s(-1), respectively. P-max of crusts
   on dunes and pans occurred at soil MCs of 110\% and 20\%, respectively,
   both lower and higher MCs resulted in decreased rates of photosynthesis.
   The relation between atmospheric CO2 concentration and net
   photosynthesis was linear (r(2) = 0.88 and 0.97 for crusts on dunes and
   pans, respectively) through at least 1000ppm CO2, We measured positive
   net photosynthesis at temperatures from 0 to 46 degrees C and found no
   clear optimum within this range when crusts were provided with optimal
   moisture and light conditions. Photosynthetic rates in this field study
   were somewhat lower than those measured in the laboratory, but both
   optimum MC and the relation between ambient CO2 and net photosynthetic
   rate were similar. Respiration rates were generally less than 10\% those
   of photosynthetic rates. Based on data herein and climatic information,
   we estimated the potential net primary productivity of crusts on dunes
   to be 11.7g Cm-2 yr(-1). The photosynthetic rate of the unconsolidated
   crust type, for which no data have been published, was similar to the
   other crust types. This finding, together with previous information that
   the chlorophyll values of this and other crust forms were similar,
   suggests that ecological studies, as well as conservation and
   restoration efforts, give these the same attention as the other crust
   types. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the Amazonian rain forest, major parts of trees and shrubs are
   covered by epiphytic cryptogams of great taxonomic variety, but their
   relevance in biosphere-atmosphere exchange, climate processes, and
   nutrient cycling is largely unknown. As cryptogams are poikilohydric
   organisms, they are physiologically active only under moist conditions.
   Thus, information on their water content (WC) as well as temperature and
   light conditions experienced by them are essential to analyze their
   impact on local, regional, and even global biogeochemical processes. In
   this study, we present data on the microclimatic conditions, including
   water content, temperature, and light conditions experienced by
   epiphytic bryophytes along a vertical gradient, and combine these with
   above-canopy climate data collected at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory
   (ATTO) in the Amazonian rain forest between October 2014 and December
   2016. While the monthly average of above-canopy light intensities
   revealed only minor fluctuations over the course of the year, the light
   intensities experienced by the bryophytes varied depending on the
   location within the canopy, probably caused by individual shading by
   vegetation. In the understory (1.5 m), monthly average light intensities
   were similar throughout the year, and individual values were extremely
   low, remaining below 3 mu mol(-1) m(-2) s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux
   density more than 84 \% of the time. Temperatures showed only minor
   variations throughout the year, with higher values and larger
   height-dependent differences during the dry season. The indirectly
   assessed water content of bryophytes varied depending on precipitation,
   air humidity, dew condensation, and bryophyte type. Whereas bryophytes
   in the canopy were affected by diel fluctuations of the relative
   humidity and condensation, those close to the forest floor mainly
   responded to rainfall patterns. In general, bryophytes growing close to
   the forest floor were limited by light availability, while those growing
   in the canopy had to withstand larger variations in microclimatic
   conditions, especially during the dry season. For further research in
   this field, these data may be combined with CO2 gas exchange
   measurements to investigate the role of bryophytes in various
   biosphere-atmosphere exchange processes, and could be a tool to
   understand the functioning of the epiphytic community in greater detail.}},

Abstract = {{Multidrug resistance (MDR) is the main cause of chemotherapy failure,
   and the mechanism of MDR is largely associated with drug efflux mediated
   by the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporters.
   Herein, an NIR-light-triggered CO release system based on mesoporous
   Prussian blue nanoparticles (PB NPs) was developed to reverse MDR via
   CO-induced metabolic exhaustion. Penta-carbonyl iron (Fe(CO)(5)) as the
   CO producer was coupled to PB NPs via coordination interaction, and
   doxorubicin (Dox) was encapsulated into the pores of PB NPs. After
   layer-by-layer (LBL) coating, the NPs showed desired serum stability to
   enhance tumor accumulation. Upon tumor-site-specific NIR light (808 nm)
   irradiation, the nonlethal temperature elevation cleaved the Fe-CO bond
   to release CO. CO then expedited mitochondrial metabolic exhaustion to
   block ATP synthesis and inhibit ATP-dependent drug efflux, thus
   reversing MDR of the Dox-resistant MCF-7/ADR tumors to potentiate the
   anticancer efficacy of Dox. In the meantime, CO-mediated mitochondrial
   exhaustion could upregulate the proapoptotic protein, caspase 3, thus
   inducing cellular apoptosis and enabling a synergistic anticancer effect
   with chemotherapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time
   MDR has been overcome using a CO delivery system. This study provides a
   promising strategy to realize an effective and safe treatment against
   MDR tumors and reveals new insights in the use of CO for cancer
   treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Droppings of Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) could
   affect the carbon and nitrogen cycles in tundra ecosystems. The aim of
   this study was to evaluate the potential of reindeer droppings
   originating from the winter diet for emission and/or absorption of
   methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in summer. An incubation
   experiment was conducted over 14 days using reindeer droppings and
   mineral subsoil collected from a mound near Ny-Alesund, Svalbard, to
   determine the potential exchanges of CH4 and N2O for combinations of two
   factors, reindeer droppings (presence or absence) and soil moisture
   (dry, moderate, or wet). A line transect survey was conducted to
   determine the distribution density of winter droppings at the study
   site. The incubation experiment showed a weak absorption of CH4 and a
   weak emission of N2O. Reindeer droppings originating from the winter
   diet had a negligible effect on the exchange fluxes of both CH4 and N2O.
   Although the presence of droppings resulted in a short-lasting increase
   in N2O emissions on day 1 (24 h from the start) for moderate and wet
   conditions, the emission rates were still very small, up to 3 mu g N2O
   m(-2) h(-1). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Arctic terrestrial ecosystem is thought to be extremely susceptible
   to climate change. However, because of the diverse responses of
   ecosystem components to change. an overall response of the ecosystem

   in the high Arctic. Vegetation cover and soil carbon pools tended to
   increase with the progress of succession. However, even in the latter
   stages of succession, the size of the soil carbon pool was much smaller
   than those reported for the low Arctic tundra. Cryptogams contributed
   the major proportion of phytomass in the later stages. However, because
   of water limitation, their net primary production was smaller than that
   of the vascular plants. The compartment model that incorporated major
   carbon pools and flows suggested that the ecosystem of the later stages
   is likely to be a net sink of carbon at least for the summer season.
   Based on the eco-physiological characteristics of the major ecosystem

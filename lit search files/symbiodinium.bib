Abstract = {Coral reefs are dominated by symbioses between marine invertebrates
   (e.g. corals, clams, sea anemones, sponges) and the dinoflagellate
   Symbiodinium. Increases in seawater temperature linked to global warming
   have lead to the phenomenon known as ``bleaching{''}, involving the
   disassociation of these symbioses and mass mortalities of the
   invertebrate host. Mass bleaching events have been linked to a thermal
   lesion in the photosynthesis of Symbiodinium, either at photosystem II
   or in the dark reactions of photosynthesis. Examination of two of the
   proposed lesion points, the carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM) and
   form II Rubisco, indicate that, over the temperature range examined, the
   CCM is not disrupted in Symbiodinium isolated from giant clams, however
   it was not possible to determine if Rubisco is the point of thermal
   lesion resulting in bleaching. Maximum photosynthetic rates were
   measured between 28 and 31degreesC and declined as temperature was
   increased. Despite a low correlation between Rubisco activity, oxygen
   evolution and temperature, Rubisco activity declined with increasing
   temperature.},

Title = {Carbonic anhydrase activity changes in response to increased temperature
   and <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> in <i>Symbiodinium</i>-zoanthid associations},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) makes up less than 1\% of dissolved inorganic
   carbon (DIC) in the ocean. To acquire carbon dioxide for photosynthesis,
   many marine autotrophs rely on the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) to
   catalyze the conversion of bicarbonate ions, (HCO3-) to CO2. In
   zoanthids and other cnidarians with Symbiodinium spp. endosymbionts, CA
   is essential for transporting CO2 to symbionts for photosynthesis.
   Temperature and ambient DIC affect CA activity, therefore, increased sea
   water temperatures and ocean acidification (OA) will alter CO2 transport
   in symbiotic cnidarians. However, these effects are likely to be species
   specific for both host and symbiont, as different cnidarians and
   Symbiodinium spp. vary in their mechanisms of DIC transport and
   utilization of CA. In this study, host and symbiont CA activity in the
   zoanthids Palythoa sp. and Zoanthus sp. varied with thermal stress and
   low pH. Increased temperature inhibited algal, but not host CA activity
   in Zoanthus sp. polyps with A4 Symbiodinium, while temperature had no
   effect on CA activity in Palythoa sp. with Cl Symbiodinium. High
   pCO(2)/low pH altered algal CA activity in both zoanthid species, but
   host CA activity changed in Zoanthus sp. polyps only. This study shows
   that thermal stress and OA induce species-specific changes in CA
   activity, and thus DIC transport in symbiotic zoanthids. These
   observations suggest that CA activity in symbiotic cnidarians will be
   altered by climate conditions predicted for the future, and for some
   cnidarians, changes in CA activity may inhibit photosynthesis. (C) 2015

Abstract = {Increasing sea-surface temperatures and ocean acidification (OA) are
   impacting physiologic processes in a variety of marine organisms. Many
   sea anemones, corals and jellies in the phylum Cnidaria form
   endosymbiotic relationships with Symbiodinium spp. (phylum
   Dinoflagellata) supply the hosts with fixed carbon from photosynthesis.
   Much work has focused on the generally negative effects of rising
   temperature and OA on calcification in Symbiodinium-coral symbioses, but
   has not directly measured symbiont photosynthesis in hospite or fixed
   carbon translocation from symbiont to host. Symbiodinium species or
   types vary in their environmental tolerance and photosynthetic capacity;
   therefore, primary production in symbiotic associations can vary with
   symbiont type. However, symbiont type has not been identified in a large
   portion of Symbiodinium-cnidarian studies. Future climate conditions and
   OA may favor non-calcifying, soft-bodied cnidarians, including
   zoanthids. Here we show that two zoanthid species, Palythoa sp. and
   Zoanthus sp., harboring different symbiont types (C1 and A4), had very
   different responses to increased temperature and increased partial
   pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)), or dissolved CO2, and low pH. Thermal stress
   did not affect carbon fixation or fixed carbon translocation in the
   Zoanthus sp./A4 association, and high pCO(2)/low pH increased carbon
   fixation. In contrast, both thermal stress and high pCO(2)/low pH
   greatly inhibited carbon fixation in the Palythoa sp./C1 association.
   However, the combined treatment of high temperature and high pCO(2)
   increased carbon fixation relative to the treatment of high temperature
   alone. Our observations support the growing body of evidence that
   demonstrates that the response of symbiotic cnidarians to thermal stress
   and OA must be considered on a host-specific and symbiont-specific
   basis. In addition, we show that the effects of increased temperature
   and pCO(2) on photosynthesis may change when these two stressors are
   combined. Understanding how carbon fixation and translocation varies
   among different host-symbiont combinations is critical to predicting
   which Symbiodinium associations may persist in warm, acidified oceans.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {2},
Month = {JUL 26},
Abstract = {Circadian rhythms, which are found in most eukaryotes, are defined as
   rhythms that persist under constant conditions with a periodicity close
   to 24 h. One central key characteristic of all circadian rhythms is
   ``temperature compensation{''}, which allows organisms to maintain
   robust rhythms with a period close to a diel cycle over a broad range of
   physiological temperatures. To better understand the response of the
   circadian clock in corals to temperature elevation, photosynthesis as an
   output process of the circadian clock was studied both in Stylophora
   pistillata corals and in cultured Symbiodinium algae. The time period of
   photosynthesis was not affected by temperature elevation in the cultured
   algae or in the corals harbouring Symbiodinium. However, the
   photosynthetic system responded to temperature elevations by adjusting
   the photosynthetic apparatus. These findings suggest that the endogenous
   algal circadian clock regulates the photosynthetic rhythm and
   compensates for temperature elevations that occur in the natural
   environment.},

Abstract = {Increases in seawater temperature impair photosynthesis
   (photoinhibition) in the symbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium within
   cnidarian hosts, such as corals and sea anemones, and may destroy their
   symbiotic relationship. Although the degree of photoinhibition in
   Symbiodinium under heat stress differs among strains, the differences in
   their responses to increased temperatures, including cyclic electron
   flow (CEF), which sustains photoprotective thermal energy dissipation,
   have not been investigated. Here, we examined CEF in cultured
   Symbiodinium cells or those in an endosymbiotic relationship within a
   cnidarian host. The light-dependent reduction of the primary electron
   donor photosystem I, i.e. P700(+), was enhanced in any Symbiodinium cell
   by increasing temperatures, indicating CEF was induced by heat, which
   was accompanied by thermal energy dissipation activation. The critical
   temperatures for inducing CEF were different among Symbiodinium strains.
   The clade A strains with greater susceptibility to photoinhibition,
   OTcH-1 and Y106, exhibited higher CEF activities under moderate heat
   stress than a more phototolerant clade B strain Mf1.05b, suggesting that
   the observed CEF induction was not a preventive measure but a stress
   response in Symbiodinium.},

Abstract = {Coral bleaching, the loss of symbiotic dinoflagellate algae (genus
   Symbiodinium) and/or photosynthetic algal pigments from corals, is
   thought to be primarily triggered by the thermal dysfunction of
   photosynthesis and a consequent build-up of reactive oxygen species.
   However, different corals exhibit differential bleaching
   susceptibilities, perhaps resulting from dissimilar abilities to deal
   with oxidative stress. We therefore tested whether thermal sensitivity
   in Symbiodinium is correlated with the capacity to deal with oxidative
   stress, by comparing the effects of increased temperature and hydrogen
   peroxide (H2O2) concentration on the photosynthetic performance of four
   cultured Symbiodinium ITS2 types (A1, B2, E, and F1) and two freshly
   isolated Symbiodinium ITS2 types (a temperate A-type and B1). Generally,
   the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (F (v)/F (m)) declined in
   Symbiodinium with both increasing thermal and oxidative stress. However,
   not all types followed this pattern. Cultured Symbiodinium A1 showed a
   strong negative response to elevated temperature but little response to
   the addition of H2O2, while cultured F1 showed an increase in F (v)/F
   (m) at elevated temperature but a decline in this parameter to almost
   zero at high H2O2 concentrations. Furthermore, both freshly isolated
   Symbiodinium types appeared to be relatively stress tolerant, with the
   temperate A-type showing an especially high resistance to both
   stressors. In conclusion, a range of Symbiodinium types were shown to
   differ in their susceptibilities to both thermal and oxidative stress,
   though in contrast to our original hypothesis, sensitivity to oxidative
   stress did not necessarily predict thermal sensitivity (or vice versa).},

Abstract = {Coral reefs of the Florida Keys typically experience seasonal
   temperatures of 20-31 degrees C. Deviation outside this range causes
   physiological impairment of reef-building corals, potentially leading to
   coral colony death. In January and February 2010, two closely spaced
   cold fronts, possibly driven by an unusually extreme Arctic Oscillation,
   caused sudden and severe seawater temperature declines in the Florida
   Keys. Inshore coral reefs {[}e. g., Admiral Reef (ADM)] experienced
   lower sustained temperatures (i.e., < 12 degrees C) than those further
   offshore {[}e. g., Little Grecian Reef (LG), minimum temperature = 17.2
   degrees C]. During February and March 2010, we surveyed ADM and observed
   a mass die-off of reef-building corals, whereas 12 km away LG did not
   exhibit coral mortality. We subsequently measured the physiological
   effects of low-temperature stress on three common reef-building corals
   (i.e., Montastraea faveolata, Porites astreoides, and Siderastrea
   siderea) over a range of temperatures that replicated the inshore
   cold-water anomaly (i.e., from 20 to 16 to 12 degrees C and back to 20
   degrees C). Throughout the temperature modulations, coral respiration as
   well as endosymbiont gross photosynthesis and maximum quantum efficiency
   of photosystem II were measured. In addition, Symbiodinium genotypic
   identity, cell densities, and chlorophyll a content were determined at
   the beginning and conclusion of the experiment. All corals were
   significantly affected at 12 degrees C, but species-specific
   physiological responses were found indicating different coral and/or
   Symbiodinium cold tolerances. Montastraea faveolata and P. astreoides
   appeared to be most negatively impacted because, upon return to 20
   degrees C, significant reductions in gross photosynthesis and dark
   respiration persisted. Siderastrea siderea, however, readily recovered
   to pre-treatment rates of dark respiration and gross photosynthesis.
   Visual surveys of inshore reefs corroborated these results, with S.
   siderea being minimally affected by the cold-water anomaly, whereas M.
   faveolata and P. astreoides exhibited nearly 100\% mortality. This study
   highlights the importance of understanding the physiological attributes
   of genotypically distinct coral-Symbiodinium symbioses that contribute
   to tolerance, recovery, and consequences to an environmental
   perturbation. These data also document effects of a rarely studied
   environmental stressor, possibly initiated by remote global climate
   events, on coral-Symbiodinium symbioses and coral reef communities.},

Abstract = {High sea surface temperature accompanied by high levels of solar
   irradiance is responsible for the disruption of the symbiosis between
   cnidarians and their symbiotic dinoflagellates from the genus
   Symbiodinium. This phenomenon, known as coral bleaching, is one of the
   major threats affecting coral reefs around the world. Because an
   important molecular trigger to bleaching appears related to the
   production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), it is critical to
   understand the function of the antioxidant network of Symbiodinium
   species. In this study we investigated the response of two Symbiodinium
   species, from contrasting environments, to a chemically induced
   oxidative stress. ROS produced during this oxidative burst reduced
   photosynthesis by 30 to 50\% and significantly decreased the activity of
   superoxide dismutase. Lipid peroxidation levels and carotenoid
   concentrations, especially diatoxanthin, confirm that these molecules
   act as antioxidants and contribute to the stabilization of membrane
   lipids. The comparative analysis between the two Symbiodinium species
   allowed us to highlight that Symbiodinium sp. clade A temperate was more
   tolerant to oxidative stress than the tropical S. kawagutii clade F.
   These differences are very likely a consequence of adaptation to their
   natural environment, with the temperate species experiencing conditions
   of temperature and irradiance much more variable and extreme.},

Abstract = {Occurrences whereby cnidaria lose their symbiotic dinoflagellate
   microalgae (Symbiodinium spp.) are increasing in frequency and
   intensity. These so-called bleaching events are most often related to an
   increase in water temperature, which is thought to limit certain
   Symbiodinium phylotypes from effectively dissipating absorbed excitation
   energy that is otherwise used for photochemistry. Here, we examined
   photosynthetic characteristics and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production,
   a possible signal involved in bleaching, from two Symbiodinium types (a
   thermally ``tolerant{''} A1 and ``sensitive{''} B1) representative of
   cnidaria-Symbiodinium symbioses of reef-building Caribbean corals. Under
   steady-state growth at 26 degrees C, a higher efficiency of PSII
   photochemistry, rate of electron turnover, and rate of O-2 production
   were observed for type A1 than for B1. The two types responded very
   differently to a period of elevated temperature (32 degrees C): type A1
   increased light-driven O-2 consumption but not the amount of H2O2
   produced; in contrast, type B1 increased the amount of H2O2 produced
   without an increase in light-driven O-2 consumption. Therefore, our
   results are consistent with previous suggestions that the thermal
   tolerance of Symbiodinium is related to adaptive constraints associated
   with photosynthesis and that sensitive phylotypes are more prone to H2O2
   production. Understanding these adaptive differences in the genus
   Symbiodinium will be crucial if we are to interpret the response of
   symbiotic associations, including reef-building corals, to environmental
   change.},

Abstract = {Dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium, the endosymbiont of reef
   corals, play an important role in coral-bleaching events which can be
   induced by prolonged enhanced seawater temperature anomalies, and which
   are predicted to occur at increasing frequencies and severities due to
   global warming. The genus Symbiodinium exhibits high genetic diversity
   with physiological variation within and among species, leading to a
   range of thermal tolerance. Although these variations have been examined
   in individual species, comprehensive comparative experimental data
   across several species are still rare. Therefore, in the present study,
   the photophysiological and thermal response patterns of six genetically
   characterized Symbiodinium genotypes were comparatively investigated.
   The six Symbiodinium genotypes were isolated from four different host
   species from the following biogeographic locations: Hawaii (Central
   Pacific), Panama (Caribbean), Florida (Caribbean), and Palau (West
   Pacific). Photosynthesis-irradiance curve and growth measurements at
   temperatures ranging from 20 to 33 A degrees C were carried out. All
   physiological data clearly indicate significant differences in the
   response patterns of the six Symbiodinium genotypes. While some types
   photosynthesized, respired, and grew at 33 A degrees C, others showed a
   partial or complete inhibition. The genotype-specific response over the
   experimental temperature reveals the potential range response of a given
   symbiont and variation between strains that adaptation might act upon.},

Abstract = {Disentangling the metabolic functioning of corals' endosymbionts
   (Symbiodiniaceae) is relevant to understanding the response of coral
   reefs to warming oceans. In this work, we first question whether there
   is an energetic coupling between photosynthesis and respiration in
   Symbiodiniaceae (Symbiodinium,DurusdiniumandEffrenium), and second, how
   different levels of energetic coupling will affect their adaptive
   responses to global warming. Coupling between photosynthesis and
   respiration was established by determining the variation of metabolic
   rates during thermal response curves, and how inhibition of respiration
   affects photosynthesis. Adaptive (irreversible) responses were studied
   by exposing twoSymbiodiniumspecies with different levels of
   photosynthesis-respiration interaction to high temperature conditions
   (32 degrees C) for 1 yr. We found that some Symbiodiniaceae have a high
   level of energetic coupling; that is, photosynthesis and respiration
   have the same temperature dependency, and photosynthesis is negatively
   affected when respiration is inhibited. Conversely, photosynthesis and
   respiration are not coupled in other species. In any case, prolonged
   exposure to high temperature caused adjustments in both photosynthesis
   and respiration, but these changes were fully reversible. We conclude
   that energetic coupling between photosynthesis and respiration exhibits
   wide variation amongst Symbiodiniaceae and does not determine the
   occurrence of adaptive responses in Symbiodiniaceae to temperature
   increase.},

Abstract = {The symbiosis between hermatypic corals and their dinoflagellate
   endosymbionts, genus Symbiodinium, is based on carbon exchange. This
   symbiosis is disrupted by thermally induced coral bleaching, a stress
   response in which the coral host expels its algal symbionts as they
   become physiologically impaired. The disruption of the dissolved
   inorganic carbon (DIC) supply or the thermal inactivation of Rubisco
   have been proposed as sites of initial thermal damage that leads to the
   bleaching response. Symbiodinium possesses a highly unusual Form II
   ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), which exhibits a
   lower CO2:O-2 specificity and may be more thermally unstable than the
   Form I Rubiscos of other algae and land plants. Components of the CO2
   concentrating mechanism (CCM), which supplies inorganic carbon for
   photosynthesis, may also be temperature sensitive. Here, we examine the
   ability of four cultured Symbiodinium strains to acquire and fix DIC
   across a temperature gradient. Surprisingly, the half-saturation
   constant of photosynthesis with respect to DIC concentration (K (P)), an
   index of CCM function, declined with increasing temperature in three of
   the four strains, indicating a greater potential for photosynthetic
   carbon acquisition at elevated temperatures. In the fourth strain, there
   was no effect of temperature on K (P). Finding no evidence for thermal
   inhibition of the CCM, we conclude that CCM components are not likely to
   be the primary sites of thermal damage. Reduced photosynthetic quantum
   yields, a hallmark of thermal bleaching, were observed at low DIC
   concentrations, leaving open the possibility that reduced inorganic
   carbon availability is involved in bleaching.},

Abstract = {The association between cnidarians and photosynthetic dinoflagellates
   within the genus Symbiodinium is a prevalent relationship in tropical
   and subtropical marine environments. Although the diversity of
   Symbiodinium provides a possible axis for niche diversification,
   increased functional range and resilience to physical stressors such as
   elevated temperature, how such diversity relates to the physiological
   balance between autotrophy and heterotrophy of the host animal remains
   unknown. Here, we experimentally show interspecific and intraspecific
   variability of photosynthetic carbon fixation and subsequent
   translocation by Symbiodinium to the model cnidarian host Aiptasia
   pallida. By using a clonal anemone line harboring different species of
   Symbiodinium, we determined that symbiont identity influences trophic
   plasticity through its density, capacity to fix carbon, quantity of
   translocated carbon and ultimately the host's capacity to ingest and
   digest prey. Symbiont carbon translocation and host prey ingestion were
   positively correlated across symbiont combinations that consisted of
   different isoclonal lines of Symbiodinium minutum, while a combination
   with type D4-5 Symbiodinium displayed lower carbon translocation, and
   prey capture and digestion more similar to Aiptasia lacking symbionts.
   The absence of a shift toward greater heterotrophy when carbon
   translocation is low suggests that the metabolic demand of feeding and
   digestion may overwhelm nutritional stores when photosynthesis is
   reduced, and amends the possible role of animal feeding in resistance to
   or recovery from the effects of climate change in more obligate
   symbioses such as reef-building corals.},

Abstract = {The influence of temperature and inorganic carbon (C-i) concentration on
   photosynthesis was examined in whole corals and samples of cultured
   symbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium sp.) using combined measurements
   from a membrane inlet mass spectrometer and chl a fluorometer. In whole
   corals, O-2 production at 26 degrees C was significantly limited at C-i
   concentrations below ambient seawater (similar to 2.2 mM). Further
   additions of C-i up to similar to 10 mM caused no further stimulation of
   oxygenic photosynthesis. Following exposure to 30 degrees C (2 d), net
   oxygen production decreased significantly in whole corals, as a result
   of reduced production of photosynthetically derived oxygen rather than
   increased host consumption. Whole corals maintained a rate of oxygen
   evolution around eight times lower than cultured Symbiodinium sp. at
   inorganic carbon concentrations < 2 mM, but cultures displayed greater
   levels of photoinhibition following heat treatment (30 degrees C, 2 d).
   Whole corals and cultured zooxanthellae differed considerably in their
   responses to C-i concentration and moderate heat stress, demonstrating
   that cultured Symbiodinium make an incongruous model for those in
   hospite. Reduced net oxygen evolution, in whole corals, under conditions
   of low C-i (< 2 mM) has been interpreted in terms of possible sink
   limitation leading to increased nonphotochemical energy dissipation. The
   advantages of combined measurement of net gas exchange and fluorometry
   offered by this method are discussed.},

Abstract = {Exposure to elevated temperature is known to cause photosynthetic
   inhibition in the coral symbiont Symbiodinium sp. Through the use of the
   artificial electron acceptor, methyl viologen, this study identified how
   reduced photosynthetic capacity occurs as a result of inhibition up-
   and/or downstream of ferredoxin in Symbiodinium sp. in hospite and in
   culture. Heterogeneity between coral species and symbiont clades was
   identified in the thermal sensitivity of photosynthesis in the symbionts
   of the scleractinian corals Stylophora pistillata and Pocillopora
   damicornis, as well as among Symbiodinium cultures of clades A, B, and
   C. The in hospite symbionts of S. pistillata and the cultured clade C
   Symbiodinium both exhibited similar patterns in that their primary site
   of thermal inhibition occurred downstream of ferredoxin at 32 degrees C.
   In contrast, the primary site of thermal inhibition occurred upstream of
   ferredoxin in clades A and B at 32 degrees C, while at 34 degrees C, all
   samples showed combined up- and downstream inhibition. Although clade C
   is common to both P. damicornis and S. pistillata, the manner of thermal
   inhibition was not consistent when observed in hospite. Results showed
   that there is heterogeneity in the primal site of thermal damage in
   Symbiodinium among coral species and symbiont clades.},

Abstract = {Elevated temperature (28-34-degrees-C) has been hypothesized as the
   primary cause of the loss of algal endosymbionts in coral
   reef-associated invertebrates, a phenomenon observed on a world-wide
   scale over the last decade. In past studies of this ``bleaching{''}
   phenomenon, there has been an underlying assumption that temperature
   adversely affects the animal hosts, the algae thereby being relegated to
   a more passive role. Because photosynthesis is a sensitive indicator of
   thermal stress in plants and has a central role in the nutrition of
   symbiotic invertebrates, we have tested the hypothesis that elevated
   temperature adversely affects photosynthesis in the symbiotic
   dinoflagellate Symbiodinium microadriaticum. The results, based on
   analyses of light-mediated O2 evolution and in vivo fluorescence,
   indicate that photosynthesis is impaired at temperatures above
   30-degrees-C and ceases completely at 34-36-degrees-C. These
   observations are discussed in the context of possible mechanisms that
   may function in the disassociation of algal-invertebrate symbioses in
   response to elevated temperature.},

Abstract = {Nutritional interactions between corals and symbiotic dinoflagellate
   algae lie at the heart of the structural foundation of coral reefs.
   Whilst the genetic diversity of Symbiodinium has attracted particular
   interest because of its contribution to the sensitivity of corals to
   environmental changes and bleaching (i.e. disruption of
   coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis), very little is known about the in
   hospite metabolic capabilities of different Symbiodinium types. Using a
   combination of stable isotopic labelling and nanoscale secondary ion
   mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS), we investigated the ability of the intact
   symbiosis between the reef-building coral Isopora palifera, and
   SymbiodiniumC or D types, to assimilate dissolved inorganic carbon (via
   photosynthesis) and nitrogen (as ammonium). Our results indicate that
   Symbiodinium types from two clades naturally associated with I.palifera
   possess different metabolic capabilities. The SymbiodiniumC type fixed
   and passed significantly more carbon and nitrogen to its coral host than
   the D type. This study provides further insights into the metabolic
   plasticity among different Symbiodinium types in hospite and strengthens
   the evidence that the more temperature-tolerant SymbiodiniumD type may
   be less metabolically beneficial for its coral host under non-stressful
   conditions.},

Abstract = {Endosymbioses between dinoflagellate algae (Symbiodinium sp.) and
   scleractinian coral species form the foundation of coral reef
   ecosystems. The coral symbiosis is highly susceptible to elevated
   temperatures, resulting in coral bleaching, where the algal symbiont is
   released from host cells. This experiment aimed to determine the
   transcriptional changes in cultured Symbiodinium, to better understand
   the response of cellular mechanisms under future temperature conditions.
   Cultures were exposed to elevated temperatures (average 31 degrees C) or
   control conditions (24.5 degrees C) for a period of 28 days. Whole
   transcriptome sequencing of Symbiodinium cells on days 4, 19, and 28
   were used to identify differentially expressed genes under thermal
   stress. A large number of genes representing 37.01\% of the
   transcriptome (similar to 23,654 unique genes, FDR < 0.05) with
   differential expression were detected at no less than one of the time
   points. Consistent with previous studies of Symbiodinium gene
   expression, fold changes across the transcriptome were low, with 92.49\%
   differentially expressed genes at <= 2-fold change. The transcriptional
   response included differential expression of genes encoding stress
   response components such as the antioxidant network and molecular
   chaperones, cellular components such as core photosynthesis machinery,
   integral light-harvesting protein complexes and enzymes such as fatty
   acid desaturases. Differential expression of genes encoding glyoxylate
   cycle enzymes were also found, representing the first report of this in
   Symbiodinium. As photosynthate transfer from Symbiodinium to coral hosts
   provides up to 90\% of a coral's daily energy requirements, the
   implications of altered metabolic processes from exposure to thermal
   stress found in this study on coral-Symbiodinium associations are
   unknown and should be considered when assessing the stability of the
   symbiotic relationship under future climate conditions.},

Title = {The determination of activity of the enzyme Rubisco in cell extracts of

Abstract = {The dinoflagellate alga Symbiodinium sp., living in symbiosis with
   corals, clams and other invertebrates, is a primary producer in coral
   reefs and other marine ecosystems. The function of the carbon-fixing
   enzyme ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) in
   dinoflagellates is difficult to study because its activity is rapidly
   lost after extraction from the cell. We report procedures for the
   extraction of Rubisco from Symbiodinium cells and for stable storage. We
   describe a continuous assay for Rubisco activity in these crude cell
   extracts using the Mn2+ chemiluminescence of Rubisco oxygenase.
   Chemiluminescence time courses exhibited initial transients resembling
   bacterial Form II Rubisco, followed by several minutes of linearly
   decreasing activity. The initial activity was determined from
   extrapolation of this linear section of the time course. The activity of
   fast-frozen cell extracts was stable at -80 degrees C and, after thawing
   and storage on ice, remained stable for up to 1 h before declining
   non-linearly. Crude cell extracts bound {[}14C] 2-carboxy-D-arabitinol
   1,5-bisphosphate to a high molecular mass fraction separable by gel
   filtration chromatography. After pre-treatment of Symbiodinium cell
   cultures in darkness at temperatures above 30 degrees C, the extracted
   Rubisco activities decreased, with almost complete loss of activity
   above 36 degrees C. The implications for the sensitivity to elevated
   temperature of Symbiodinium photosynthesis are assessed.},

Abstract = {Symbiodinium californium (\#383, >Banaszak et al. 1993) is one of two
   known dinoflagellate symbionts of the intertidal sea anemones
   Anthopleura elegantissima, A. xanthogrammica, and A. sola and occurs
   only in hosts at southern latitudes of the North Pacific. To investigate
   if temperature restricts the latitudinal distribution of S. californium,
   growth and photosynthesis at a range of temperatures (5 degrees C-30
   degrees C) were determined for cultured symbionts. Mean specific growth
   rates were the highest between 15 degrees C and 28 degrees C (mu
   0.21-0.26 center dot d(-1)) and extremely low at 5, 10, and 30 degrees C
   (0.02-0.03 center dot d(-1)). Average doubling times ranged from 2.7 d
   (20 degrees C) to 33 d (5, 10, and 30 degrees C). Cells cultured at 10
   degrees C had the greatest cell volume (821 mu m(3)) and the highest
   percentage of motile cells (64.5\%). Growth and photosynthesis were
   uncoupled; light-saturated maximum photosynthesis (P-max) increased from
   2.9 pg C center dot cell(-1) center dot h(-1) at 20 degrees C to 13.2 pg
   C center dot cell(-1) center dot h(-1) at 30 degrees C, a 4.5-fold
   increase. Less than 11\% of daily photosynthetically fixed carbon was
   utilized for growth at 5, 10, and 30 degrees C, indicating the potential
   for high carbon translocation at these temperatures. Low temperature
   effects on growth rate, and not on photosynthesis and cell morphology,
   may restrict the distribution of S. californium to southern populations
   of its host anemones.},

Abstract = {The dinoflagellate Symbiodinium trenchii associates with a wide array of
   host corals throughout the world, and its thermal tolerance has made it
   of particular interest within the context of reef coral resilience to a
   warming climate. However, future reefs are increasingly likely to face
   combined environmental stressors, further complicating our understanding
   of how S. trenchii will possibly acclimatize to future climate
   scenarios. Over a 33-day period, we characterized the individual and
   combined affects of high temperature (26.5 vs. 31.5 degrees C), pCO(2)
   (400 vs. 760 mu atm), and elevated nutrients (0.4 and 0.2 vs. 3.5 and
   0.3 mu mol of NO3/NO2 and PO43-, respectively) on S. trenchii within the
   host coral species Turbinaria reniformis. Global analysis across all
   treatments found temperature to be the largest driver of physiological
   change. However, exposure to elevated temperature led to changes in
   symbiont physiology that differed across pCO(2) concentrations. Net
   photosynthesis and cellular chlorophyll a increased with temperature
   under ambient pCO(2), whereas temperature-related differences in
   cellular volume and its affect on pigment packaging were more pronounced
   under elevated pCO(2). Furthermore, increased nutrients mitigated the
   physiological response to high temperature under both ambient and
   elevated pCO(2) conditions and represented a significant interaction
   between all three physical parameters. Individual responses to
   temperature and pCO(2) were also observed as cellular density declined
   with elevated temperature and calcification along with respiration rates
   declined with increased pCO(2). Symbiodinium trenchii remained the
   dominant symbiont population within the host across all treatment
   combinations. Our results reveal distinct physiological changes in
   response to high temperature within the S. trenchii/T. reniformis
   symbioses that are dependent on pCO(2) and nutrient concentration, and
   represent important interactive effects to consider as we consider how
   corals will respond under future climate change scenarios.},

Title = {Alternative Photosynthetic Electron Transfers and Bleaching Phenotypes
   Upon Acute Heat Stress in <i>Symbiodinium</i> and <i>Breviolum</i> spp.
   (Symbiodiniaceae) in Culture},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {OCT 22},
Abstract = {The breakdown of the symbiosis between cnidarians and Symbiodiniaceae
   often occurs upon periods of elevated sea surface temperature and gives
   rise to bleaching events that affect coral reefs worldwide. In this
   respect, an impairment of photosynthesis would be responsible for
   light-dependent generation of toxic reactive oxygen species putatively
   contributing to death of symbionts and/or host cells. In some
   Symbiodiniaceae species, alternative photosynthetic electron flows (AEF)
   have been documented to occur upon a shift to high temperature, possibly
   contributing to photoprotection and to the balance of energetic ratio
   between photoproduced ATP and NADPH. By using a combination of in vivo
   spectrofluorimetric and oximetric techniques, we studied the capacity
   for electron rerouting toward oxygen and cyclic electron flow (CEF)
   around photosystem I in eight Symbiodiniaceae in culture belonging to
   Symbiodinium and Breviolum genera upon an acute shift from 25 to 33
   degrees C. CEF capacity was determined as the kinetic of PSI primary
   donor P700 re-reduction in the presence of DCMU, a PSII inhibitor. An
   active oxygen uptake in light was estimated by comparing net oxygen
   evolution and relative electron transport rate of PSII at different
   light intensities. Among strains that showed elevated capacity for both
   AEF, some were thermotolerant while others were thermosensitive.
   Conversely, in some thermotolerant strains, capacities for these AEF
   were low upon acute heat stress. A principal component analysis of these
   results indicates that the long-term heat tolerant/bleached phenotype of
   cultured Symbiodinium and Breviolum spp. is not correlated with a
   capacity for different AEF across isolates during early onset of acute
   heat stress.},

Abstract = {Elevated temperatures and solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation have been
   implicated as causes for the loss of symbiotic algae in corals and other
   invertebrates with photoautotrophic symbionts (i.e. bleaching).
   Significantly higher cellular concentrations of superoxide radicals and
   hydrogen peroxide are observed when cultures of Symbiodinium bermudense
   are exposed to elevated temperatures with and without exposure to UV
   radiation. This increase in oxidative stress is accompanied by a
   reduction in the quantum yield of fluorescence for photosystem 2 and
   protein-specific activities of the carboxylating enzyme, Rubisco. An
   increase in antioxidant enzyme activities is unable to protect these
   cells from oxidative stress during exposure to UV radiation and elevated
   temperatures (31 degrees C). The addition of exogenous scavengers of
   active oxygen, however, improves photosynthetic performance, but not to
   pre-exposure rates in zooxanthellae exposed to both elevated temperature
   and UV radiation, confirming a role for oxidative stress in the
   inhibition of photosynthesis by UV radiation and elevated temperatures.
   After exposure of zooxanthellae to UV radiation and elevated
   temperatures, an action spectrum for the inhibition of photosynthesis
   shows significantly greater wavelength-dependent effects of UV radiation
   between 290 and 375 nm than for zooxanthellae exposed to UV radiation

Abstract = {In 2007 and 2008, multiple sites were identified in the Wakatobi Marine
   National Park, South East Sulawesi, Indonesia, which each represented a
   point along a gradient of light quality, temperature and turbidity. This
   gradient included `optimal', intermediate and marginal sites, where
   conditions were close to the survival threshold limit for corals. Coral
   communities changed across this gradient from diverse, mixed growth form
   assemblages to specialised, massive growth form dominated communities.
   The massive coral Goniastrea aspera was the only species identified at
   the most marginal and optimal sites. Branching species Acropora formosa
   and Porites cylindrica were only identified at optimal sites. The in
   hospite Symbiodinium community also changed across the environmental
   gradient from members of the Symbiodinium clade C on optimal reefs (in
   branching and massive species) to clade D on marginal reefs ( in massive
   species). Substantial variability in respiration and photosynthesis was
   observed in massive coral species under different environmental
   conditions, which suggests that all corals cannot be considered equal
   across environments. Studying present-day marginal environments is
   crucial to further understanding of future reef bio-diversity,
   functioning and accretion, and from work presented here, it is likely
   that as future climate change extends marginal reef range, branching
   coral diversity may decrease relative to massive, more resilient corals.

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to test whether elevated pCO(2)
   predicted for the year 2100 (85.1 Pa) affects bleaching in the coral
   Seriatopora caliendrum (Ehrenberg 1834) either independently or
   interactively with high temperature (30.5 A degrees C). Response
   variables detected the sequence of events associated with the onset of
   bleaching: reduction in the photosynthetic performance of symbionts as
   measured by maximum photochemical efficiency (F (v)/F (m)) and effective
   photochemical efficiency (Delta F/F (m)') of PSII, declines in net
   photosynthesis (P (net)) and photosynthetic efficiency (alpha, alpha),
   and finally, reduced chlorophyll a and symbiont concentrations. S.
   caliendrum was collected from Nanwan Bay, Taiwan, and subjected to
   combinations of temperature (27.7 vs. 30.5 A degrees C) and pCO(2) (45.1
   vs. 85.1 Pa) for 14 days. High temperature reduced values of all
   dependent variables (i.e., bleaching occurred), but high pCO(2) did not
   affect Symbiodinium photophysiology or productivity, and did not cause
   bleaching. These results suggest that short-term exposure to 81.5 Pa
   pCO(2), alone and in combination with elevated temperature, does not
   cause or affect coral bleaching.},

Abstract = {Ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 280-400nm) is one of the potential factors
   involved in the induction of coral bleaching, loss of the endosymbiotic
   dinoflagellate Symbiodinium or their photosynthetic pigments. However,
   little has been documented on its effects on the behavior and
   recruitment of coral larvae, which sustains coral reef ecosystems. Here,
   we analyzed physiological changes in larvae of the scleractinian coral
   Pocillopora damicornis and examined the photophysiological performance
   of the symbiont algae, following exposure to incident levels of UVR and
   subsequently observed the development of coral larvae. The endosymbiotic
   algae exhibited a high sensitivity to UV-B (295-320nm) during a 6h
   exposure, showing lowered photosynthetic performance per larva and per
   algal cell, whereas the presence of UV-A (320-395nm) significantly
   stimulated photosynthesis. UVR decreased chlorophyll a concentration
   only at higher surface temperature or at the higher doses or intensities
   of UVR. Correlations between UV-absorbing compound (UVAC) contents or
   UVR sensitivity and temperature were identified, implying that UVACs
   might act as a screen or antioxidants in Pocillopora damicornis larvae.
   Larvae reared under UVR exposures showed lower levels of survivorship,
   metamorphosis and settlement, with inhibition by UV-A being much greater
   than that caused by UV-B.},

Title = {Is photoinhibition of zooxanthellae photosynthesis the primary cause of
   thermal bleaching in corals?},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The bleaching of corals in response to increases in temperature has
   resulted in significant coral reef degradation in many tropical marine
   ecosystems. This bleaching has frequently been attributed to
   photoinhibition of photosynthetic electron transport and the consequent
   photodamage to photosystem II (PSII) and the production of damaging
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the zooxanthellae (Symbiodinium spp.).
   However, these events may be because of perturbations of other processes
   occurring within the zooxanthellae or the host cells, and consequently
   constitute only secondary responses to temperature increase. The
   processes involved with the onset of photoinhibition of electron
   transport, photodamage to PSII and pigment bleaching in coral
   zooxanthellae are reviewed. Consideration is given to how increases in
   temperature might lead to perturbations of metabolic processes in the
   zooxanthellae and/or their host cells, which could trigger events
   leading to bleaching. It is concluded that production of ROS by the
   thylakoid photosynthetic apparatus in the zooxanthellae plays a major
   role in the onset of bleaching resulting from photoinhibition of
   photosynthesis, although it is not clear which particular ROS are
   involved. It is suggested that hydrogen peroxide generated in the
   zooxanthellae may have a signalling role in triggering the mechanisms
   that result in expulsion of zooxanthellae from corals.},

Title = {Broad thermal tolerance of the symbiotic dinoflagellate <i>Symbiodinium

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY},

Pages = {25-31},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima (Brandt) hosts two species of
   symbiotic dinoflagellates, known as zooxanthellae, which coexist within
   the host at southern latitudes only. One of these species, Symbiodinium
   muscatinei LaJeunesse et Trench, has a broad latitudinal distribution,
   occurring in intertidal anemones from Washington state to Southern
   California. To investigate whether high thermal tolerance contributes to
   the ability of S. muscatinei to inhabit anemones from northern and
   southern regions, the upper thermal tolerance limit for photosynthesis
   of symbionts in northern (48 degrees 24' N) populations of A.
   elegantissima was determined by subjecting anemones to a gradual
   increase in temperature from 12 degrees C to 30 degrees C over a 10-week
   period. Light-saturated photosynthetic rates of isolated zooxanthellae
   were the same over the range of 12 degrees C-24 degrees C and declined
   significantly at 26 degrees C, which is 14 degrees C and 5 degrees C
   above average summertime seawater temperatures in northern Puget Sound
   and Southern California, respectively. At 28 degrees C, zooxanthellae
   isolated from the anemones, and those expelled by their hosts, exhibited
   extremely low rates of photosynthesis and highly reduced chl content.
   The photosynthetic rates and chl content of expelled zooxanthellae were
   lower than those of retained zooxanthellae. The high thermal tolerance
   of S. muscatinei isolated from northern populations of anemones supports
   the broad latitudinal distribution of this symbiont, allowing it to
   coexist with S. californium (\#383, Banaszak et al. 1993) in southern
   populations of anemones.},

Title = {Symbiont genotype influences holobiont response to increased temperature},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {As coral reefs face warming oceans and increased coral bleaching, a
   whitening of the coral due to loss of microalgal endosymbionts, the
   possibility of evolutionary rescue offers some hope for reef
   persistence. In tightly linked mutualisms, evolutionary rescue may occur
   through evolution of the host and/or endosymbionts. Many obligate
   mutualisms are composed of relatively small, fast-growing symbionts with
   greater potential to evolve on ecologically relevant time scales than
   their relatively large, slower growing hosts. Numerous jellyfish species
   harbor closely related endosymbiont taxa to other cnidarian species such
   as coral, and are commonly used as a model system for investigating
   cnidarian mutualisms. We examined the potential for adaptation of the
   upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea xamachana to increased temperature via
   evolution of its microalgal endosymbiont, Symbiodinium microadriaticum.
   We quantified trait variation among five algal genotypes in response to
   three temperatures (26 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 32 degrees C) and
   fitness of hosts infected with each genotype. All genotypes showed
   positive growth rates at each temperature, but rates of respiration and
   photosynthesis decreased with increased temperature. Responses varied
   among genotypes but were unrelated to genetic similarity. The effect of
   temperature on asexual reproduction and the timing of development in the
   host also depended on the genotype of the symbiont. Natural selection
   could favor different algal genotypes at different temperatures,
   affecting host fitness. This eco-evolutionary interaction may be a
   critical component of understanding species resilience in increasingly
   stressful environments.},

Abstract = {To understand the effects of global climate change on reef-building
   corals, a thorough investigation of their physiological mechanisms of
   acclimatization is warranted. However, static temperature manipulations
   may underestimate the thermal complexity of the reefs in which many
   corals live. For instance, corals of Houbihu, Taiwan, experience changes
   in temperature of up to 10 degrees C over the course of a day during
   spring-tide upwelling events. To better understand the phenotypic
   plasticity of these corals, a laboratory-based experiment was conducted
   whereby specimens of Seriatopora hystrix from an upwelling reef
   (Houbihu) and conspecifics from a non-upwelling reef (Houwan) were
   exposed to both a stable seawater temperature (26 degrees C) regime and
   a regime characterized by a 6 degrees C fluctuation (23-29 degrees C)
   over a 12. h period for 7. days. A suite of physiological and molecular
   parameters was measured in samples of both treatments, as well as in
   experimental controls, to determine site of origin (SO) and temperature
   treatment (TT) responses. Only chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration and
   growth demonstrated the hypothesized trend of higher levels when exposed
   to a TT that mimicked SO conditions. In contrast, chl a, maximum
   dark-adapted quantum yield of photosystem II (F-v/F-m), and Symbiodinium
   ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rbcL), photosystem I
   (psI, subunit III) and phosphoglycolate phosphatase (pgpase) mRNA
   expression demonstrated significant TT effects. Specifically, levels of
   these response variables were higher in samples exposed to a variable
   temperature regime, suggesting that S. hystrix may acclimate to
   fluctuating temperatures by increasing its capacity for photosynthesis.},

   elegantissima</i> (Brandt).: III.: Seasonal effects of natural light and
   temperature on photosynthesis and respiration},

Abstract = {The sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima hosts two phylogenetically
   different symbiotic microalgae, a dinoflagellate Symbiodinium
   (zooxanthellae, ZX) and a chlorophyte (zoochlorellae, ZC). The
   photosynthetic productivity (P), respiration (R), and contribution of
   algal carbon translocated to the host (CZAR) in response to a year's
   seasonal ambient changes of natural light and temperature are documented
   for both ZX- and ZC-bearing anemones. Light and temperature both affect
   photosynthesis, respiration, and CZAR, as well as various algal
   parameters; while there are evident seasonal differences, for the most
   part the relative effects on P, R, and CZAR by the two environmental
   variables cannot be determined. Net photosynthesis (P-n) of both ZX and
   ZC was significantly higher during spring and summer. During these
   seasons, the P-n of ZX was always greater than that of ZC. Regardless of
   algal symbiont, anemone respiration (R) was significantly higher during
   the spring and summer. The annual net carbon fixation rate of anemones
   with ZX and ZC was 325 and 276 mg C anemone(-1) year(-1), respectively,
   which translates to annual net community productivity rates of 92 and 60
   g C m(-1) year(-1) for anemones with ZX or ZC, respectively. CZAR did
   not show a clear relationship with season; however the CZAR for ZX was
   always significantly greater than for ZC. Lower ZX growth rates, coupled
   with higher photosynthetic rates and higher CZAR estimates, compared to
   ZC, suggest that if A. elegantissima is simply carbon limited,
   ZX-bearing anemones should be the dominant symbiont in the field.
   However ZC-bearing anemones persist in low light and reduced temperature
   microhabitats, therefore more than the translocation of carbon from ZC
   must be involved. Given that global climate change will increase water
   temperatures, the potential for latitudinal range shifts of both ZC and
   ZX (S. californium and muscatinei) might be used as biological
   indicators of thermal shifts in the littoral zone of the Pacific
   Northwest.},

   Physiological Challenges of Future Climate and Ocean Change},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 28},
Abstract = {Tropical reef-building coral stress levels will intensify with the
   predicted rising atmospheric CO2 resulting in ocean temperature and
   acidification increase. Most studies to date have focused on the
   destabilization of coral-dinoflagellate symbioses due to warming oceans,
   or declining calcification due to ocean acidification. In our study, pH
   and temperature conditions consistent with the end-of-century scenarios
   of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) caused major
   changes in photosynthesis and respiration, in addition to decreased
   calcification rates in the coral Acropora millepora. Population density
   of symbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium) under high levels of ocean
   acidification and temperature (Representative Concentration Pathway,
   RCP8.5) decreased to half of that found under present day conditions,
   with photosynthetic and respiratory rates also being reduced by 40\%.
   These physiological changes were accompanied by evidence for gene
   regulation of calcium and bicarbonate transporters along with components
   of the organic matrix. Meta-transcriptomic RNA-Seq data analyses showed
   an overall down regulation of metabolic transcripts, and an increased
   abundance of transcripts involved in circadian clock control,
   controlling the damage of oxidative stress, calcium
   signaling/homeostasis, cytoskeletal interactions, transcription
   regulation, DNA repair, Wnt signaling and apoptosis/immunity/toxins. We
   suggest that increased maintenance costs under ocean acidification and
   warming, and diversion of cellular ATP to pH homeostasis, oxidative
   stress response, UPR and DNA repair, along with metabolic suppression,
   may underpin why Acroporid species tend not to thrive under future
   environmental stress. Our study highlights the potential increased
   energy demand when the coral holobiont is exposed to high levels of
   ocean warming and acidification.},

   Cassiopea xamachana symbiotic with zooxanthellae: effect of jellyfish
   size and season},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {168},
Pages = {147-162},
Abstract = {The association between the symbiont Symbiodinium microadriaticum
   (zooxanthellae) and its host jellyfish, Cassiopea xamachana, was
   investigated as a function of jellyfish size and season. Symbiont cell
   diameter and volume were higher during January than September. Although
   zooxanthella-specific chlorophyll was independent of jellyfish size,
   both chlorophyll a and c were higher during January. Regardless of
   season, algal density and jellyfish size were inversely related. The
   diel mitotic index (MI) of zooxanthellae was phased, with a peak of
   0.25\% occurring between 09:00 and 12:00 h. September photosynthetic
   rates were always higher than January rates and reflected the seasonal
   light and temperature regimes at the latitude of the Florida Keys (USA).
   Photosynthesis, when normalized to either zooxanthella density or
   protein, displayed an inverse relationship with jellyfish size. Medusan
   respiration rates also showed an inverse relationship with jellyfish
   size, with September metabolism being higher than that of January. The
   carbon budgets calculated for these medusae indicate that the carbon
   photosynthetically fixed by the zooxanthellae, and subsequently
   translocated to the host, is capable of satisfying about 169\% of the
   host's metabolic demand (CZAR) and is independent of both jellyfish size
   and season. These seasonally influenced physiological effects underscore
   the necessity for seasonal examinations of algal-cnidarian symbioses in
   order to understand the photophysiology of the association on an annual
   basis.},

Title = {Symbiosis and host morphological variation: Symbiodiniaceae
   photosynthesis in the octocoral <i>Briareum asbestinum</i> at ambient
   and elevated temperatures},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Intra-species morphological variation may occur in sessile organisms,
   such as corals, living in different habitats. Conversely, the octocoral
   Briareum asbestinum exhibits both encrusting and upright branching
   morphologies at the same shallow water habitat, enabling studying
   physiological differences uncoupled from habitat variation due to depth
   or reef location. We investigated the mutualism between endosymbiotic
   dinoflagellate algae, Breviolum spp. (previously clade B Symbiodinium),
   and these B. asbestinum morphologies at ambient and elevated
   temperatures. Based on msh1 gene sequences, the host morphologies were
   genetically similar although they differed in protein content, polyp
   expansion behavior, and associated Breviolum (B19 for encrusting and B21
   for branching B. asbestinum). Due to colony orientation, polyps in
   encrusting B. asbestinum experienced irradiance levels nearly three
   times higher than polyps in the branching morph, which probably
   contributed to the lower photochemical and light absorption efficiencies
   of the Breviolum in encrusting fragments. The light-limited portion of
   photosynthesis-irradiance curves and the intracellular chlorophyll
   concentrations, however, indicated that Breviolum in both morphologies
   were acclimated to similar internal irradiances. Encrusting B.
   asbestinum exhibited higher Breviolum density, areal chlorophyll a, and
   greater photosynthetic rates cm(-2) compared to branching B. asbestinum.
   Notably, elevated temperature did not cause bleaching in either
   morphology, as Breviolum and chlorophyll densities did not differ
   significantly from ambient temperature, although the two morphologies
   adjusted some of the measured parameters, indicating coping with the
   stressor. In the face of continued ocean warming, the high thermal
   tolerance of octocorals may reinforce the shift of Caribbean reefs from
   scleractinian coral to octocoral dominance.},

   coral <i>Stylophora pistillata</i> during bleaching},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {272},
Pages = {117-130},
Abstract = {Rising sea temperatures are increasing the incidences of mass coral
   bleaching (the dissociation of the coral-algal symbiosis) and coral
   mortality. In this study, the effects of bleaching (induced by elevated
   light and temperature) on the condition of symbiotic dinoflagellates
   (Symbiodinium sp.) within the tissue of the hard coral Stylophora
   pistillata (Esper) were assessed using a suite of techniques. Bleaching
   of S. pistillata was accompanied by declines in the maximum potential
   quantum yield of photosynthesis (F-v/F-m, measured using pulse amplitude
   modulated {[}PAM] fluorometry), an increase in the number of
   Sytox-green-stained algae (indicating compromised algal membrane
   integrity and cell death), an increase in
   2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluroscein diacetate (H(2)DCFDA)stained algae
   (indicating increased oxidative stress), as well as ultrastructural
   changes (vacuolisation, losses of chlorophyll, and an increase in
   accumulation bodies). Algae expelled from S. pistillata exhibited a
   complete disorganisation of cellular contents; expelled cells contained
   only amorphous material. In situ samples taken during a natural mass
   coral bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef in February 2002 also
   revealed a high number of Sytox-labelled algae cells in symbio.
   Dinoflagellate degeneration during bleaching seems to be similar to the
   changes resulting from senescence-phase cell death in cultured algae.
   These data support a role for oxidative stress in the mechanism of coral
   bleaching and highlight the importance of algal degeneration during the
   bleaching of a reef coral.},

   orientalis under B1 displayed a dramatic increase in lateral tissue
   extension, but bleached and displayed reduced rates of respiration and
   photosynthesis. Some B1 sponge replicates died by the end of the
   experiment. Under A1FI, strong bleaching and subsequent mortality of all
   C. orientalis replicates occurred at an early stage of the experiment.
   Mortality arrested bioerosion by C. orientalis under B1 and A1FI.
   Overall, the absolute amount of calcium carbonate eroded by C.
   orientalis under B1 or A1FI was similar to that under PI or PD at the
   end of the experiment. Although bioerosion rates were raised by
   short-term experimental acidification in previous studies, our findings
   from the photosymbiotic C. orientalis imply that the effects of
   bioerosion on reef carbonate budgets may only be temporary if the
   bioeroders cannot survive long-term in the future oceans.},

Title = {Exploring mechanisms that affect coral cooperation: symbiont
   transmission mode, cell density and community composition},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {DEC 3},
Abstract = {The coral symbiosis is the linchpin of the reef ecosystem, yet the
   mechanisms that promote and maintain cooperation between hosts and
   symbionts have not been fully resolved. We used a phylogenetically
   controlled design to investigate the role of vertical symbiont
   transmission, an evolutionary mechanism in which symbionts are inherited
   directly from parents, predicted to enhance cooperation and holobiont
   fitness. Six species of coral, three vertical transmitters and their
   closest horizontally transmitting relatives, which exhibit environmental
   acquisition of symbionts, were fragmented and subjected to a 2-week
   thermal stress experiment. Symbiont cell density, photosynthetic
   function and translocation of photosynthetically fixed carbon between
   symbionts and hosts were quantified to assess changes in physiological
   performance and cooperation. All species exhibited similar decreases in
   symbiont cell density and net photosynthesis in response to elevated
   temperature, consistent with the onset of bleaching. Yet baseline
   cooperation, or translocation of photosynthate, in ambient conditions
   and the reduction in cooperation in response to elevated temperature
   differed among species. Although Porites lobata and Galaxea acrhelia did
   exhibit the highest levels of baseline cooperation, we did not observe
   universally higher levels of cooperation in vertically transmitting
   species. Post hoc sequencing of the Symbiodinium ITS-2 locus was used to
   investigate the potential role of differences in symbiont community
   composition. Interestingly, reductions in cooperation at the onset of
   bleaching tended to be associated with increased symbiont community
   diversity among coral species. The theoretical benefits of evolving
   vertical transmission are based on the underlying assumption that the
   host-symbiont relationship becomes genetically uniform, thereby reducing
   competition among symbionts. Taken together, our results suggest that it
   may not be vertical transmission per se that influences host-symbiont
   cooperation, but genetic uniformity of the symbiont community, although
   additional work is needed to test this hypothesis.},

Title = {Physiological correlates of symbiont migration during bleaching of two

Abstract = {Perturbed colonies of Phenganax parrini and Sarcothelia sp. exhibit
   migration of symbionts of Symbiodinium spp. into the stolons.
   Densitometry and visual inspection indicated that polyps bleached while
   stolons did not. When migration was triggered by temperature, light and
   confinement, colonies of Sarcothelia sp. decreased rates of oxygen
   formation in the light (due to the effects of perturbation on
   photosynthesis and respiration) and increased rates of oxygen uptake in
   the dark (due to the effects of perturbation on respiration alone).
   Colonies of P. parrini, by contrast, showed no significant changes in
   either aspect of oxygen metabolism. When migration was triggered by
   light and confinement, colonies of Sarcothelia sp. showed decreased
   rates of oxygen formation in the light and increased rates of oxygen
   uptake in the dark, while colonies of P. parrini maintained the former
   and increased the latter. During symbiont migration into their stolons,
   colonies of both species showed dramatic increases in reactive oxygen
   species (ROS), as visualized with a fluorescent probe, with stolons of
   Sarcothelia sp. exhibiting a nearly immediate increase of ROS.
   Differences in symbiont type may explain the greater sensitivity of
   colonies of Sarcothelia sp. Using fluorescent probes, direct
   measurements of migrating symbionts in the stolons of Sarcothelia sp.
   showed higher levels of reactive nitrogen species and lower levels of
   ROS than the surrounding host tissue. As measured by native
   fluorescence, levels of NAD(P) H in the stolons were unaffected by
   perturbation. Symbiont migration thus correlates with dramatic
   physiological changes and may serve as a marker for coral condition.},

Title = {The effects of substratum type on the growth, mortality, and

Volume = {384},

Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Coral larvae are selective with regards to the surfaces upon which they
   settle, but little is known about the outcome of these choices. In this
   study, we explored the implications for juvenile scleractinians (<40-mm
   diameter) of growing on igneous versus carbonate rock on the shallow
   reefs (5-m depth) of St. John, US Virgin Islands. Surveys revealed that
   juvenile corals occurred at densities of 16 colonies m(-2) and were
   distributed on igneous and carbonate rocks in proportion to the
   abundance of these surfaces, suggesting that larvae do not discriminate
   between rock types at settlement. Repeated surveys demonstrated that all
   juvenile corals (i.e., pooled among taxa) grew 41\% slower on igneous
   versus carbonate rock between January and August, but not between August
   and January when the growth was statistically indistinguishable between
   rock types. Although the growth of the most common juvenile coral,
   Porites astreoides, was similar on both substrata, the photophysiology
   of this species was affected by the type of rock. The maximum relative
   electron transfer rate (rETR, a proxy for photosynthesis) of P.
   astreoides was down-regulated 30\% on igneous compared to carbonate
   rock. Phylogenetic analyses of the Symbiodinium community sequence
   profiles within P. astreoides revealed significant differences between
   substrata, with a greater diversity of co-occurring ITS-2 sequences in
   corals growing on carbonate compared to igneous rock. While
   substratum-dependent patterns in the characteristics of juvenile corals
   suggested there is selective value to the settlement choices made by
   larvae, these trends did not translate into differences in survival, at
   least over the time scale investigated. It remains uncertain what
   features of the rocks affected coral performance, but differences in the
   temperature of the rock may be an important feature during the warmest
   period of the year. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Rising seawater temperature and ocean acidification threaten the
   survival of coral reefs. The relationship between coral physiology and
   its microbiome may reveal why some corals are more resilient to these
   global change conditions. Here, we conducted the first experiment to
   simultaneously investigate changes in the coral microbiome and coral
   physiology in response to the dual stress of elevated seawater
   temperature and ocean acidification expected by the end of this century.
   Two species of corals, Acropora millepora containing the thermally
   sensitive endosymbiont C21a and Turbinaria reniformis containing the
   thermally tolerant endosymbiont Symbiodinium trenchi, were exposed to
   control (26.5 degrees C and pCO(2) of 364 mu atm) and treatment (29.0
   degrees C and pCO(2) of 750 mu atm) conditions for 24 days, after which
   we measured the microbial community composition. These microbial
   findings were interpreted within the context of previously published
   physiological measurements from the exact same corals in this study
   (calcification, organic carbon flux, ratio of photosynthesis to
   respiration, photosystem II maximal efficiency, total lipids, soluble
   animal protein, soluble animal carbohydrates, soluble algal protein,
   soluble algal carbohydrate, biomass, endosymbiotic algal density, and
   chlorophyll a). Overall, dually stressed A. millepora had reduced
   microbial diversity, experienced large changes in microbial community
   composition, and experienced dramatic physiological declines in
   calcification, photosystem II maximal efficiency, and algal
   carbohydrates. In contrast, the dually stressed coral T. reniformis
   experienced a stable and more diverse microbiome community with minimal
   physiological decline, coupled with very high total energy reserves and
   particulate organic carbon release rates. Thus, the microbiome changed
   and microbial diversity decreased in the physiologically sensitive coral
   with the thermally sensitive endosymbiotic algae but not in the
   physiologically tolerant coral with the thermally tolerant endosymbiont.
   Our results confirm recent findings that temperature-stress tolerant
   corals have a more stable microbiome, and demonstrate for the first time
   that this is also the case under the dual stresses of ocean warming and
   acidification. We propose that coral with a stable microbiome are also
   more physiologically resilient and thus more likely to persist in the
   future, and shape the coral species diversity of future reef ecosystems.},

Title = {Caribbean scleractinian corals exhibit highly variable tolerances to
   acute hypoxia},

Abstract = {IntroductionClimate change, and the increase in sea surface temperature,
   is exacerbating ocean deoxygenation because of the inherent property of
   seawater to sequester less dissolved gas, such as oxygen, at warmer
   temperatures. While most coral reef studies focus on the effects of
   thermal stress and ocean acidification, few studies acknowledge the
   threat of hypoxia. Hypoxia is traditionally defined as 6.3 kPa (2 mg L-1
   O2), however, a universal hypoxia threshold is not useful given the vast
   range of responses among marine organisms. The range of metabolic
   responses and tolerances to hypoxia are unknown for Caribbean coral
   species and their algal symbionts. ObjectiveHere, we quantified the
   spectrum of acute hypoxia tolerances and the range of metabolic
   responses of six ecologically and structurally important Caribbean coral
   species (Acropora cervicornis, Siderastrea radians, Siderastrea siderea,
   Porites astreoides, Porites porites, and Orbicella faveolata) and their
   algal symbionts (Symbiodinium, Breviolum, and Durusdinium spp.).
   MethodsA total of 24 coral fragments (4 individuals per species) were
   exposed to 10 distinct oxygen concentrations ranging from normoxia
   (20.38 kPa) to severe hypoxia (3.3 kPa). We used intermittent flow
   respirometry to measure coral host respiration in the dark and algal
   symbiont photosynthesis in the light at each oxygen level. We determined
   a line of best fit for the metabolic rate vs. PO2 data and calculated
   the critical oxygen partial pressure (PO2 crit), a method that has not
   been tested on symbiotic species. ResultsCoral species and their algal
   symbionts measured here displayed a wide range of hypoxia tolerances.
   For the coral hosts, PO2 crit values differed roughly two-fold ranging
   from 5.74 kPa to 16.93 kPa, and for the algal symbionts, PO2 crit values
   differed roughly three-fold ranging from 3.9 kPa to 11.3 kPa.
   DiscussionThese results should be regarded as a first step to
   characterizing the metabolic response and acute tolerance of multiple
   coral hosts and algal symbionts to a wide range of oxygen
   concentrations. Given that some PO2 crit values were above the generally
   accepted hypoxia threshold, these results have implications for the
   community composition of reefs under a rapidly changing climate and can
   guide purposeful reef restoration.},

Abstract = {The roles of temperature and light on grazing and photosynthesis were
   examined for Dinobryon sociale, a common freshwater mixotrophic alga.
   Photosynthetic rate was determined for D. sociale adapted to
   temperatures of 8, 12, 16, and 20 degrees C under photosynthetically
   active radiation light irradiances of 25, 66, and 130 mu mol photons .
   m(-2) . s(-1), with concurrent measurement of bacterial ingestion at all
   temperatures under medium and high light (66 and 130 mu mol photons .
   m(-2) . s(-1)). Rates of ingestion and photosynthesis increased with
   temperature to a maximum at 16 degrees C under the two higher light
   regimes, and declined at 20 degrees C. Although both light and
   temperature had a marked effect on photosynthesis, there was no
   significant difference in bacterivory at medium and high irradiances at
   any given temperature. At the lowest light condition (25 mu mol photons
   . m(-2) . s(-1)), photosynthesis remained low and relatively stable at
   all temperatures. D. sociale acquired the majority of carbon from
   photosynthesis, although the low photosynthetic rate without a
   concurrent decline in feeding rate at 8 degrees C suggested 20\%-30\% of
   the carbon budget could be attributed to bacterivory at low
   temperatures. Grazing experiments in nutrient-modified media revealed
   that this mixotroph had increased ingestion rates when either dissolved
   nitrogen or phosphorus was decreased. This work increases our
   understanding of environmental effects on mixotrophic nutrition.
   Although the influence of abiotic factors on phagotrophy and phototrophy
   in pure heterotrophs and phototrophs has been well studied, much less is
   known for mixotrophic organisms.},

Abstract = {The metabolic theory of ecology predicts that temperature affects
   heterotrophic processes more strongly than autotrophic processes. We
   hypothesized that this differential temperature response may shift
   mixotrophic organisms towards more heterotrophic nutrition with rising
   temperature. The hypothesis was tested in experiments with the
   mixotrophic chrysophyte Ochromonas sp., grown under autotrophic,
   mixotrophic and heterotrophic conditions. Our results show that (1)
   grazing rates on bacterial prey increased more strongly with temperature
   than photosynthetic electron transport rates, (2) heterotrophic growth
   rates increased exponentially with temperature over the entire range
   from 13 to 33 degrees C, while autotrophic growth rates reached a
   maximum at intermediate temperatures and (3) chlorophyll contents during
   mixotrophic growth decreased at high temperature. Hence, the
   contribution of photosynthesis to mixotrophic growth strongly decreased
   with temperature. These findings support the hypothesis that mixotrophs
   become more heterotrophic with rising temperature, which alters their
   functional role in food webs and the carbon cycle.},

Title = {Temperature-light shapes the nutritional strategy of a mixotrophic green
   alga, Picochlorum sp. GLMF1 (Trebouxiophyceae)},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},

Month = {JUN 29},
Abstract = {Constitutive mixotrophs (CM), combining phagotrophy with inherent
   phototrophy, are critical primary producers and consumers in marine
   pelagic food webs. However, how mixotrophs, especially obligate CM,
   balance phototrophy and phagotrophy in response to changing
   environmental conditions remains equivocal. Here, we examined the growth
   performance, photosynthesis traits, and phagotrophic activities of a
   mixotrophic green alga, Picochlorum sp. GLMF1, over a wide range of
   temperature-irradiance combinations. The growth of Picochlorum sp.
   exhibited a unimodal thermal response under all the experimental light
   intensities. The optimal growth temperature decreased dramatically when
   the irradiance exceeded 80 mu mol m-2 s-1, whereas the maximum growth
   rate kept a relatively constant and high value (around 1.1 d-1). This
   might be attributed to the trade-off between photosynthesis and
   ingestion under various light and temperature conditions. We found that
   the photosynthetic electron transport rate (ETR) and chlorophyll a
   specific inorganic carbon uptake rate increased with increasing
   irradiance. The maximum ETR decreased from 22.26 +/- 1.93 mu mol e m-2
   s-1 at 22 degrees C to 8.96 +/- 0.42 mu mol e m-2 s-1 at 31 degrees C,
   suggesting a significant constraint of photosynthesis at high
   temperature. By contrast, ingestion increased with increasing
   temperature in most cases, and was significantly lower under high
   irradiance conditions. Combining the contributions of phototrophic and
   phagotrophic processes to total carbon acquisition, Picochlorum sp.
   showed a flexible nutritional strategy in response to temperature and
   light. Increasing light favors photosynthesis, whereas warming
   stimulates phagotrophy. Such complementation allows them to flourish
   under a wide range of temperature and irradiance. Our study adds
   knowledge to the nutritional strategy of mixotrophic green algae, with
   significant implications for their ecological role in marine food webs
   under projected climate change.},

Abstract = {The coupling between mitochondrial respiration and photosynthesis plays
   an important role in the energetic physiology of green plants and some
   secondary-red photosynthetic eukaryotes (diatoms), allowing an efficient
   CO2 assimilation and optimal growth. Using the flagellate Euglena
   gracilis, we first tested if photosynthesis-respiration coupling occurs
   in this species harbouring secondary green plastids (i.e. originated
   from an endosymbiosis between a green alga and a phagotrophic
   euglenozoan). Second, we tested how the trophic state (mixotrophy and
   photoautotrophy) of the cell alters the mechanisms involved in the
   photosynthesis-respiration coupling. Energetic coupling between
   photosynthesis and respiration was determined by testing the effect of
   respiratory inhibitors on photosynthesis, and measuring the simultaneous
   variation of photosynthesis and respiration rates as a function of
   temperature (i.e. thermal response curves). The mechanism involved in
   the photosynthesis-respiration coupling was assessed by combining
   proteomics, biophysical and cytological analyses. Our work shows that
   there is photosynthesis-respiration coupling and membrane contacts
   between mitochondria and chloroplasts in E. gracilis. However, whereas
   in mixotrophy adjustment of the chloroplast ATP/NADPH ratio drives the
   interaction, in photoautotrophy the coupling is conditioned by CO2
   limitation and photorespiration. This indicates that maintenance of
   photosynthesis-respiration coupling, through plastic metabolic
   responses, is key to E. gracilis functioning under changing
   environmental conditions.},

Abstract = {To investigate the consequences of increased temperature and enhanced
   input of dissolved organic matter (DOM) into lakes for heterotrophicic
   bacteria and for mixotrophic algae which use DOM in addition to
   photosynthesis, the hypotheses were tested whether (1) both bacteria and
   mixotrophic algae benefit from increased input of DOM, or (2) increased
   DOM input enhances bacterial biomass and thereby decreases algal
   biomass. Growth experiments in batch cultures, exudation measurements,
   and competition experiments in chemostats were performed at two
   temperature levels. Increased temperature stimulated the autotrophic
   growth rate of Chlorella protothecoides. Bacteria and Chlorella
   increased their heterotrophic growth rates at higher DOM concentration
   at lower temperature whereas enhanced DOM concentration hardly
   stimulated their growth at higher temperature. In chemostats, enhanced
   input of soil extract increased both bacterial and algal biomass at
   lower temperature whereas bacterial biomass increased only slightly and
   algal biomass decreased at higher temperature. Thus, the temperature
   determines the response of microorganisms to enhanced DOM concentration.},

Title = {<i>Synechococcus</i> sp strain PCC 7002 transcriptome: acclimation to
   temperature, salinity, oxidative stress, and mixotrophic growth
   conditions},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 is a unicellular, euryhaline
   cyanobacterium. It is a model organism for studies of cyanobacterial
   metabolism and has great potential for biotechnological applications. It
   exhibits an exceptional tolerance of high-light irradiation and shows
   very rapid growth. The habitats from which this and closely related
   strains were isolated are subject to changes in several environmental
   factors, including light, nutrient supply, temperature, and salinity. In
   this study global transcriptome profiling via RNAseq has been used to
   perform a comparative and integrated study of global changes in cells
   grown at different temperatures, at different salinities, and under
   mixotrophic conditions, when a metabolizable organic carbon source was
   present. Furthermore, the transcriptomes were investigated for cells
   that were subjected to a heat shock and that were exposed to oxidative
   stress. Lower growth temperatures caused relatively minor changes of the
   transcriptome; the most prominent changes affected fatty acid
   desaturases. A heat shock caused severe changes of the transcriptome
   pattern; transcripts for genes associated with major metabolic pathways
   declined and those for different chaperones increased dramatically.
   Oxidative stress, however, left the transcript pattern almost
   unaffected. When grown at high salinity, Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 had
   increased expression of genes involved in compatible solute biosynthesis
   and showed increased mRNA levels for several genes involved in electron
   transport. Transcripts of two adjacent genes dramatically increased upon
   growth at high salinity; the respective proteins are putatively involved
   in coping with oxidative stress and in triggering ion channels. Only
   minor changes were observed when cells were grown at low salinity or
   when the growth medium was supplemented with glycerol. However, the
   transcriptome data suggest that cells must acclimate to excess reducing
   equivalents when a reduced C-source is present.},

   0.33 and 1.65 mug l(-1) in Tvillingvatnet and 0.2 and 0.3 mug l(-1) in
   Lake OS. The phytoplankton was dominated by chrysophytes and
   cryptophytes, with the diatom Rhizosolenia and a number of
   dinoflagellate species. Rates of photosynthesis were typically low,
   between 24.5 mug and 1.0 mg l(-1) day(-1) in Tvillingvatnet
   (photosynthetic efficiency 0.004-0.26), and between 3.1 and 29.5 mug
   l(-1) day (-1) in Lake OS (photosynthetic efficiency 0.0019-0.0085).
   Among the phytoflagellates (PNAN) there were a number of mixotrophs
   which reached their peaks of abundance before other PNAN. Mixotrophy
   appeared to provide a competitive advantage. Grazing rates for the
   mixotroph Dinobryon ranged between 0.063 and 1.12 pg C cell(-1) day(-1)
   in Lake OS and between 0.22 and 1.11 pg cell(-1) day(-1) in
   Tvillingvatnet, with rates increasing between July and August. However,
   Dinobryon removed less than 1\% of bacterial biomass day(-1), while the
   heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNAN) removed up to 28\% of bacterial
   biomass day(-1). Bacterial concentrations were low, with a maximum of
   28.8x10(8) l(-1) in Tvillingvatnet and 23.6x10(8) l(-1) in Lake OS.
   Ciliated protozoan and rotifer diversity in the plankton was low.},

Title = {Photosynthesis and respiration of the soft coral <i>Xenia umbellata</i>
   respond to warming but not to organic carbon eutrophication},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUL 27},
Abstract = {Eutrophication with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as a far
   under-investigated stressor, and ocean warming, can strongly affect
   coral reefs and hard corals as major reefs ecosystem engineers. However,
   no previous studies have investigated the metabolic responses of soft
   corals to DOC eutrophication, or its interaction with ocean warming.
   Thus, we investigated respiration and photosynthesis response of Xenia
   umbellata, a common mixotrophic soft coral from the Indo-pacific, to (1)
   three levels of DOC eutrophication simulated by glucose addition over
   the first 21 days of experiment and (2) ocean warming scenarios where
   the temperature was gradually increased from 26 degrees C (control
   condition) to 32 degrees C over another 24 days in an aquarium
   experiment. We found no significant difference in response to DOC
   treatments and all corals survived regardless of the DOC concentrations,
   whilst subsequent exposure to simulated ocean warming significantly
   decreased gross photosynthesis by approximately 50\% at 30 degrees C,
   and 65\% at 32 degrees C, net photosynthesis by 75\% at 30 degrees C and
   79\% at 32 degrees C, and respiration by a maximum of 75\% at 30 degrees
   C; with a slight increase at 32 degrees C of 25\%. The ratio between
   gross photosynthesis and respiration decreased by the end of the warming
   period but remained similar between controls and colonies previously
   exposed to DOC. Our findings suggest that soft corals may be more
   resistant than hard corals to DOC eutrophication and in consequence, may
   potentially experiment in less magnitude the negative effects of
   increased temperature or subsequently both stressors. The results of
   this study may contribute to explain the successful role of soft corals
   in phase shifts as reported from many coral reefs. Where predicted
   declines in reef ecosystems health due to increased eutrophication
   levels can be exacerbated by future warming.},

Title = {Elevated temperature mitigates the prolonged effect of high nitrogen on
   Microcystis aeruginosa removal through mixotrophic <i>Ochromonas
   gloeopara</i> grazing},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {820},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {Cyanobacterial blooms are increasingly threatening the aquatic ecosystem
   functioning as a result of the global warming and eutrophication. The
   ``top-down{''} control of cyanobacteria from consumers like the
   protozoans shows great potential because of the effectiveness and
   environment-friendliness. To reveal how the nutrition availability and
   elevated temperature affect the cyanobacteria removal through protozoans
   grazing, we grew the toxic Microcystis aeruginosa and the mixotrophic
   Ochromonas gloeopara in monocultures and cocultures at environmentally
   relevant ni-trogen levels (0.5-8.0 mg L-1) under 25 degrees C and 30
   degrees C, respectively. The growth of M. aeruginosa in monocultures was
   significantly enhanced as nitrogen concentration and temperature rose,
   partially benefitting from the promoted pho-tosynthesis. By contrast,
   nitrogen availability affected neither the photoautotrophic growth nor
   the feeding on Microcystis of the mixotrophic O. gloeopara, but high
   temperature induced the mixotroph to be more heterotrophic as evidenced
   by the suppressed photosynthesis but strengthened feeding activity.
   Accordingly, the M. aeruginosa re-moval through O. gloeopara grazing in
   cocultures was delayed with increasing nitrogen, which, however, was
   sharply accelerated by elevated temperature. Based on the Gaussian
   models fitting, the theoretical time that the Microcystis was removed at
   25 degrees C was prolonged from about 7.5 days to 10 days with increased
   nitrogen, but it was reduced to less than 4.6 days in all groups at 30
   degrees C. While the intensity of Microcystis blooms is strongly
   positively correlated to the nutrition availability and temperature, the
   present study provided references for the practical application of
   Microcystis removal through grazing outdoors.},

Journal = {MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {179},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Sudden environmental changes like marine heatwaves will become more
   intense and frequent in the future. Understanding the physiological
   responses of mixoplankton and protozooplankton, key members of marine
   food webs, to temperature is crucial. Here, we studied two
   dinoflagellates (one protozoo- and one mixoplanktonic), two ciliates
   (one protozoo- and one mixoplanktonic), and two cryptophytes. We report
   the acute (24 h) responses on growth and grazing to a range of
   temperatures (5-34 degrees C). We also determined respiration and
   photosynthetic rates for the four grazers within 6 degrees C of warming.
   The thermal performance curves showed that, in general, ciliates have
   higher optimal temperatures than dinoflagellates and that
   protozooplankton is better adapted to warming than mixoplankton. Our
   results confirmed that warmer temperatures decrease the cellular volumes
   of all species. Q(10) coefficients suggest that grazing is the rate that
   increases the most in response to temperature in protozooplankton. Yet,
   in mixoplankton, grazing decreased in warmer temperatures, whereas
   photosynthesis increased. Therefore, we suggest that the Metabolic
   Theory of Ecology should reassess mixoplankton's position for the
   correct parameterisation of future climate change models. Future studies
   should also address the multigenerational response to temperature
   changes, to confirm whether mixoplankton become more phototrophic than
   phagotrophic in a warming scenario after adaptation.},

Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {120},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The influence of light and temperature on the phytoplankton succession
   in a temperate sea area was investigated in laboratory experiments with
   natural assemblages of micro-, nano-, and picoplankton collected from
   the northern Baltic Sea during 1989 and 1990. Respiration increased from
   0 to 30 degrees C in all groups of phytoplankton, while gross
   photosynthesis stabilised at 10 to 15 degrees C. Light saturation
   occurred at 25 to 75 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1), indicating low light
   adaptation of the algae. Picoplankton showed the strongest temperature
   response, and at temperatures above 10 degrees C picoplankton obtained a
   higher biomass specific photosynthesis than that of the other groups.
   Different light treatments had no effect on the species composition in
   experiments with natural algal assemblages, while different temperature
   conditions had a marked effect. With a temperature increase from 0 to 10
   degrees C, the algal community changed from a typical spring community,
   with diatoms and dinoflagellates, to a summer community, dominated by
   mixotrophic nanoflagellates. The small, or often non-existing, autumn
   bloom in the sea area studied, can be explained by short day lengths
   combined with relatively high temperatures, causing high community
   respiration rates and low gross photosynthesis, resulting in a negative
   energy balance. The net energy gain depends on a differential
   temperature effect on gross photosynthesis and endogenous respiration in
   various plankton groups. This gives the phytoplankton groups diverse
   competitive advantages during different seasons and thus may be an
   important factor in controlling algal succession.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PLANT INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {2},
Number = {4},
Pages = {253-261},
Abstract = {Chlorophyllous Mediterranean orchids share a habitat endangered by
   climate change and land use change. These orchids are characterized by
   two mechanisms of carbon assimilation, being autotrophic carbon fixation
   through photosynthesis supplemented by heterotrophic carbon fixation
   from mycorrhizal fungi. We investigated whether photosynthesis may
   sustain autotrophy of several species of orchids co-occurring in the
   same habitat (the understory of a chestnut forest in the Apennines
   range) along a vegetative season, and how photosynthesis responds to
   environmental parameters in the different species. Combined analysis of
   gas-exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, optical properties, chlorophylls
   concentration, and Ribulose 1,5 bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase
   (Rubisco) activity were carried out to characterize the photosynthetic
   apparatus of the orchid species. Both in vivo and in vitro measurements
   indicated that in all orchids, in natural conditions and over the entire
   vegetative season (May to July), a detectable amount of carbon, typical
   of autotrophic shade leaves, is fixed. It is therefore suggested that
   these orchids are predominantly autotrophic. As an exception, however,
   Limodorum abortivum, a co-occurring orchid in the examined habitat, is
   unable to photosynthesize at rates compatible with autotrophy. At the
   low light intensity experienced in the understory habitat all orchids
   exhibited a similar quantum yield, but photosynthesis of Dactylorhiza
   saccifera and Cephalanthera longifolia was stimulated by light
   intensities higher than ambient, indicating that these species may
   better use sunflecks reaching the understory vegetation. Photosynthesis
   of all orchids, including Limodorum, positively responded to increasing
   CO2 concentration and temperature. Whether this will lead to a larger
   photosynthetic carbon fixation because of present and future climate
   change needs to be assessed with long-term experiments also including
   the impacts of climate on mychorrizal activity and host plants.},

   lamps (130 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)) and 25 degrees C air temperature. High
   CO2 concentration surrounding vessels (about 1200 mu l.l(-1), Vco(2))
   was applied through experiments. No difference was measured in shoot and
   root dry weight, total leaf area, and CO2 and light saturated rate of
   photosynthesis between plantlets in treatments V and Vco(2) grown in the
   ventilative vessels. Total dry weight, total leaf area, and maximum
   photosynthesis of the in vitro plantlets grown in V increased up to
   about 4, 2, and 2 times, respectively, greater than those grown in C.
   Also there were significant increases in both chlorophyll and total
   soluble protein contents in leaves of the plantlets in treatment V
   compared with the plantlets in treatment C with positive correlations
   between maximum photosynthesis and both chlorophyll and total soluble
   protein contents. Promoting growth of the in vitro plantlets under
   ventilative conditions may be result of the enhanced photosynthetic late
   in photoautotrophy because of the relieved CO2 starvation for the in
   vitro plantlets during photoperiod. Cauliflower mixotrophic plantlets in
   vitro grew rapidly and enhanced photosynthetic rate under ventilative
   culture conditions and these improvements of growth and photosynthesis
   were due to the increase in CO2 concentration surrounding vessels.},

Abstract = {A CO2 assay circuit adapted to in vitro culture was designed to
   investigate CO2 exchanges in test tube-grown Vitis rupestris plantlets. 
   The CO2 concentration of the air in culture tubes was measured by
   injection of samples in the open circuit.  It was observed under the
   culture conditions used that the CO2 content stabilized during the light
   phase at 3 times the CO2 compensation point.
   Measurements of dark respiration under closed circuit conditions at
   every two-hour interval during the night did not reveal any limiting by
   lack of the substrate under mixotrophic culture conditions.  A
   mathematical model of the influence of ambient CO2 concentration on net
   CO2 uptake rates under closed circuit conditions was devised and used to
   compare net photosynthesis at different lighting levels.  Measurement of
   CO2 evolution into CO2-free air under open circuit conditions revealed a
   postillumination burst characteristic of photorespiration which
   increased with the temperature.},

Abstract = {A warmer ocean will change plankton physiological rates, alter plankton
   community composition, and in turn affect ecosystem functions, such as
   primary production, recycling, and carbon export. To predict how
   temperature changes affect plankton community dynamics and function, we
   developed a mechanistic trait-based model of unicellular plankton
   (auto-hetero-mixotrophic protists and bacteria). Temperature
   dependencies are specifically implemented on cellular process rather
   than at the species level. As the uptake of resources and metabolic
   processes have different temperature dependencies, changes in the
   thermal environment will favor organisms with different investments in
   processes such as photosynthesis and biosynthesis. The precise level of
   investments, however, is conditional on the limiting process and is
   ultimately determined dynamically by competition and predation within
   the emergent community of the water column. We show how an increase in
   temperature can intensify nutrient limitation by altering organisms'
   interactions, and reduce relative cell-size in the community. Further,
   we anticipate that a combination of temperature and resource limitation
   reduces ecosystem efficiency at capturing carbon due to strengthening of
   the microbial loop. By explicitly representing the effects of
   temperature on traits responsible for growth, we demonstrate how changes
   on the individual level can be scaled up to trends at the ecosystem
   level, helping to discern direct from indirect effects of temperature on
   natural plankton communities.},

Title = {Compensatory Transcriptional Response of <i>Fischerella thermalis</i> to
   Thermal Damage of the Photosynthetic Electron Transfer Chain},
Journal = {MOLECULES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Key organisms in the environment, such as oxygenic photosynthetic
   primary producers (photosynthetic eukaryotes and cyanobacteria), are
   responsible for fixing most of the carbon globally. However, they are
   affected by environmental conditions, such as temperature, which in turn
   affect their distribution. Globally, the cyanobacterium Fischerella
   thermalis is one of the main primary producers in terrestrial hot
   springs with thermal gradients up to 60 degrees C, but the mechanisms by
   which F. thermalis maintains its photosynthetic activity at these high
   temperatures are not known. In this study, we used molecular approaches
   and bioinformatics, in addition to photophysiological analyses, to
   determine the genetic activity associated with the energy metabolism of
   F. thermalis both in situ and in high-temperature (40 degrees C to 65
   degrees C) cultures. Our results show that photosynthesis of F.
   thermalis decays with temperature, while increased transcriptional
   activity of genes encoding photosystem II reaction center proteins, such
   as PsbA (D1), could help overcome thermal damage at up to 60 degrees C.
   We observed that F. thermalis tends to lose copies of the standard G4 D1
   isoform while maintaining the recently described D1(INT) isoform,
   suggesting a preference for photoresistant isoforms in response to the
   thermal gradient. The transcriptional activity and metabolic
   characteristics of F. thermalis, as measured by metatranscriptomics,
   further suggest that carbon metabolism occurs in parallel with
   photosynthesis, thereby assisting in energy acquisition under high
   temperatures at which other photosynthetic organisms cannot survive.
   This study reveals that, to cope with the harsh conditions of hot
   springs, F. thermalis has several compensatory adaptations, and provides
   emerging evidence for mixotrophic metabolism as being potentially
   relevant to the thermotolerance of this species. Ultimately, this work
   increases our knowledge about thermal adaptation strategies of
   cyanobacteria.},

Title = {Complementary ecophysiological strategies combine to facilitate survival
   in the hostile conditions of a deep chlorophyll maximum},
Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {169},
Number = {3},
Pages = {609-622},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In the deep, cooler layers of clear, nutrient-poor, stratified water
   bodies, phytoplankton often accumulate to form a thin band or ``deep
   chlorophyll maximum{''} (DCM) of ecological importance. Under such
   conditions, these photosynthetic microorganisms may be close to their
   physiological compensation points and to the boundaries of their
   ecological tolerance. To grow and survive any resulting energy
   limitation, DCM species are thought to exhibit highly specialised or
   flexible acclimation strategies. In this study, we investigated several
   of the adaptable ecophysiological strategies potentially employed by one
   such species, Chlamydomonas acidophila: a motile, unicellular,
   phytoplanktonic flagellate that often dominates the DCM in stratified,
   acidic lakes. Physiological and behavioural responses were measured in
   laboratory experiments and were subsequently related to field
   observations. Results showed moderate light compensation points for
   photosynthesis and growth at 22A degrees C, relatively low maintenance
   costs, a behavioural preference for low to moderate light, and a
   decreased compensation point for photosynthesis at 8A degrees C. Even
   though this flagellated alga exhibited a physiologically mediated diel
   vertical migration in the field, migrating upwards slightly during the
   day, the ambient light reaching the DCM was below compensation points,
   and so calculations of daily net photosynthetic gain showed that
   survival by purely autotrophic means was not possible. Results suggested
   that strategies such as low-light acclimation, small-scale directed
   movements towards light, a capacity for mixotrophic growth, acclimation
   to low temperature, in situ exposure to low O-2, high CO2 and high P
   concentrations, and an avoidance of predation, could combine to help
   overcome this energetic dilemma and explain the occurrence of the DCM.
   Therefore, corroborating the deceptive ecophysiological complexity of
   this and similar organisms, only a suite of complementary strategies can
   facilitate the survival of C. acidophila in this DCM.},

Abstract = {Effect of suppression of the source activity on some physiological
   characteristics of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L., cv. Mironovskaya
   808) was studied on plants grown in water culture. The plants were
   examined at the mixotrophic stage of growth period, during their
   transition from vegetative state to relative dormancy in autumn. The
   average temperature over 10 days of the experiment was 6 degrees C at
   9-h photoperiod and illuminance of 8-20 klx. The source strength was
   suppressed successively with a series of treatments: intact control
   plants (V1); plants with the seed endosperm removed (V2); plants with
   photosynthesis inhibited (V3); plants with the seed endosperm removed
   and photosynthesis inhibited (V4); plants with the seed endosperm
   removed, photosynthesis inhibited, and the root nutrient medium replaced
   with distilled water (V5). On the 6th-10th day of the experiment, the
   relative growth rate (RGR) was determined from dry weight increments. At
   the same time, the distribution of biomass among organs, the CO2
   exchange rates (photosynthesis and dark respiration), the content and
   proportions of sugars (sucrose, glucose, and fructose), the total
   content of phenolic compounds and flavonoids, the index of membrane
   stability (IMS) in leaves, and frost hardiness of plants were measured.
   Frost hardiness of vegetating plants was shown to be inversely related
   to RGR (R = -0.906), dark respiration rate (R = -0.789), the percentage
   of sucrose in total sugar content (R = -0.737), leaf IMS (R = -0.390),
   and the rate of apparent photosynthesis (R = -0.288); it was directly
   proportional to the content of flavonoids (R =0.973), total phenols (R =
   0.743), and sugars (R = 0.385). The role of modified source-sink
   relations in frost hardiness of vegetating plants at the stage of their
   transition to cold hardening is discussed. The differences between
   plants undergoing this transition and cold-hardened plants are
   considered, as well as the importance of phenolic compounds for the
   development of frost hardiness.},

Abstract = {Mixotrophy is a dominant metabolic strategy in ecosystems worldwide.
   Shifts in temperature (T) and light (i.e. the ultraviolet portion of
   spectrum (UVR)) are key abiotic factors that modulate the conditions
   under which an organism is able to live. However, whether the
   interaction between both drivers alters mixotrophy in a global-change
   context remains unassessed.
   To determine the T x UVR effects on relative electron transport rates,
   nonphotochemical quenching, bacterivory, and bacterial production, we
   conducted an experiment with Isochrysis galbana populations grown
   mixotrophically, which were exposed to 5 degrees C of cooling and
   warming with respect to the control (19 degrees C) with (or without) UVR
   over light-dark cycles and different timescales.
   At the beginning of the experiment, cooling inhibited the relative
   electron transport and bacterivory rates, whereas warming depressed only
   bacterivory regardless of the radiation treatment. By the end of the
   experiment, warming and UVR conditions stimulated bacterivory. These
   reduced relative electron transport rates (c. 50\% (warming) and > 70\%
   (cooling)) were offset by increased (35\%) cumulative bacterivory rates
   under warming and UVR conditions.
   We propose that mixotrophy constitutes an energy-saving and a
   compensatory mechanism to gain carbon (C) when photosynthesis is
   impaired, and highlight the need to consider the natural environmental
   changes affecting the populations when we test the impacts of
   interacting global-change drivers.},

Title = {Phytodetrital quality (C:N ratio) and temperature changes affect C and N
   cycling of the intertidal mixotrophic foraminifer <i>Haynesina
   germanica</i>},
Journal = {AQUATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Pages = {119-132},
Abstract = {The combination of lower diet quality and increased metabolic rates is
   assumed to cause cascading effects on organismic C cycling. Future
   changes in CO2 levels or terrestrial nutrient discharges in marine
   ecosystems can lead to increased phytoplankton C:N ratios relative to
   consumer C:N ratios, lowering the quality of the food source. In this
   study, we compared the single and interactive effects of diet quality
   and temperature on the feeding behavior and C and N intake and release
   of a common and abundant intertidal mixotrophic protist, the foraminifer
   Haynesina germanica. Two batches of artificially produced and dual
   isotope-labeled (C-13/N-15) chlorophyte detritus with different C:N
   ratios (5.6 and 7.1) were fed to the foraminifer at 3 different
   temperatures (15, 20, 25 degrees C). We observed a strong interactive
   effect of temperature and diet. A very strong increase in feeding rates
   was observed at 20 degrees C for the low-quality food source.
   Respiration rates of carbon derived from the low-quality diet (C:N ratio
   of 7.1) were lower than those of the high-quality diets and increased at
   25 degrees C. This indicates that a high C content of the diet might be
   of advantage in calcifying mixotrophs, since respired excess C could be
   advantageous for test calcification. Additionally, respired excess C
   could be a useful resource of CO2 for kleptoplast photosynthesis and
   functionality in the mixotrophic lifestyle of H. germanica. Further, the
   observed effects of diet and temperature could impact nutrient fluxes in
   the habitat of H. germanica, possibly leading to food-web shifts in the
   future.},

Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2010},

Abstract = {We cultivated Dinophysis acuminata, a mixotrophic dinoflagellate causing
   diarrhetic shellfish poisoning worldwide, at different temperatures by
   providing a mixotrophic ciliate Myrionecta rubra as a food source. We
   examined the effects of temperature on growth rates and monitored
   production of the toxins okadaic acid (OA), dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX1),
   and pectenotoxin-2 (PTX2) using liquid chromatography-tandem mass
   spectrometry. Cell densities of D. acuminata increased at temperatures
   of 10, 14, 18, and 22 degrees C, and the mean specific growth rates
   during the exponential growth phase were higher at higher temperatures
   (0.14 to 0.28 d(-1)). The concentration of all toxins increased as cell
   densities increased. The mean cellular PTX2 content during the
   exponential growth phase was greater at lower temperatures, but clear
   differences in the other toxin concentrations in relation to temperature
   were not observed. The cellular content of OA and DTX1 significantly
   increased during the exponential growth phase at all temperatures except
   at 10 degrees C for OA, whereas that of PTX2 did not significantly
   increase at temperatures greater than 10 degrees C. Cellular toxin
   production rates temporarily increased at or just before the end of the
   exponential growth phase at 14, 18, and 22 degrees C, and the mean rates
   for OA production over the entire incubation period were higher at
   higher temperatures. Our results indicate that increasing temperature
   generally stimulates toxin production in D. acuminata populations due to
   an increase in cell density, but cellular content and production rates
   of OA and PTX2 in response to temperature differ and are influenced by
   growth phase.},

Abstract = {Mixotrophic protists combine phagotrophy and phototrophy within a single
   cell. Greater phagotrophic activity could reinforce the bypass of carbon
   (C) flux through the bacteria-mixotroph link and thus lead to a more
   efficient transfer of C and other nutrients to the top of the trophic
   web. Determining how foreseeable changes in temperature and UVR affect
   mixotrophic trade-offs in favor of one or the other nutritional
   strategy, along the mixotrophic gradient, is key to understanding the
   fate of carbon and mineral nutrients in the aquatic ecosystem. Our two
   main hypotheses were: (i) that increased warming and UVR will divert
   metabolism toward phagotrophy, and (ii) that the magnitude of this shift
   will vary according to the organism's position along the mixotrophic
   gradient. To test these hypotheses, we used two protists (Isochrysis
   galbana and Chromulina sp.) located in different positions on the
   mixotrophic gradient, subjecting them to the action of temperature and
   of UVR and their interaction. Our results showed that the joint action
   of these two factors increased the primary production:bacterivory ratio
   and stoichiometric values (N:P ratio) close to Redfield's ratio.
   Therefore, temperature and UVR shifted the metabolism of both organisms
   toward greater phototrophy regardless of the original position of the
   organism on the mixotrophic gradient. Weaker phagotrophic activity could
   cause a less efficient transfer of C to the top of trophic webs.},

Title = {Interactive effects of light, CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature on growth

   <i>Karlodinium veneficum</i>},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},

Month = {OCT 27},
Abstract = {There is little information on the impacts of climate change on resource
   partitioning for mixotrophic phytoplankton. Here, we investigated the
   hypothesis that light interacts with temperature and CO2 to affect
   changes in growth and cellular carbon and nitrogen content of the
   mixotrophic dinoflagellate, Karlodinium veneficum, with increasing
   cellular carbon and nitrogen content under low light conditions and
   increased growth under high light conditions. Using a multifactorial
   design, the interactive effects of light, temperature and CO2 were
   investigated on K. veneficum at ambient temperature and CO2 levels (25
   degrees C, 375 ppm), high temperature (30 degrees C, 375 ppm CO2), high
   CO2 (30 degrees C, 750 ppm CO2), or a combination of both high
   temperature and CO2 (30 degrees C, 750 ppm CO2) at low light intensities
   (LL: 70 pmol photons m(-2) s(-2)) and light-saturated conditions (HL:
   140 pmol photons m(-2) s(-2)). Results revealed significant interactions
   between light and temperature for all parameters. Growth rates were not
   significantly different among LL treatments, but increased significantly
   with temperature or a combination of elevated temperature and CO2 under
   HL compared to ambient conditions. Particulate carbon and nitrogen
   content increased in response to temperature or a combination of
   elevated temperature and CO2 under LL conditions, but significantly
   decreased in HL cultures exposed to elevated temperature and/or CO2
   compared to ambient conditions at HL. Significant increases in C:N
   ratios were observed only in the combined treatment under LL, suggesting
   a synergistic effect of temperature and CO2 on carbon assimilation,
   while increases in C:N under HL were driven only by an increase in CO2.
   Results indicate light-driven variations in growth and nutrient
   acquisition strategies for K. veneficum that may benefit this species
   under anticipated climate change conditions (elevated light, temperature
   and pCO(2)) while also affecting trophic transfer efficiency during
   blooms of this species.},

Abstract = {Takayama helix is a mixotrophic dinoflagellate that can feed on diverse
   algal prey. We explored the effects of light intensity and water
   temperature, two important physical factors, on its autotrophic and
   mixotrophic growth rates when fed on Alexandrium minutum CCMP1888. Both
   the autotrophic and mixotrophic growth rates and ingestion rates of T.
   helix on A. minutum were significantly affected by photon flux density.
   Positive growth rates of T. helix at 6-58 mu mol photons center dot
   m(-2) center dot s(-1) were observed in both the autotrophic (maximum
   rate = 0.2 center dot d(-1)) and mixotrophic modes (0.4 center dot
   d(-1)). Of course, it did not grow both autotrophically and
   mixotrophically in complete darkness. At >= 247 mu mol photons center
   dot m(-2) center dot s(-1), the autotrophic growth rates were negative
   (i.e., photoinhibition), but mixotrophy turned these negative rates to
   positive. Both autotrophic and mixotrophic growth and ingestion rates
   were significantly affected by water temperature. Under both autotrophic
   and mixotrophic conditions, it grew at 15-28 degrees C, but not at <= 10
   or 30 degrees C. Therefore, both light intensity and temperature are
   critical factors affecting the survival and growth of T. helix.},

Title = {Effects of light intensity and temperature on growth and ingestion rates
   of the mixotrophic dinoflagellate Alexandrium pohangense},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {166},

Abstract = {The newly described phototrophic dinoflagellate Alexandrium pohangense,
   APPH1409, fed only on the dinoflagellate Margalefidinium polykrikoides
   among 16 potential algal prey species tested. To explore the
   ecophysiology of A. pohangense, its growth and ingestion rates with and
   without added M. polykrikoides prey were determined as a function of
   light intensity (0-346 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) and temperature
   (10-35 degrees C). Both the autotrophic and mixotrophic growth rates of
   A. pohangense fed on M. polykrikoides were significantly affected by
   light intensity. In the darkness, A. pohangense did not grow under
   either mixotrophic or phototrophic conditions. The compensation light
   intensity for the growth of A. pohangense under mixotrophic conditions
   (2.7 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) was lower than that under autotrophic
   conditions (11.7 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)). Growth inhibition due to
   light stress did not occur at the tested light intensities. A.
   pohangense grew between 15 and 30 degrees C, but did not grow at 10
   degrees C or32 degrees C. Both the autotrophic and mixotrophic growth
   rates of A. pohangense fed on M. polykrikoides were also significantly
   affected by temperature. At the same light intensity or temperature, the
   mixotrophic growth rate of A. pohangense was generally considerably
   greater than the autotrophic growth rate, with a few exceptions.
   Therefore, light intensity, water temperature, and prey accessibility
   may affect the population dynamics of this species.},

Title = {Modeling the metabolic evolution of mixotrophic phytoplankton in
   response to rising ocean surface temperatures},
Journal = {BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 18},
Abstract = {Background Climate change is expected to lead to warming in ocean
   surface temperatures which will have unequal effects on the rates of
   photosynthesis and heterotrophy. As a result of this changing metabolic
   landscape, directional phenotypic evolution will occur, with
   implications that cascade up to the ecosystem level. While mixotrophic
   phytoplankton, organisms that combine photosynthesis and heterotrophy to
   meet their energetic and nutritional needs, are expected to become more
   heterotrophic with warmer temperatures due to heterotrophy increasing at
   a faster rate than photosynthesis, it is unclear how evolution will
   influence how these organisms respond to warmer temperatures. In this
   study, we used adaptive dynamics to model the consequences of
   temperature-mediated increases in metabolic rates for the evolution of
   mixotrophic phytoplankton, focusing specifically on phagotrophic
   mixotrophs. Results We find that mixotrophs tend to evolve to become
   more reliant on phagotrophy as temperatures rise, leading to reduced
   prey abundance through higher grazing rates. However, if prey abundance
   becomes too low, evolution favors greater reliance on photosynthesis.
   These responses depend upon the trade-off that mixotrophs experience
   between investing in photosynthesis and phagotrophy. Mixotrophs with a
   convex trade-off maintain mixotrophy over the greatest range of
   temperatures; evolution in these ``generalist{''} mixotrophs was found
   to exacerbate carbon cycle impacts, with evolving mixotrophs exhibiting
   increased sensitivity to rising temperature. Conclusions Our results
   show that mixotrophs may respond more strongly to climate change than
   predicted by phenotypic plasticity alone due to evolutionary shifts in
   metabolic investment. However, the type of metabolic trade-off
   experienced by mixotrophs as well as ecological feedback on prey
   abundance may ultimately limit the extent of evolutionary change along
   the heterotrophy-phototrophy spectrum.},

Abstract = {Mixotrophs, organisms that combine photosynthesis and heterotrophy to
   gain energy, play an important role in global biogeochemical cycles.
   Metabolic theory predicts that mixotrophs will become more heterotrophic
   with rising temperatures, potentially creating a positive feedback loop
   that accelerates carbon dioxide accumulation in the atmosphere. Studies
   testing this theory have focused on phenotypically plastic (short-term,
   non-evolutionary) thermal responses of mixotrophs. However, as small
   organisms with short generation times and large population sizes,
   mixotrophs may rapidly evolve in response to climate change. Here, we
   present data from a 3-year experiment quantifying the evolutionary
   response of two mixotrophic nanoflagellates to temperature. We found
   evidence for adaptive evolution (increased growth rates in evolved
   relative to acclimated lineages) in the obligately phototrophic strain,
   but not in the facultative phototroph. All lineages showed trends of
   increased carbon use efficiency, flattening of thermal reaction norms,
   and a return to homeostatic gene expression. Generally, mixotrophs
   evolved reduced photosynthesis and higher grazing with increased
   temperatures, suggesting that evolution may act to exacerbate
   mixotrophs' effects on global carbon cycling.},

Title = {Fatty acid patterns in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> sp as a marker for
   nutritional regimes and temperature under extremely acidic conditions},
Journal = {MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1},
Pages = {78-89},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Fatty acid profiles were used to characterize nutritional pathways in
   Chlamydomonas sp. isolated from an acidic mining lake (pH 2.7).
   Surprisingly, profiles of Chlamydomonas sp. grown. in the lab under
   photoautotrophic, mixotrophic, and heterotrophic conditions at in situ
   deep strata lake water temperatures (8degreesC) were very similar,
   polyunsaturated fatty acids including alpha-linolenic acid (18:3omega3)
   and 16:40 along with palmitic acid (16:0) being most abundant.
   Therefore, heterotrophic growth of Chlamydomonas sp. at low temperatures
   can result in high concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids, as
   previously only described for some psychrophilic bacteria. By contrast,
   the cultivation of isolated Chlamydomonas sp. at 20degreesC, reflecting
   surface water temperatures, provided fatty acid patterns characteristic
   of the nutrition strategy applied: the concentration of polyunsaturated
   fatty acids decreased when the growth pathway changed from
   photoautotrophic via mixotrophic to heterotrophic. Total fatty acid
   concentration also diminished in this order. Principal component
   analysis confirmed the significance of FA profiling to mirror
   nutritional pathways. Lake-water analysis revealed low concentrations of
   dissolved organic carbon, mainly consisting of polymeric fulvic acids
   that are unable to support heterotrophic growth of Chlamydomonas sp.
   Polymeric fulvic acids present in the deeper strata of the lake turned
   out to be formed in situ on the basis of organic monomers including
   reduced sulfur-containing ones, as revealed by thermochemolysis and
   pyrolysis. Growth of Chlamydomonas sp. in the deep chlorophyll maximum
   is therefore assumed to mainly result from photosynthesis, despite very
   low photon densities. Phytol-including metabolites proved to be
   significant biomarkers to indicate the nutritional pathway of
   Chlamydomonas sp. alpha, omega-Dicarboxylic acids-light-induced
   degradation products of unsaturated fatty acids-appeared to be good
   indicators of photooxidative alterations to the algal species under
   study.},

Title = {Competition between phytoplankton and mixotrophs leads to metabolic
   character displacement},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {481},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {While plankton are often characterized by metabolism as either
   phototrophic primary producers or het-erotrophic consumers, many
   actually combine photosynthesis and phagotrophy within a single cell.
   These ``mixotrophic{''}plankton, which play an important biogeochemical
   role in marine food webs, exhibit diverse metabolic strategies with
   varied contributions from photosynthesis and phagotrophy. Mixotrophs
   co-exist with specialist phototrophs and heterotrophs, competing for
   shared resources; yet we do not know how this competition alters a
   mixotroph's metabolic strategy or impacts biogeochemistry. We
   constructed a mathematical model to simulate the dynamics of a
   planktonic community which consists of mixotrophs and their specialist
   phototrophic competitor, phytoplankton. Our simulation demonstrates how
   the presence of competing phytoplankton causes metabolic character
   displacement, shifting mixotrophs to a more het-erotrophic niche. We
   find that the displacement is affected by various environmental and
   physiological factors. For example, this displacement effect is
   temperature dependent, suggesting a link between community-level
   competitive mechanisms and global climate change. The proposed model
   therefore may be used to develop a more comprehensive analysis of the
   competition between constitutive mixotrophs and specialist phototrophs
   or heterotrophs. Our model also provides a mathematical framework for
   predicting constitutive mixotroph survival in the context of global
   warming.},

Abstract = {Bacteriovorous protozoa harboring symbiotic algae are abundant in
   aquatic ecosystems, yet despite a recent interest in protozoan
   bacterivory, the influence of light on their ingestion rates has not
   been investigated. In this study, Paramecium bursaria containing
   endosymbiotic Chlorella was tested for the effect of light on its
   ingestion rate. P. bursaria was grown for 4 to 6 days under five
   different light fluxes ranging from 1 to 90 microeinsteins s-1 m-2.
   Ingestion rates were determined by using 0.77-mu-m-diameter fluorescent
   microspheres. 4',6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride-labeled
   Enterobacter cloacae was used in one experiment to confirm differences
   in uptake rates of bacteria by P. bursaria. Unlike phagotrophic
   phytoflagellates, the ciliates demonstrated different ingestion rates in
   response to different light intensities. Although symbionts contribute
   carbon to their host via photosynthesis, the paramecia of the present
   study fed faster after exposure to higher light intensities, whereas
   their aposymbiotic counterparts (lacking endosymbionts) were unaffected.
   Light-induced changes in ingestion rates were not immediate, but
   corresponded to the period of time required for endosymbiont populations
   to change significantly. This strongly suggests that the symbionts,
   stimulated by higher light levels, may dictate the feeding rates of
   their hosts. Thus, light, apart from temperature, may influence the
   impact of certain protists on natural bacteria and may affect
   laboratory-based determinations of protistan feeding rates.},

Abstract = {Intricate networks of single-celled eukaryotes (protists) dominate
   carbon flow in the ocean. Their growth, demise, and interactions with
   other microorganisms drive the fluxes of biogeochemical elements through
   marine ecosystems. Mixotrophic protists are capable of both
   photosynthesis and ingestion of prey and are dominant components of
   open-ocean planktonic communities. Yet the role of mixotrophs in
   elemental cycling is obscured by their capacity to act as primary
   producers or heterotrophic consumers depending on factors that remain
   largely uncharacterized. Here, we develop and apply a machine learning
   model that predicts the in situ trophic mode of aquatic protists based
   on their patterns of gene expression. This approach leverages a public
   collection of protist transcriptomes as a training set to identify a
   subset of gene families whose transcriptional profiles predict trophic
   mode. We applied our model to nearly 100 metatranscriptomes obtained
   during two oceanographic cruises in the North Pacific and found
   community-level and population-specific evidence that abundant
   open-ocean mixotrophic populations shift their predominant mode of
   nutrient and carbon acquisition in response to natural gradients in
   nutrient supply and sea surface temperature. Metatranscriptomic data
   from ship-board incubation experiments revealed that abundant
   mixotrophic prymnesiophytes from the oligotrophic North Pacific
   subtropical gyre rapidly remodeled their transcriptome to enhance
   photosynthesis when supplied with limiting nutrients. Coupling this
   approach with experiments designed to reveal the mechanisms driving
   mixotroph physiology provides an avenue toward understanding the ecology
   of mixotrophy in the natural environment.},

Title = {Mixotrophy in a Local Strain of <i>Nannochloropsis</i> <i>granulata</i>

Abstract = {A local strain of Nannochloropsis granulata (Ng) has been reported as
   the most productive microalgal strain in terms of both biomass yield and
   lipid content when cultivated in photobioreactors that simulate the
   light and temperature conditions during the summer on the west coast of
   Sweden. To further increase the biomass and the biotechnological
   potential of this strain in these conditions, mixotrophic growth (i.e.,
   the simultaneous use of photosynthesis and respiration) with glycerol as
   an external carbon source was investigated in this study and compared
   with phototrophic growth that made use of air enriched with 1-2\% CO2.
   The addition of either glycerol or CO2-enriched air stimulated the
   growth of Ng and theproduction of high-value long-chain polyunsaturated
   fatty acids (EPA) as well as the carotenoid canthaxanthin. Bioassays in
   human prostate cell lines indicated the highest antitumoral activity for
   Ng extracts and fractions from mixotrophic conditions. Metabolomics
   detected betaine lipids specifically in the bioactive fractions,
   suggesting their involvement in the observed antitumoral effect. Genes
   related to autophagy were found to be upregulated by the most bioactive
   fraction, suggesting a possible therapeutic target against prostate
   cancer progression. Taken together, our results suggest that the local
   Ng strain can be cultivated mixotrophically in summer conditions on the
   west coast of Sweden for the production of high-value biomass containing
   antiproliferative compounds, carotenoids, and EPA.},

Abstract = {We examined long-term phytoplankton data records for four oligotrophic
   boreal lakes situated in the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA), western
   Ontario, for responses to climatic change. ELA experienced a cyclical
   wet-dry-wet pattern from 1968 to 1998, with the early 1970s and 1990s
   having above-average precipitation and the 1980s being a period of
   drought with a 2 degrees C increase in air temperature. During this
   drought, the length of ice-free season, duration of stratification,
   depth of the euphotic zone, and light extinction increased while
   precipitation and nutrient inputs to the lakes decreased. Phytoplankton
   assemblages of four study lakes were temporally coherent. During the
   drought, phytoplankton biomass and the number of phytoplankton species
   increased despite decreased nutrient inputs. There was a noticeable
   shift in species composition to greater abundances of dinoflagellates
   and large chrysophytes-mixotrophic species capable of cycling through
   the deeper, lower light, high-nutrient waters, presumably to consume
   bacteria as an alternative to autotrophic production. These species have
   slow turnover times; therefore, suspended nutrients were held in the
   water column for a longer period of time. Phytoplankton photosynthesis
   was less responsive.},

Title = {A three-dimensional mixotrophic model of<i> Karlodinium</i><i>
   veneficum</i> blooms for a eutrophic estuary},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {113},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Blooms of dinoflagellate Karlodinium veneficum are widely distributed in
   estuarine and coastal waters and have been found to cause fish kills
   worldwide. K. veneficum has a mixed nutritional mode and relies on both
   photosynthesis and phagotrophy for growth; it is a mixotroph. Here, a
   model of mixotrophic growth of K. veneficum (MIXO) was developed,
   calibrated with previously-reported laboratory physiological data, and
   subsequently embedded in a 3D-coupled hydrodynamic (ROMS)-biogeochemical
   (RCA) model of eutrophic Chesapeake Bay, USA. The resulting
   ROMS-RCA-MIXO model was applied in hindcast mode to investigate seasonal
   and spatial distributions. Simulations showed that K. veneficum blooms
   occurred during June-August and were confined to the upper and middle
   Bay, consistent with long-term field observations. Autotrophic growth
   dominated in spring but heterotrophic growth dominated during the
   summer. The number of prey ingested by K. veneficum varied from 0.1 to
   0.6 day(-1) and the food vacuole content reached up to 50\% of the core
   mixotroph biomass. The ingestion rate increased with prey density and
   also when P:N ratio fell below similar to 0.03 (N:P similar to 33),
   indicating that K. veneficum only switched to mixotrophic feeding in
   P-deficient waters when sufficient prey were available; this occurred
   during the summer months. The digestion rate increased with both the
   food vacuole content and temperature. The modeling analysis affirms K.
   veneficum as a phagotrophic `alga' which is primarily photosynthetic but
   switches to mixotrophic feeding under nutrient deficient conditions.},

Abstract = {An error in our original work prompts a revisitation of factors
   constraining photoautotrophic plankton growth rates (mu(max)).
   Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate Carboxylase-Oxygenase does not itself provide
   that constraint, but we identify other factors that result in our
   previously suggested value of similar to 2 doublings per day still
   likely being representative of the maximum for most photoautotrophs.
   mu(max) likely evolves to balance the advantage of possessing a high
   competitive value while minimizing the stresses incurred when the
   organism is incapable of routinely achieving a higher mu(max) due to
   various limiting factors. Organisms with extreme high mu(max) are thus
   expected to grow under conditions that provide the necessary environment
   (stable pH, non-limiting nutrients and light) for sufficient time that
   the evolution of higher mu(max) becomes advantageous. Conditions in
   nature allowing the evolution of higher mu(max) include the exploitation
   of an exceptional opportunity and then entering stasis (e.g. desert
   microalgae), or a situation where high grazing pressures match high
   phytoplankton growth, thus maintaining non-limiting nutrient and light
   conditions. The latter, however, conflicts with the paradox of
   enrichment, as only under resource limitation would the necessary
   stability be attained in the predator-prey dynamic. Ultimately, ecology,
   not biophysics, constrains phototroph mu(max).},

Abstract = {Large amplitude internal waves (LAIW) cause frequent and severe changes
   in the physico-chemical environment of Andaman Sea coral reefs and are a
   potentially important source of disturbance for corals. To explore the
   coral response to LAIW, prey capture disposition and photosynthesis were
   investigated in relation to changes in seawater temperature, pH, flow
   speed and food availability in LAIW simulation studies under controlled
   laboratory conditions, using Porites lutea as a model organism. Although
   food presence stimulated polyp expansion, we found an overriding effect
   of low temperature (19 degrees C) causing retraction of the coral polyps
   into their calices, particularly when pH was altered concomitantly.
   Decreases in pH alone, however, caused the expansion of the polyps. The
   exposure history of the colonies played a crucial role in coral
   responses: prior field exposure to LAIW yielded lower retraction levels
   than in LAIW-inexperienced corals, suggesting acclimatization. Low
   temperature (19 degrees C) exposure did not seem to influence the
   photosynthetic performance, but LAIW-experienced corals showed higher
   values of maximum dark-adapted quantum yield (F-v/F-m) of photosystem II
   than LAIW-inexperienced controls. Collectively, these data suggest that
   P. lutea, the dominant hermatypic coral in the Andaman Sea, can
   acclimatize to extreme changes in its abiotic environment by modulating
   its mixotrophic nutrition, through polyp expansion and potential
   feeding, as well as its photosynthetic efficiency.},

Abstract = {The results from a winter field study in 2009-2010 in Lake Vanajanselka
   are presented. This lake is shallow, eutrophic, and annually ice-covered
   on average for 5 months. The ice sheet was 41-55 cm thick at the annual
   maximum, consisting of snow-ice and congelation ice. The e-folding depth
   of light intensity was 50-100 cm for congelation ice and 5-10 cm for
   snow. The water body had a 4-m thick upper mixed layer and lower
   continuously stratified layer. Fall cooling process was crucial to
   determine the temperature of the lower layer at freeze-up, anything
   within 0-4 degrees C. Oxygen concentration decreased in winter,
   especially close to the bottom sediments, and carbon dioxide
   concentration increased due to respiration activity. Phytoplankton
   production and biomass level were low or very low and, therefore,
   heterotrophic and mixotrophic species were abundant. Oxygen depletion in
   the hypolimnium had several chemical and ecological consequences, such
   as release of phosphorus from the bottom sediments. In spring, just
   before the ice-out, photosynthesis was at a high level beneath the ice
   due to improved light conditions and started to elevate the oxygen
   concentration in the topmost water layer.},

Title = {Eco-Evolutionary Perspectives on Mixoplankton},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {Mixotrophy, i.e., the capability of both phototrophy and phagotrophy
   within a single organism, is a prominent trophic mode in aquatic
   ecosystems. Mixotrophic strategies can be highly advantageous when
   feeding or photosynthesis alone does not sustain metabolic needs. In the
   current review, we discuss the functional types of mixotrophic marine
   protists (herein mixoplankton) within the context of evolution.
   Permanent plastids have been established in large due to gene transfer
   from prey and/or endosymbionts to the host cell. In some kleptoplastidic
   mixoplankton, prior gene transfers and active transcription of plastid
   related genes in the host can help maintain and extend retention of the
   current kleptoplast. In addition to kleptoplasts, the prey nucleus is
   also sometimes retained and actively transcribed to help maintain and
   even replicate the kleptoplasts. Endosymbiotic relations vary
   considerably in the extent to which hosts affect symbionts. For example,
   some endosymbionts are heavily modified to increase photosynthetic
   efficiency, or are controlled in their cell division. It can be proposed
   that many kleptoplasts and endosymbionts are in fact en route to
   becoming permanent plastids. Conditions such as increased temperature
   and limiting nutrients seem to favor phagotrophy in mixoplankton.
   However, responses of mixoplankton to changing environmental conditions
   like light irradiance, temperature, nutrient, and prey availability are
   variable and species-specific. Studying mixotrophs with temporary
   plastids could elucidate past and future evolutionary mechanisms and
   dynamics of processes such as phagotrophy and the establishment of
   (secondary) permanent plastids.},

Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Microalgae fuel food webs and biogeochemical cycles of key elements in
   the ocean. What determines microalgal dominance in the ocean is a
   long-standing question. Red tide distribution data (spanning 1990 to
   2019) show that mixotrophic dinoflagellates, capable of photosynthesis
   and predation together, were responsible for similar to 40\% of the
   species forming red tides globally. Counterintuitively, the species with
   low or moderate growth rates but diverse prey including diatoms caused
   red tides globally. The ability of these dinoflagellates to trade off
   growth for prey diversity is another genetic factor critical to
   formation of red tides across diverse ocean conditions. This finding has
   profound implications for explaining the global dominance of particular
   microalgae, their key eco-evolutionary strategy, and prediction of
   harmful red tide outbreaks.},

Abstract = {1. The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas acidophila accumulates in a
   thin phytoplankton layer in the hypolimnion (deep chlorophyll maximum,
   DCM) of an extremely acidic lake (Lake 111, pH 2.6, Lusatia, Germany),
   in which the underwater light spectrum is distorted and red-shifted.
   2. Chlamydomonas acidophila exhibited a significantly higher absorption
   efficiency and a higher cellular chlorophyll b content when incubated in
   the red shifted underwater light of Lake 111 than in a typical,
   blue-green dominated, light spectrum.
   3. Chlamydomonas acidophila has excellent low light acclimation
   properties (increased chlorophyll b content, increased oxygen yield and
   a low light saturation point for photosynthesis) that support survival
   of the species in the low light climate of the DCM.
   4. In situ acclimation to the DCM under low light and temperature
   decreased maximum photosynthetic rate in autotrophic C. acidophila
   cultures, whereas the presence of glucose under these conditions
   enhanced photosynthetic efficiency and capacity.
   5. The adaptive abilities of C. acidophila to light and temperature
   shown in this study, in combination with the absence of potent
   competitors because of low lake pH, most probably enable the unusual
   dominance of the green alga in the DCM of Lake 111.},

Title = {Experimental and Modeling Analysis of <i>Synechocystis</i> sp PCC 6803

Year = {2012},
Volume = {22},

Pages = {71-82},
Abstract = {Background/Aims: The influence of different parameters such as
   temperature, irradiance, nitrate concentration, pH, and an external
   carbon source on Synechocystis PCC 6803 growth was evaluated. Methods:
   4.5-ml cuvettes containing 2 ml of culture, a high-throughput system
   equivalent to batch cultures, were used with gas exchange ensured by the
   use of a Parafilm (TM) cover. The effect of the different variables on
   maximum growth was assessed by a multi-way statistical analysis.
   Results: Temperature and pH were identified as the key factors. It was
   observed that Synechocystis cells have a strong influence on the
   external pH. The optimal growth temperature was 33 degrees C while
   light-saturating conditions were reached at 40 mu E.m(-2.)s(-1).
   Conclusion: It was demonstrated that Synechocystis exhibits a marked
   difference in behavior between autotrophic and glucose-based mixotrophic
   conditions, and that nitrate concentrations did not have a significant
   influence, probably due to endogenous nitrogen reserves. Furthermore, a
   dynamic metabolic model of Synechocystis photosynthesis was developed to
   gain insights on the underlying mechanism enabling this cyanobacterium
   to control the levels of external pH. The model showed a coupled effect
   between the increase of the pH and ATP production which in turn allows a
   higher carbon fixation rate. Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Title = {High abundances and negligible grazing during winter by the mixotrophic

Journal = {FOTTEA},

Volume = {23},

Pages = {201-207},
Abstract = {Grazing on bacteria by planktonic organisms is a channel for the
   biological transfer of organic matter through the aquatic food web. Much
   attention has been given to the importance of heterotrophic
   nanoflagellates and ciliates as primary grazers of bacteria. However,
   the prevalence of phagotrophy by phytoplankton across many environments
   emphasizes a need to include mixotrophy in studies of the protistan food
   web. Few studies have addressed the seasonal dynamics nor grazing
   activity of mixotrophs in freshwater environments, especially those that
   extend below surface waters. The goal of this work was to examine
   temporal patterns in mixotroph abundance and taxon-specific bacterivory,
   with a focus on Dinobryon. Results shown here support our general
   predictions of increased bacterivory by Dinobryon where a low light and
   nutrient environment may promote grazing. Dinobryon spp. were
   numerically dominant members of the community under-ice in winter,
   possibly as a result of their ability to supplement photosynthesis with
   phagotrophy of bacteria in conditions of reduced irradiance and day
   length. However, daily grazing rate and associated impact on the
   bacterial community during winter were not substantial. These results
   highlight the importance of including winter sampling when an active
   community of phagotrophic phytoflagellates may play a major role in
   ecosystem functioning. Results underscore the importance of including
   measurements of grazing activity with mixotroph occurrences, as high
   abundance of Dinobryon did not align with high rates of bacterivory.},

Abstract = {The coupling of primary piggery wastewater as a culture medium with
   elevated CO2 aeration is thought to be an economically feasible option
   for the cultivation of microalgae. However, little information is
   available regarding the photosynthetic characteristics of microalgae and
   nutrient removal from wastewater at different CO2 concentrations. It was
   found that elevated CO2 aeration provided sustained growth at CO2
   concentrations ranging from 5\% to 15\% and performed best with 5\% CO2
   aeration in primary piggery wastewater for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
   growth. Photosynthesis, respiration, and nutrient uptake (total nitrogen
   and total phosphorus) were stimulated in response to CO2 enrichment,
   thus increasing nutrient uptake in primary piggery wastewater,
   particularly total nitrogen and total phosphorus. A study of
   carbon-concentrating mechanism-related gene expression revealed that the
   levels of mRNAs, such as CAH1, LCIB and HLA3, were significantly
   downregulated. This represents a possible method for the reconciliation
   of CO2-stimulated growth with mixotrophic cultivation of C. reinhardtii
   in diluted primary piggery wastewater.},

Abstract = {Cyanobacteria, or the blue-green algae as they used to be called until
   1974, are the oldest oxygenic photosynthesizers. We summarize here
   adventures with them since the early 1960s. This includes studies on
   light absorption by cyanobacteria, excitation energy transfer at room
   temperature down to liquid helium temperature, fluorescence (kinetics as
   well as spectra) and its relationship to photosynthesis, and afterglow
   (or thermoluminescence) from them. Further, we summarize experiments on
   their two-light reaction - two-pigment system, as well as the unique
   role of bicarbonate (hydrogen carbonate) on the electron-acceptor side
   of their photosystem II, PSII. This review, in addition, includes a
   discussion on the regulation of changes in phycobilins (mostly in PSII)
   and chlorophyll a (Chl a; mostly in photosystem I, PSI) under
   oscillating light, on the relationship of the slow fluorescence increase
   (the so-called S to M rise, especially in the presence of diuron) in
   minute time scale with the so-called state-changes, and on the
   possibility of limited oxygen evolution in mixotrophic PSI (minus)
   mutants, up to 30 min, in the presence of glucose. We end this review
   with a brief discussion on the position of cyanobacteria in the
   evolution of photosynthetic systems.},

Year = {2005},
Volume = {4},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This study deals with a recently found phenomenon in the northern Baltic
   Sea: the occurrence of the dinoflagellate Dinophysis acuminata in the
   deep water below the thermocline. This was first observed in July 2001
   at the station BY 15 in the Gotland Deep, where a sharp and intensive
   chlorophyll fluorescence signal was encountered at 77 m depth. The
   fluorescence peak was due to a dinoflagellate community dominated by
   Dinophysis acuminata (approximately 18 000 cells 1(-1)). The survival of
   this community was followed in laboratory incubations in low light (20
   muE m(-2) s(-1)) and low temperature (+5 degreesC). After 5 weeks
   incubation, 67-84\% of the initial cell abundance was lost, while few D.
   acuminata cells survived up to 24 weeks in the original sample. During
   the incubation, the fluorescence signal of the cells became fainter and
   the chloroplasts smaller and aggregated. On two occasions a D. acuminata
   cell was found attached to a smaller cell by a thin cytoplasm strand,
   possibly indicating mixotrophic behavior. During the following summer
   (2002), the photosynthetic efficiency of D. acuminata collected from
   thermocline layers of few stations and from the nitracline (75-80 m) at
   one station was studied in photosynthesis irradiance (P-E) incubations.
   Photosynthetic activity occurred in all populations, with differences in
   their photosynthetic carbon uptake rates. Photosynthesis of D. acuminata
   populations was saturated between 250 and 500 muE m(-2) s(-1); maximum
   cell-specific carbon uptake rates (P,,) ranged from 160-925 pg C
   cell(-1) h(-1). The P-m-rates in populations originating below the
   thermocline and in an artificially darkened population were markedly
   lower than in populations from upper water layers. The varying maximum
   photosynthetic rates of these populations may reflect their history,
   e.g. time spent in different light environments. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

   wastewater resulting in higher lipid and triacylglycerol levels for

Journal = {BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {332},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Microalgal treatment of undiluted raw piggery wastewater is challenging
   due to ammonia toxicity and a deep dark color hampering photosynthesis.
   To overcome these problems, (1) a microalga (Coelastrella sp.) was
   isolated from an ammonia-rich environment, (2) the wastewater treatment
   was divided into two steps: a heterotrophic process followed by a
   mixotrophic process, and (3) a narrower transparent photobioreactor was
   employed with higher light intensity in the mixotrophic process.
   Coelastrella sp. removed 99\% of ammonia, 92\% of chemical oxygen demand
   (COD), and 100\% of phosphorus during the 4-day process. Acetate in the
   wastewater relieved the ammonia stress on microalgae and promoted algal
   lipid and triacylglycerol productivity. Oxidative stability and
   low-temperature fluidity of triacylglycerols in lipids were improved by
   means of an altered fatty acid profile. Aside from the overall
   microalgal treatment performance, the proposed processing of piggery
   wastewater yielded a material suitable for possible production of algal
   biodiesel of better quality.},

Abstract = {In Antarctic lakes, organisms are confronted by continuous low
   temperatures as well as a poor light climate and nutrient limitation.
   Such extreme environments support truncated food webs with no fish, few
   metazoans and a dominance of microbial plankton. The key to success lies
   in entering the short Antarctic summer with actively growing
   populations. In many cases, the most successful organisms continue to
   function throughout the year. The few crustacean zooplankton remain
   active in the winter months, surviving on endogenous energy reserves
   and, in some cases, continuing development. Among the Protozoa,
   mixotrophy is an important nutritional strategy. In the extreme lakes of
   the McMurdo Dry Valleys, planktonic cryptophytes are forced to sustain a
   mixotrophic strategy and cannot survive by photosynthesis alone. The
   dependence on ingesting bacteria varies seasonally and with depth in the
   water column. In the Vestfold Hills, Pyramimonas, which dominates the
   plankton of some of the saline lakes, also resorts to mixotrophy, but
   does become entirely photosynthetic at mid-summer. Mixotrophic ciliates
   are also common and the entirely photosynthetic ciliate Mesodinium
   rubrum has a widespread distribution in the saline lakes of the Vestfold
   Hills, where it attains high concentrations. Bacteria continue to grow
   all year, showing cycles that appear to be related to the availability
   of dissolved organic carbon. In saline lakes, bacteria experience
   sub-zero temperatures for long periods of the year and have developed
   biochemical adaptations that include anti-freeze proteins, changes in
   the concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids in their membranes and
   suites of low-temperature enzymes.},

Title = {Latitudinal Variation in Plankton Traits and Ecosystem Function},
Journal = {GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Planktonic ecosystems are usually modeled in terms of autotrophic and
   heterotrophic compartments. However, the trophic strategy of unicellular
   organisms can take a range of mixotrophic strategies with both
   autotrophic and heterotrophic contributions. The dominant emerging
   strategy found in nature depends on the environment (both biotic and
   abiotic aspects) and the cell size and influences key ecosystem
   functions like trophic transfer and carbon export. Ecosystem models that
   faithfully represent this diversity of trophic strategies are lacking.
   Here we develop a trait-based model of unicellular plankton with cell
   size as the master trait and three other traits that determine trophic
   strategies: investments in photosynthesis, nutrient uptake, and
   phagotrophy. This unicellular model spans the entire auto- mixo-
   hererotrophic strategy continuum and the entire size range of
   unicellular organisms. The model reproduces observed latitudinal
   patterns in biomass, primary productivity, vertical carbon export, and
   energy transfer efficiency; all increase with increasing latitude. The
   size range of mixotrophic cells is independent of the season at low
   latitudes. At high latitudes, the dominance of pure phototrophs during
   early spring restricts mixotrophic behavior to a narrower range of cell
   sizes and with the occurrence of relatively smaller mixotrophs during
   summer. The model's ability to adapt to different environmental
   conditions, combined with its simple conceptual structure and low number
   of parameters and state variables (10), makes it ideally suited for
   global simulation studies under changing environmental conditions.},

Title = {Community metabolism and energy transfer in the Chesapeake Bay estuarine
   turbidity maximum},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {449},
Pages = {65-82},
Abstract = {In an effort to identify the key mechanisms controlling biological
   productivity and food web structure in the Chesapeake Bay estuarine
   turbidity maximum (ETM), we measured plankton community metabolism on a
   series of surveys in the upper Chesapeake Bay during the winter and
   spring of 2007 and 2008. Measured quantities included primary
   production, bacterial production, planktonic community respiration, and
   algal pigment concentrations. These measurements revealed a classic
   minimum in photosynthesis in the vicinity of the ETM. Temporal
   variability in plankton community metabolism, primary production,
   respiration, and bacterial production were highest in the southern
   oligohaline region down-estuary of the ETM and appeared to be driven by
   dynamic bio-physical interactions. Elevated primary production and
   community respiration in this region were often associated with the
   presence of mixotrophic dinoflagellates. The dinoflagellate contribution
   to primary production and respiration appeared to be particularly large
   as a result of their mixotrophic capabilities, which allow them to
   obtain energy both autotrophically and heterotrophically. The present
   study suggests that mixotrophic dinoflagellates play a key role in the
   pelagic food web in the oligohaline region of Chesapeake Bay, supplying
   most of the labile organic matter during late winter and spring and also
   providing a vector for transferring microbial production to
   mesozooplankton.},

Title = {Review of the diversity, traits, and ecology of zooxanthellate
   jellyfishes},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {166},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Many marine organisms form photosymbioses with zooxanthellae, but some,
   such as the medusozoans, are less well known. Here, we summarize the
   current knowledge on the diversity of zooxanthellate jellyfishes, to
   identify key traits of the holobionts, and to examine the impact of
   these traits on their ecology. Photosymbiosis with zooxanthellae
   originated at least seven times independently in Medusozoa; of these,
   five involve taxa with medusae. While most zooxanthellate jellyfishes
   are found in clades containing mainly non-zooxanthellate members, the
   sub-order Kolpophorae (Scyphozoa: Rhizostomeae) is comprised-bar a few
   intriguing exceptions-of only zooxanthellate jellyfishes. We estimate
   that 20-25\% of Scyphozoa species are zooxanthellate (facultative
   symbiotic species included). Zooxanthellae play a key role in scyphozoan
   life-cycle and nutrition although substantial variation is observed
   during ontogeny, or at the intra- and inter-specific levels.
   Nonetheless, three key traits of zooxanthellate jellyfishes can be
   identified: (1) zooxanthellate medusae, as holobionts, are generally
   mixotrophic, deriving their nutrition both from predation and
   photosynthesis; (2) zooxanthellate polyps, although capable of hosting
   zooxanthellae rarely depend on them; and (3) zooxanthellae play a key
   role in the life-cycle of the jellyfish by allowing or facilitating
   strobilation. We discuss how these traits might help to explain some
   aspects of the ecology of zooxanthellate jellyfishes-notably their
   generally low ability to outbreak, and their reaction to temperature
   stress or to eutrophication-and how they could in turn impact marine
   ecosystem functioning.},

Journal = {PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {In photosystem I (PSI) of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms the psaC
   polypeptide, encoded by the psaC gene, provides the ligands for two
   {[}4Fe-4S] clusters, F-A and F-B. Unlike other cyanobacteria, two
   different psaC genes have been reported in the cyanobacterium
   Synechocystis 6803, one (copy 1) with a deduced amino acid sequence
   identical to that of tobacco and another (copy 2) with a deduced amino
   acid sequence similar to those reported for other cyanobacteria.
   Insertion of a gene encoding kanamycin resistance into copy 2 resulted
   in a photosynthesis-deficient strain, CDK25, lacking the PsaC, PsaD and
   PsaE polypeptides in isolated thylakoid membranes, while the PsaA/PsaB
   and PsaF subunits were found. Growth of the mutant cells was
   indistinguishable from that of wild-type cells under light-activated
   heterotrophic growth (LAHG). A reversible P700(+) signal was detected by
   EPR spectroscopy in the isolated thylakoids during illumination at low
   temperature. Under these conditions, the EPR signals attributed to F-A
   and F-B were absent in the mutant strain, but a reversible F-x signal
   was present with broad resonances at g = 2.079, 1.903, and 1.784.
   Addition of PsaC and PsaD proteins to the thylakoids gave rise to
   resonances at g = 2.046, 1.936, 1.922, and 1.880; these values are
   characteristic of an interaction-type spectrum of F-A(-) and F-B(-). In
   room-temperature optical spectroscopic analysis, addition of PsaC and
   PsaD to the thylakoids also restored a 30 ms kinetic transient which is
   characteristic of the P700(+){[}F-A/F-B](-) backreaction. Expression of
   copy 1 was not detected in cells grown under LAHG and under mixotrophic
   conditions. These results demonstrate that copy 2 encodes the PsaC
   polypeptide in PSI in Synechocystis 6803, while copy 1 is not involved
   in PSI; that the PsaC polypeptide is necessary for stable assembly of
   PsaD and PsaE into PSI complex in vivo; and that PsaC, PsaD and PsaE are
   not needed for assembly of PsaA-PsaB dimer and electron transport from
   P700 to F-x.},

Title = {Reef building and carbonate production modes in the west-central Tethys
   during the Cenozoic},
Journal = {MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {83},
Pages = {261-304},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Changing components, rock textures, lithofacies, platform types and
   architecture throughout time are unique characteristics of carbonate
   rocks. Characterizing these attributes has been approached by 1)
   building reference models for specific Phanerozoic intervals, 2)
   recognizing the climatic impact in modulating carbonate production, and
   3) analyzing the influence of changing bio-geochemical conditions. The
   reference-model approach is mostly based on biological evolution, the
   climatic-impact approach emphasizes temperature, and the bio-geochemical
   approach considers the changes in Mg/Ca ratios and Ca++ concentrations
   in the oceans. To date, however, an analysis integrating all of these
   factors is still missing. The analysis presented here includes all these
   factors but also CO2, which is fundamental for both photosynthesis and
   CaCO3 precipitation.
   Here we analyze the waxing and waning of Cenozoic reef limestones from
   the central Tethys region through several steps: 1) on the basis of rock
   volume, rock textures, associated sediments and light dependent skeletal
   components, as records of light penetration and wave energy (depth); 2)
   on global environmental conditions (delta C-13, delta O-18, pCO(2),
   temperature); and 3) on the basis of functionality, nutritional
   requirements and available resources.
   Through the Cenozoic, water motion, whether induced by surface or
   internal waves or by currents, increased as the thermal gradients
   strengthened, both with depth and with latitude. Active water motion is
   essential for plankton catchers such as corals, but less so for many
   larger benthic foraminifers (LBF). Pycnoclines in the meso-oligophotic
   zone would then favor the benthic plankton catchers such as corals, but
   would be detrimental for many LBF. Warm temperatures favored LBF. The
   Eocene LBF families predominated during lowering of atmospheric pCO(2)
   by using respiratory CO2 to enhance the symbiont production of
   photosynthates under oligotrophic conditions and limited turbulence,
   whereas the Miocene families had to adapt to a progressive increase in
   turbulence. The eurythermal coralline red algae, however, became
   preponderant producers in the mesophotic zone during times when the
   delta C-13 was relatively high. This explains two apparent paradoxes: 1)
   corals thrive best when the Earth's high latitudes cool, and 2) the
   dominance of corals and LBF is inversely correlated, despite they both
   require tropical conditions and have similar trophic strategies
   (mixotrophy). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Rhythmic and sustained oscillations in metabolism and gene expression of
   <i>Cyanothece</i> sp ATCC 51142 under constant light},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {4},
Month = {DEC 6},
Abstract = {Cyanobacteria, a group of photosynthetic prokaryotes, oscillate between
   day and nighttime metabolisms with concomitant oscillations in gene
   expression in response to light/dark cycles (LD).The oscillations in
   gene expression have been shown to sustain in constant light (LL) with a
   free running period of 24 h in a model cyanobacterium Synechococcus
   elongatus PCC 7942. However, equivalent oscillations in metabolism are
   not reported under LL in this non-nitrogen fixing cyanobacterium. Here
   we focus on Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142, a unicellular, nitrogen-fixing
   cyanobacterium known to temporally separate the processes of oxygenic
   photosynthesis and oxygen-sensitive nitrogen fixation. In a recent
   report, metabolism of Cyanothece 51142 has been shown to oscillate
   between photosynthetic and respiratory phases under LL with free running
   periods that are temperature dependent but significantly shorter than
   the circadian period. Further, the oscillations shift to circadian
   pattern at moderate cell densities that are concomitant with slower
   growth rates. Here we take this understanding forward and demonstrate
   that the ultradian rhythm under LL sustains at much higher cell
   densities when grown under turbulent regimes that simulate flashing
   light effect. Our results suggest that the ultradian rhythm in
   metabolism may be needed to support higher carbon and nitrogen
   requirements of rapidly growing cells under LL. With a comprehensive
   Real time PCR based gene expression analysis we account for key
   regulatory interactions and demonstrate the interplay between clock
   genes and the genes of key metabolic pathways. Further, we observe that
   several genes that peak at dusk in Synechococcus peak at dawn in
   Cyanothece and vice versa. The circadian rhythm of this organism appears
   to be more robust with peaking of genes in anticipation of the ensuing
   photosynthetic and respiratory metabolic phases.},

Title = {Mixotrophic ciliates in an Andean lake:: dependence on light and prey of
   an <i>Ophrydium naumanni</i> population},
Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {47},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {1. Planktonic ciliates were examined during a spring-summer period
   (November 1998-April 1999) in the ultraoligotrophic Lake Moreno Oeste
   (41degrees5'S and 71degrees33'W, 758 m a.s.l), which belongs to the
   Nahuel Huapi System (Patagonia, Argentina). The lake is deep (Z(max) =
   90 m) and warm monomictic.
   2. Sampling was performed at a mid-lake station, where vertical profiles
   of temperature and light were measured in situ, and samples for bacteria
   and ciliates enumeration were taken throughout the water column.
   3. The peritrich Ophrydium naumanni, a freshwater pelagic ciliate with
   endosymbiotic Chlorella, was the dominant ciliate in the lake.
   4. Ophrydium naumanni and autotrophic picoplankton exhibit a clear
   coincidence in their vertical distribution (P < 0.05), preferring levels
   at or near the 1\% of surface photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)
   irradiance. Both may have the same light requirements, or the
   coincidence may reflect a trophic relationship.
   5. Dependence on light and prey by O. naumanni were studied using field
   experiments, in which we analysed ciliate grazing on bacteria, and in
   laboratory experiments, in which we compared particle uptake under dark
   and light conditions.
   6. Ophrydium naumanni was able to ingest particles {[}latex microspheres
   and fluorescently labelled bacteria (FLB)] in field and laboratory
   experiment, indicating that it has the potential to affect bacteria
   population of Lake Moreno Oeste.
   7. Ciliate particle ingestion was observed to be dependent on light
   availability because under dark conditions, the ingestion was lowered (P
   < 0.05).},

Title = {Phenotypic characterization of <i>Synechocystis</i> sp PCC 6803
   substrains reveals differences in sensitivity to abiotic stress},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 7},
Abstract = {Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is a widely used model cyanobacterium, whose
   substrains can vary on both genotype and phenotype levels. Previously
   described phenotypic variations include ability of mixotrophic growth,
   ability of movement on agar plates and variations in pigments
   composition or cell size. In this study, we report for the first time
   significant variation among Synechocystis substrains in complex cellular
   traits such as growth rate, photosynthesis efficiency, cellular dry
   weight and cellular composition (including protein or carbohydrates
   content). We also confirmed previously reported differences in cell
   size. Synechocystis cultures were cultivated in controlled environment
   of flat panel photobioreactors under red, blue and white light of
   intensities up to 790 mu mol(photons) m(-2) s(-1), temperatures 23
   degrees C-60 degrees C, input CO2 concentrations ranging from 400 to 15
   000 ppm and in BG11 cultivation medium with and without addition of
   NaCl. Three Synechocystis substrains were used for the comparative
   experiments: GT-L, GT-B (Brno, CZ) and PCC-B (Brno, CZ). Growth rates of
   Synechocystis GT-B were inhibited under high intensities of red light
   (585-670 nm), and growth rates of both substrains GT-B and PCC-B were
   inhibited under photons of wavelengths 485-585 nm and 670-700 nm.
   Synechocystis GT-B was more sensitive to low temperatures than the other
   two tested substrains, and Synechocystis GT-L was sensitive to the
   presence of NaCl in the cultivation media. The results suggest that
   stress sensitivity of commonly used Synechocystis substrains can
   strongly vary, similarly as glucose tolerance or motility as reported
   previously. Our study further supports the previous statement that
   emphasizes importance of proper Synechocystis substrains selection and
   awareness of phenotypical differences among Synechocystis substrains
   which is crucial for comparative and reproducible research. This is
   highly relevant for studies related to stress physiology and development
   of sustainable biotechnological applications.},

Pages = {179-191},
Abstract = {Chrysophyte algae show wide variation in their nutritional modes, which
   can be especially advantageous in oligotrophic conditions. However, the
   capacities and strategies of the algae to adapt to changing conditions
   may vary due to different nutritional requirements of individual
   species. In this context, comparative analyses evaluating the
   physiological range of mixotrophic chrysophytes are important to predict
   possible changes in phytoplankton composition. We compared 4 freshwater
   chrysophytes-Poteriospumella lacustris, Poterioochromonas malhamensis,
   Dinobryon divergens and Mallomonas annulata-under different growth
   conditions. The diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum served as a
   photoautotrophic reference strain. We demonstrate active growth of P.
   lacustris and the mixotrophic P. malhamensis under chemoheterotrophic
   conditions. Neither of the chrysophytes were growing
   photoautotrophically; however, P. malhamensis showed some photosynthetic
   activity and survived longer when kept in the light. M. annulata, P.
   tricornutum and the mixotrophic D. divergens showed light-limited growth
   when kept in inorganic media. Even though D. divergens consumed living
   bacteria, it did not grow in the dark in the presence of the bacteria
   only. We detected large differences in the general nutritional
   preferences between the 2 mixotrophs in relation to the nutritional
   features of all investigated strains.},

Abstract = {Key Message Minimum temperature and compensated temperature resulted in
   significant impact on in vitro establishment. Blue + red combined with
   natural ventilation resulted in efficient shoot proliferation.
   Paclobutrazol increased the pigment content.
   Photomixotrophic micropropagation systems have been associated with
   improved development of several plant species. In this work, we
   established an efficient protocol for the in vitro micropropagation of
   Bambusa oldhamii Munro by studying the influence of the rainy and dry
   seasons on plant tissue contamination, the effects of the gaseous
   atmosphere inside the culture flasks, and the effects of radiation
   conditions on plant morphogenetic events. Explants were collected from
   March to December 2016. The conditions consisted of 100\% blue (455 nm),
   100\% red (630 nm), 30\% blue + 70\% red, and 30\% red + 70\% blue LED
   light or fluorescent light only (as a control). For induction of
   axillary sprouting, the explants were inoculated in MS media + 2.27 mu M
   thidiazuron or 3.40 mu M paclobutrazol. The best growth responses were
   observed for material collected from June to July. There was an increase
   of 81.79\% in the number of leaves under the 30\% blue + 70\% red LED
   treatment in comparison to the control. The facilitation of gas exchange
   resulted in improved shoot production, with an increase of 70.80\% under
   30\% red + 70\% blue LED light in comparison to that of treatments
   without gas exchange. The blue LED light had an important
   photomorphogenic effect on the development of bamboo explants into
   shoots, as shoot proliferation increased. The results obtained will aid
   in the development of protocols for the in vitro culture of other
   species of bamboo as well as for the establishment of an efficient
   protocol to address rooting for this and other bamboo species.},

Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms in the Chesapeake Bay and coastal bays of Maryland,
   USA, are not a new phenomenon, but may be increasing in frequency and
   diversity. Outbreaks of Pfiesteria piscicida (Dinophyceae) were observed
   during 1997 in several Chesapeake Bay tributaries, while in 1998,
   Pfiesteria-related events were not found but massive blooms of
   Prorocentrum minimum (Dinophyceae) occurred. In 1999, Aureococcus
   anophagefferens (Pelagophyceae) developed in the coastal bays in early
   summer in sufficient densities to cause a brown tide. In 1997, toxic
   Pfiesteria was responsible for fish kills at relatively low cell
   densities. In 1998 and 1999, the blooms of P. minimum and A.
   anophagefferens were not toxic, but reached sufficiently high densities
   to have ecological consequences. These years differed in the amount and
   timing of rainfall events and resulting nutrient loading from the
   largely agricultural watershed. Nutrient loading to the eastern
   tributaries of Chesapeake Bay has been increasing over the past decade.
   Much of this nutrient delivery is in organic form. The sites of the
   Pfiesteria outbreaks ranked among those with the highest organic loading
   of all sites monitored bay-wide. The availability of dissolved organic
   carbon and phosphorus were also higher at sites experiencing A.
   anophagefferens blooms than at those without blooms. The ability to
   supplement photosynthesis with grazing or organic substrates and to use
   a diversity of organic nutrients may play a role in the development and
   maintenance of these species. For P minimum and A. anophagefferens, urea
   is used preferentially over nitrate. Pfiesteria is a grazer, but also
   has the ability to take up nutrients directly. The timing of nutrient
   delivery may also be of critical importance in determining the success
   of certain species.},

Title = {Effects of environmental variables on midsummer dinoflagellate community
   in the Neva Estuary (Baltic Sea)},
Journal = {OCEANOLOGIA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {61},
Number = {2},
Pages = {197-207},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Dinoflagellates account for most of the harmful phytoplankton species
   but relatively little is known about the specific responses of different
   species to environmental variables. 21 dinoflagellate species were
   recorded in the plankton of the Neva Estuary since the mid-19th century.
   14-year long data of midsummer dinoflagellate biomass was statistically
   analyzed in the Neva Estuary to show the changes in dinoflagellate
   species in relation to environmental factors. Biomasses of Dinophysis
   norvegica (Clapared \& Lachmann 1859), Prorocentrum lima ((Ehrenberg)
   F.Stein 1878) and Peridinium aciculiferum (Lemmermann 1900) had very
   similar positive relationships with salinity, temperature, phosphorus
   and suspended particulate organic matter concentrations while the
   biomass of the other common species Peridinium cinctum ((Muller)
   Ehrenberg 1832) and Peridinium sp. mostly showed quite opposite trends.
   Climate fluctuations leading to changes in the environmental variables
   could significantly affect the composition and productivity of the
   dinoflagellate community. Biomass of Glenodinium sp. and Peridinium sp.
   positively correlated with primary production and biomass and
   chlorophyll a concentration, but did not show a positive relationship
   with phosphorus. This may be due to the fact that these species in the
   conditions of the Neva Estuary, apparently, are more consumers than
   producers of organic matter, feeding on algae and cyanobacteria of
   phytoplankton. Therefore, to interpret the relationships between the
   dinoflagellate biomass and environmental variables one should take into
   account that the species of this group is characterized by mixotrophy
   and, consequently, their biomass may depend not only on the conditions
   of autotrophic, but also heterotrophic nutrition. (C) 2018 Institute of

Title = {Multiscale modelling of mixotrophic algal growth in pilot-scale
   photobioreactors and its application to microalgal cultivation using
   wastewater},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {214},
Number = {3},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This multiscale model quantifies transport and reaction processes in
   mixotrophic microalgal growth at three characteristic length scales,
   namely, macro (photobioreactor), meso (algal cell), micro (organelles).
   The macro and the meso scale equations capture the temporal dynamics of
   the transport of CO2, O-2, H+, organic carbon and nitrogen sources in
   the photobioreactor and the cell, respectively, while the micro scale
   quantifies the reaction rates of CO2 fixation and photorespiration in
   the chloroplast, and mitochondrial respiration. Our model is validated
   using our experiments (R-2 = 0.96-0.99) on urea, CO2 (0.04-5\%), and
   acetic acid-mediated mixotrophic cultivation of Chlorella sorokiniana
   for 138 h using municipal wastewater (with and without media) at 11,000
   lx light in 25-liter pilot-scale bubble-column photobioreactors, which
   produces 0.47-2.74 g/L biomass with 22.8-29.6\% lipids, while reducing
   the COD, ammonium, phosphate, nickel, and H+ concentrations by 65-89\%.
   The alga assimilates the ammonium and the phosphates present in
   wastewater into amino acids and ATP, respectively. Our simulations
   quantify the autotrophic and heterotrophic components of mixotrophic
   biomass yield to find the optimal inlet CO2 concentration (of 3\%) that
   synergizes autotrophic CO2 sequestration with heterotrophic assimilation
   of organic carbon, thereby maximizing both autotrophic and heterotrophic
   growths. Super-optimal levels of inlet CO2 acidify the stroma of the
   chloroplast, inhibit RuBisCo's enzymatic activity for CO2 fixation in
   the Calvin Cycle, decelerate carrier-mediated uptake of acetate, and
   reduce biomass yields. Our harvesting process drastically reduces the
   algal harvesting time to less than 29 min. This multiscale
   reaction-transport model provides a useful tool for further scaling up
   this pilot-scale technology that synergistically integrates CO2
   sequestration and wastewater treatment with rapid microalgal cultivation
   (using municipal wastewater without autoclaving) and cost-effective
   harvesting.},

Title = {The skeleton of<i> Balanophyllia</i> coral species suggests adaptive
   traits linked to the onset of mixotrophy},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {795},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {The diversity in the skeletal features of coral species is an outcome of
   their evolution, distribution and habitat. Here, we explored, from
   macro-to nano-scale, the skeletal structural and compositional
   characteristics of three coral species belonging to the genus
   Balanophyllia having different trophic strategies. The goal is to
   address whether the onset of mixotrophy influenced the skeletal features
   of B. elegans, B. regia, and B. europaea. The macroscale data suggest
   that the presence of symbiotic algae in B. europaea can lead to a
   surplus of energy input that increases its growth rate and skeletal bulk
   density, leading to larger and denser corals compared to the
   azooxanthellate ones, B. regia and B. elegans. The symbiosis would also
   explain the higher intra-skeletal organic matrix (OM) content, which is
   constituted by macromolecules promoting the calcification, in B.
   europaea compared to the azooxanthellate species. The characterization
   of the soluble OM also revealed differences between B. europaea and the
   azooxanthellate species, which may be linked to diverse macromolecular
   machineries responsible for skeletal biosynthesis and final morphology.
   Differently, the crystallographic features were homogenous among
   species, suggesting that the basic building blocks of skeletons remained
   a conserved trait in these related species, regardless of the trophic
   strategy. These results show changes in skeletal phenotype that could be
   triggered by the onset of mixotrophy, as a consequence of the symbiotic
   association, displaying remarkable plasticity of coral skeletons which
   repeatedly allowed this coral group to adapt to a range of changing
   environments throughout its geological history. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Engineered production of isoprene from the model green microalga
   Chlamydomonas reinhardtii},
Journal = {METABOLIC ENGINEERING COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Isoprene is a clear, colorless, volatile 5-carbon hydrocarbon that is
   one monomer of all cellular isoprenoids and a platform chemical with
   multiple applications in industry. Many plants have evolved isoprene
   synthases (IspSs) with the capacity to liberate isoprene from
   dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP) as part of cellular thermotolerance
   mechanisms. Isoprene is hydrophobic and volatile, rapidly leaves plant
   tissues and is one of the main carbon emission sources from vegetation
   globally. The universality of isoprenoid metabolism allows volatile
   isoprene production from microbes expressing heterologous IspSs. Here,
   we compared heterologous overexpression from the nuclear genome and
   localization into the plastid of four plant terpene synthases (TPs) in
   the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Using sealed vial
   mixotrophic cultivation, direct quantification of isoprene production
   was achieved from the headspace of living cultures, with the highest
   isoprene production observed in algae expressing the Ipomoea batatas
   IspS. Perturbations of the downstream carotenoid pathway through keto
   carotenoid biosynthesis enhanced isoprene titers, which could be further
   enhanced by increasing flux towards DMADP through heterologous
   co-expression of a yeast isopentenyl-DP delta isomerase. Multiplexed
   controlled-environment testing revealed that cultivation temperature,
   rather than illumination intensity, was the main factor affecting
   isoprene yield from the engineered alga. This is the first report of
   heterologous isoprene production from a eukaryotic alga and sets a
   foundation for further exploration of carbon conversion to this
   commodity chemical.},

Abstract = {Premise of the study : The goal of this study was to illuminate the
   evolutionary history and ecological importance of plant mixotrophy-the
   uptake and utilization of exogenous organic compounds.
   Methods : We quantitatively assessed the effect of sugar amendments on
   laboratory growth of Sphagnum compactum as a representative emergent
   peat moss and two species of ecologically associated zygnematalean
   algae, Cylindrocystis brebissonii and Mougeotia sp.
   Key results : Together with observations published elsewhere, our
   results suggest that under carbon or light limitation, the uptake of
   exogenous sugars by cells of charophycean algae and peat mosses may help
   these organisms maintain positive carbon balance. Utilization of 1\%
   glucose by aquatic-grown algae helped to relieve dissolved inorganic
   carbon limitation, enhancing photoautotrophic growth by factors of 9.0
   and 1.7, respectively. After an 8-wk growth period, amendments of 1\%
   and 2\% glucose enhanced air-grown moss biomass by 28 and 39 times,
   respectively, that of controls lacking sugar amendments. After 9 wk, 1\%
   fructose enhanced biomass by 21 times, and 2\% sucrose enhanced biomass
   by 31 times.
   Conclusion : Our results indicate that plant mixotrophy is an
   early-evolved trait. The results also indicate that quantitative
   differences in sugar utilization by bryophytes and charophycean algae
   correlate with relative investments in protective cell-wall
   polyphenolics measured in previous studies, suggesting that sugar
   utilization may subsidize the cost of producing phenolic wall compounds
   in bryophytes.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 8},
Abstract = {With the growing human population, greenhouse gases and global
   temperature are increasing calling for sustainable biorefineries to
   convert low-value side streams into high-value products. In this study,
   the remaining hemicellulosic sugary waste fraction of a wheat straw
   biorefinery approach, without any pretreatment, was applied as a medium
   supplement for Chlorella vulgaris cultivation. Next to oligomeric and
   monomeric sugars, the waste stream contained hydrolysis by-products,
   such as furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and acetic acid. Despite the
   presence of these growth inhibitors, C. vulgaris cultivation was
   possible. Addition of 2.5\% (v/v) of wheat straw hydrolysate to
   BG11-medium boosted chlorophyll content in C. vulgaris by 40\% compared
   to photoautotrophically grown cells solely cultivated on defined media.
   As of now, this is the highest chlorophyll content obtained from a
   cultivation of C. vulgaris on a medium supplemented with a waste stream.
   Overall, our results demonstrate that wheat straw hydrolysate increases
   chlorophyll biosynthesis, improving the nutritional value of C. vulgaris
   biomass for food and feed applications. Hence, valorization of this
   hemicellulosic sugary fraction results in an additional high-valued
   product contributing towards the wheat straw biorefinery.},

Abstract = {Clones of Cryptomonas phaseolus Skuja, Cryptomonas rostratiformis
   (Skuja) Skuja in Huber-Pestalozzi, and Cryptomonas undulata Gervais were
   isolated from the deep chlorophyll maximum near the oxic/anoxic boundary
   layer of the mesoeutrophic lake Schlachtensee, Germany. Different
   autecological features of these species were studied in batch culture
   experiments. Cryptomonas cf. ovata Ehrenberg and Chroomonas sp. that
   never dominated in the deep chlorophyll layer were also isolated from
   Schlachtensee to study their light-dependent growth in comparison to the
   deep-living species. Cryptomonas undulata, C. cf. ovata, and C.
   phaseolus had a very low light compensation point (5-7 mu mol . m(-2).
   s(-1)), whereas the growth rate of Chroomonas sp. and C. rostratiformis
   was positive above 16 and 24 mu mol . m(-2). s(-1). Cryptomonas
   phaseolus and Chroomonas sp. became photoinhibited above photon flux
   densities of 92 and 116 mu mol . m(-2). s(-1). Cryptomonas
   rostratiformis, C. cf. ovata, and C. undulata reached a maximum growth
   rate at a considerably higher photon flux density (198-250 mu mol .
   m(-2). s(-1)). Cryptomonas phaseolus grew fastest under light-limiting
   conditions. Cryptomonas phaseolus and C. undulata were best able to
   survive prolonged periods of darkness. Cryptomonas phaseolus, C.
   rostratiformis, and C. undulata did not show any uptake of fluorescent
   latex beads. When labeled glucose was provided in naturally occurring
   concentrations, carbon uptake by C. phaseolus, C. rostratiformis, and C.
   undulata was negligibly small in comparison to cellular carbon content.
   I suggest that the adaptation to a low-light environment is an important
   preadaptation for the dominance of C. phaseolus and C. undulata near the
   freshwater chemocline.},

Abstract = {Synechocystis 6803 is a strain of unicellular freshwater cyanobacteria
   that can grow in both phototrophic and mixotrophic conditions. We
   investigated the effects of exogenous ( +)-usnic acid (0.01, 0.1, and 1
   mu M) on the growth, photosynthetic pigments, and metabolic profiles of
   Synechocystis 6803 culture through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
   analysis (GC-MS) coupled with multivariate statistical analysis.
   Treatment with 1 mu M ( +)-usnic acid enhanced the cell growth at day 14
   and the photosynthetic pigments and relative levels (intensity g(-1)) of
   various bioactive metabolites such as glycine, serine, palmitoleic acid,
   alpha-linolenic acid, linoleic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid,
   1-monopalmitin, glycerol monostearate, neophytadiene, and
   alpha-tocopherol at days 8 and 14. Moreover, enhanced productivity of
   alpha-tocopherol was achieved on days 8 (0.36 +/- 0.03 mg L-1 or 348 +/-
   28 mu g g(-1)) and 14 (0.47 +/- 0.05 mg L-1 or 457 +/- 52 mu g g(-1))

Abstract = {Most algae regularly experience periods of darkness ranging from a few
   hours to a few days. During this time, they are unable to
   photosynthesize, and so must consume stored energy products. However,
   some organisms such as polar algae and some microalgal cysts and spores
   are exposed to darkness for months to years, and these must use
   alternative strategies to survive. Some taxa, such as dinoflagellates,
   form cysts and become dormant. Others use physiological methods or adopt
   mixotrophy. The longest documented survival of more than a century was
   for dinoflagellates buried in sediments in a Norwegian fjord. Seasonal
   changes in daylight hours are naturally unaffected by climate change.
   This means that polar microalgae will in the future need to survive the
   same period of seasonal darkness but at higher temperatures, and this
   will require a greater drawdown of stored energy. Recent experimental
   work has shown that both Arctic and Antarctic phytoplankton are able to
   survive increases of up to 6 degrees C in the dark.},

Title = {Synergistic dynamics of critical cofactors effectuates fuel relevant
   metabolic profile of <i>Scenedesmus</i> sp.: Targeting cleaner energy
   production},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {297},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Microalgae based biofuel is dictated to a great extent by certain
   synergistic interactions between critical nutrients as well as the
   quality and quantity of light energy available. For latitude regions
   with high light irradiance for a greater part of year, it is important
   to optimize the proportions of critical nutrients for microalgae species
   to display a suitable metabolic profile and not loose advantage when
   total light energy input increases. In this study, the conjunct impact
   of light intensity using white LED, together with photoperiod and
   nutrients (nitrate, phosphate and glucose) depleted and replete
   conditions on energy storage metabolites and fuel characteristics of
   Scenedesmus sp. were investigated under a mixotrophic growth regime.
   Results show that Scenedesmus sp. could efficiently exploit even very
   intense light, for longer duration (216 mmolm(-2)s(-1) at 16:8 light:
   dark photoperiod) in presence of 1.5 g/L of sodium nitrate, 0.04 g/L of
   di-sodium hydrogen phosphate and 5 g/L of glucose (G(5)N(1.5)P(0.04)) to
   produce a biomass of 1782.4 +/- 56.8 mg/mL with a specific growth rate
   of 0.2 +/- 0.007 day(-1). High light intensity (216 mmolm(-2)s(-1)) and
   organic carbon at 16:8 light: dark photoperiod (L-16:D-8) led to
   increased synthesis of carbohydrate content in the absence of nitrate
   and phosphate (1924.8 +/- 128.6 mg/mg at G(5)N(0)P(0)), increased TFA in
   the absence of nitrate (59.5 mg/mg at G(5)N(0)P(0.04)) and high lipid
   content (154.1 +/- 7.7 mg/mg at G(5)N(1.5)P(0.04)) without obliterating
   growth. Certain vital properties that determine the biodiesel quality
   were computed and compared to the parallel parameters put forth by
   European and American biodiesel norms. These results stand to be a
   baseline for sustainable algal bio-refinery and create futuristic vistas
   for further evaluation of Scenedesmus sp. for bio-energy applications in
   countries like India having tropical climate with high solar incoming
   radiation for a greater part of the year. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Red mud is a by-product of the production of alumina from bauxite ore.
   However, less than 2\% of red mud produced is currently utilized. Red
   mud contains a number of residual scarce metals including rare earth
   elements, some at a considerable concentration, so synchronous cultures
   of the red microalga Galdieria sulphuraria were tested for their ability
   to grow in red mud-containing medium and accumulate these rare earth
   elements from the mud. Red mud was added to the growth medium as an acid
   extract (in 10\% v/v HNO3). Pigment content and photosynthetic
   performance are indicators of physiological condition and stress levels
   in microalgae. Growth of the treated culture was suppressed compared to
   an untreated control and the content of chlorophyll a and phycocyanin
   decreased while carotenoids increased substantially. Photosynthetic
   performance, determined as Fv/Fm, was almost unaffected by the red mud
   treatment. The concentration of individual rare earth elements in the
   red mud extract and the biomass, was determined using ICP-MS. The most
   accumulated rare earth elements were Ce, Nd, La, and Y (26, 15, 11 and
   11 mu g g(-1) DM, respectively). G. sulphuraria was also cultivated
   under different trophic regimes, auto- and mixotrophically, with the
   addition of red mud extract. Growth of all cultures were comparable. The
   concentration of total accumulated rare earth elements was surprisingly
   high in mixotrophic G. sulphuraria (109 mu g g(-1) DM) but was tenfold
   lower in the autotrophic culture.},

   three pCO(2) levels (230, 433, and 765 ppm) in a short-term experiment
   (2 weeks). The four dominant species were then isolated from each
   treatment into clonal cultures, and maintained at all three pCO(2)
   levels for approximately 1 year. Periodically (4, 8, and 12 months),
   these pCO(2)-conditioned clones were recombined into artificial
   communities, and allowed to compete at their conditioning pCO(2) level
   or at higher and lower levels. The dominant species in these artificial
   communities of CO2-conditioned clones differed from those in the
   original short-term experiment, but individual species relative
   abundance trends across pCO(2) treatments were often similar. Specific
   growth rates showed no strong evidence for fitness increases
   attributable to conditioning pCO(2) level. Although pCO(2) significantly
   structured our experimental communities, conditioning time and biotic
   interactions like mixotrophy also had major roles in determining
   competitive outcomes. New methods of carrying out extended mixed species
   experiments are needed to accurately predict future long-term
   phytoplankton community responses to changing pCO(2).},

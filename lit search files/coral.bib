Abstract = {The productivity of coral reefs in oligotrophic tropical waters is
   sustained by an efficient uptake and recycling of nutrients. In
   reef-building corals, the engineers of these ecosystems, this nutrient
   recycling is facilitated by a constant exchange of nutrients between the
   animal host and endosymbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellates
   (zooxanthellae), bacteria, and other microbes. Due to the complex
   interactions in this so-called coral holobiont, it has proven difficult
   to understand the environmental limitations of productivity in corals.
   Among others, the micronutrient iron has been proposed to limit primary
   productivity due to its essential role in photosynthesis and bacterial
   processes. Here, we tested the effect of iron enrichment on the
   physiology of the coral Pocillopora verrucosa from the central Red Sea
   during a 12-day experiment. Contrary to previous reports, we did not see
   an increase in zooxanthellae population density or gross photosynthesis.
   Conversely, respiration rates were significantly increased, and
   microbial nitrogen fixation was significantly decreased. Taken together,
   our data suggest that iron is not a limiting factor of primary
   productivity in Red Sea corals. Rather, increased metabolic demands in
   response to iron enrichment, as evidenced by increased respiration
   rates, may reduce carbon (i.e., energy) availability in the coral
   holobiont, resulting in reduced microbial nitrogen fixation. This
   decrease in nitrogen supply in turn may exacerbate the limitation of
   other nutrients, creating a negative feedback loop. Thereby, our results
   highlight that the effects of iron enrichment appear to be strongly
   dependent on local environmental conditions and ultimately may depend on
   the availability of other nutrients.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the effect of a long term (3 wk) change in
   salinity (increase or decrease of 2 to 4 psu) on the rates of
   photosynthesis and respiration of the zooxanthellate coral Stylophora
   pistillata. Colonies were exposed to 4 levels of salinity (34, 36, 38
   and 40 psu, with 38 psu as the control salinity) and results were
   compared using I-factor ANOVAs. Salinity had a significant effect on the
   protein concentration. It was 30\% higher at 38 psu than at the other
   salinities. It had also a significant effect on the rates of
   photosynthesis, respiration and on the P-g:R ratio. Gross maximal
   photosynthetic rates were 50\% lower at 34, 36 and 40 psu than at 38
   psu. The P-g:R ratio was always higher at the control salinity. Most of
   the colonies maintained at 40 psu died, and this was explained by a very
   low P-g:R ratio (<1). S. pistillata is therefore especially sensitive to
   small changes in salinity and seems to acclimate more easily to hypo-
   rather than to hypersaline conditions.},

Title = {The response of the scleractinian coral <i>Turbinaria reniformis</i> to

Abstract = {The physiological response of the scleractinian coral Turbinaria
   reniformis to ammonium enrichment (3 mu mol l(-1)) was examined at 26
   degrees C as well as during a 7 day increase in temperature to 31
   degrees C (thermal stress). At 26 degrees C, ammonium supplementation
   had little effect on the coral physiology. It induced a decrease in
   symbiont density, compensated by an increase in chlorophyll content per
   symbiont cell. Organic carbon release was reduced, likely because of a
   better utilization of the photosynthesized carbon (i.e. incorporation
   into proteins, kept in the coral tissue). The delta N-15 signatures of
   the ammonium-enriched symbionts and host tissue were also significantly
   decreased, by 4 and 2 parts per thousand, respectively, compared with
   the non-enriched conditions, suggesting a significant uptake of
   inorganic nitrogen by the holobiont. Under thermal stress, coral
   colonies that were not nitrogen enriched experienced a drastic decrease
   in photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments (chlorophyll a,
   beta-carotene, diadinoxanthin, diatoxanthin and peridinin), followed by
   a decrease in the rates of photosynthesis and calcification. Organic
   carbon release was not affected by this thermal stress. Conversely,
   nitrogen-enriched corals showed an increase in their pigment
   concentrations, and maintained rates of photosynthesis and calcification
   at ca. 60\% and 100\% of those measured under control conditions,
   respectively. However, these corals lost more organic carbon into the
   environment. Overall, these results indicate that inorganic nitrogen
   availability can be important to determining the resilience of some
   scleractinian coral species to thermal stress, and can have a function
   equivalent to that of heterotrophic feeding concerning the maintenance
   of coral metabolism under stress conditions.},

Abstract = {Plesiastrea versipora is a hermatypic coral with a distribution that
   extends to the southern limit for hermatypic corals. The normal annual
   temperature range for this coral in Port Phillip Bay (Victoria)
   (approximately 10-21 degreesC) is well below the physiological optimum
   for the majority of hermatypic corals (25-29 degreesC). The rate of
   photosynthesis and respiration in Plesiastrea generally increased with
   temperature before levelling out at the higher temperatures, with Q(10)
   data suggesting that both photosynthesis and respiration in Plesiastrea
   acclimate to changing temperatures. Respiration showed a similar trend
   to photosynthesis, with respect to temperature, but with a slightly
   lower rate of increase. Photosynthetic rate in Plesiastrea is comparable
   with that of reef corals despite lower temperatures and irradiance. When
   expressed as a function of chlorophyll a content photosynthesis
   approached perfect temperature compensation with prolonged exposure to
   various temperatures. Temperature-dependent changes with chlorophyll
   content may be responsible for temperature related changes in
   photosynthetic rate. This may be a mechanism for stabilising the
   symbiotic relationship over a wide temperature range. Autotrophic
   ability, estimated from photosynthesis/respiration (P/R) ratios, was
   greatest at higher temperatures and was only slightly less than that of
   reef corals. At low temperatures Plesiastrea may be dependent on
   heterotrophic feeding. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   Coral Holobiont},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {The nutritional symbiosis between coral hosts and photosynthetic
   dinoflagellates is fundamental to the functioning of coral reefs. Rising
   seawater temperatures destabilize this relationship, resulting in
   drastic declines in world-wide coral cover. Thermal history is thought
   to play an important role in shaping a coral's response to subsequent
   thermal stress. Here, we exposed Pocillopora damicomis to two thermal
   acclimation regimes (ambient vs. warm) and compared the effect that
   acclimation had on the coral holobiont's response to a subsequent seven
   day heat stress event. We conducted daily physiological measurements at
   the holobiont level (gross photosynthesis, respiration, host protein
   content, symbiont density and chlorophyll content) throughout the
   heating event, as well as cellular-level imaging of C-13-bicarbonate and
   N-15-nitrate assimilation (using NanoSIMS) at the end of the heat stress
   event. Thermal acclimation history had a negligible effect on the
   measurements conducted at the holobiont level during the heat stress
   event. No differences were observed in the O-2-budget between ambient
   and warm-acclimated corals and only small fluctuations in host protein,
   symbiont density and chlorophyll content were detected. In contrast,
   this lack of differential response, was not mirrored at the cellular
   level. Warm-acclimated corals had substantially higher C-13 enrichment
   in the host gastrodermis and lipid bodies, but significantly lower
   N-15-nitrate assimilation in the symbionts and the host tissue layers,
   relative to the ambient-acclimated corals. We discuss potential reasons
   for the disconnect that occurred between symbiont bicarbonate and
   nitrate assimilation (in the absence of photosynthetic breakdown) in the
   warm-acclimated corals. We suggest this represents either a shift in
   nitrogen utilization, or supply limitation by the host. Our findings
   raise several interesting hypotheses regarding the role that nitrogen
   metabolism plays in thermal stress, which will warrant further
   investigation if we are to understand the acclimatization capacity of
   the coral holobiont.},

   gas-volumeter (Productmeter). Net photosynthetic rate under all
   irradiances was higher in winter than in summer at the lower range of
   temperature (12-20degreesC), while lower than in summer at the higher
   range of temperature (20-30degreesC). The optimum temperature for net
   photosynthesis was apt to fall with the decrease of irradiance both in
   summer and winter, whereas it was higher in summer than in winter under
   each irradiance. At 25/50/100 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1), it was nearly
   the seawater temperature in each season. Dark respiration rate was
   higher in winter than in summer, especially in the range from
   20-30degreesC. In both seasons the optimum temperature for gross
   photosynthesis was 28degreesC under 400 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1) and
   lowered with decreasing irradiance up to 22degreesC under 25 mumol
   photons m(-2) s(-1) in summer, while 20degreesC under the same
   irradiance in winter. The optimum temperature for production/respiration
   (P/R) ratio was higher in summer than in winter under each irradiance.
   Results indicated that metabolism of coral and zooxanthellae is adapted
   to ambient temperature condition under nearly natural irradiance in each

Abstract = {Enhancing the resilience of corals to rising temperatures is now a
   matter of urgency, leading to growing efforts to explore the use of heat
   tolerant symbiont species to improve their thermal resilience. The
   notion that adaptive traits can be retained by transferring the
   symbionts alone, however, challenges the holobiont concept, a
   fundamental paradigm in coral research. Holobiont traits are products of
   a specific community (holobiont) and all its co-evolutionary and local
   adaptations, which might limit the retention or transference of
   holobiont traits by exchanging only one partner. Here we evaluate how
   interchanging partners affect the short- and long-term performance of
   holobionts under heat stress using clonal lineages of the cnidarian
   model system Aiptasia (host and Symbiodiniaceae strains) originating
   from distinct thermal environments. Our results show that holobionts
   from more thermally variable environments have higher plasticity to heat
   stress, but this resilience could not be transferred to other host
   genotypes through the exchange of symbionts. Importantly, our findings
   highlight the role of the host in determining holobiont productivity in
   response to thermal stress and indicate that local adaptations of
   holobionts will likely limit the efficacy of interchanging unfamiliar
   compartments to enhance thermal tolerance.},

Abstract = {Disentangling the metabolic functioning of corals' endosymbionts
   (Symbiodiniaceae) is relevant to understanding the response of coral
   reefs to warming oceans. In this work, we first question whether there
   is an energetic coupling between photosynthesis and respiration in
   Symbiodiniaceae (Symbiodinium,DurusdiniumandEffrenium), and second, how
   different levels of energetic coupling will affect their adaptive
   responses to global warming. Coupling between photosynthesis and
   respiration was established by determining the variation of metabolic
   rates during thermal response curves, and how inhibition of respiration
   affects photosynthesis. Adaptive (irreversible) responses were studied
   by exposing twoSymbiodiniumspecies with different levels of
   photosynthesis-respiration interaction to high temperature conditions
   (32 degrees C) for 1 yr. We found that some Symbiodiniaceae have a high
   level of energetic coupling; that is, photosynthesis and respiration
   have the same temperature dependency, and photosynthesis is negatively
   affected when respiration is inhibited. Conversely, photosynthesis and
   respiration are not coupled in other species. In any case, prolonged
   exposure to high temperature caused adjustments in both photosynthesis
   and respiration, but these changes were fully reversible. We conclude
   that energetic coupling between photosynthesis and respiration exhibits
   wide variation amongst Symbiodiniaceae and does not determine the
   occurrence of adaptive responses in Symbiodiniaceae to temperature
   increase.},

Title = {A Diver-Portable Respirometry System for <i>in</i>-<i>situ</i>
   Short-Term Measurements of Coral Metabolic Health and Rates of
   Calcification},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {NOV 12},
Abstract = {Underwater visual monitoring methods are used broadly to evaluate coral
   reef conditions in the natural environment, but quantitative
   measurements of the coral holobiont has been largely restricted to
   photophysiological assessment of the endosymbionts. An underwater
   respirometer has been designed to make routine, diver-operated,
   non-invasive measurements at coral surfaces, but the realistic in situ
   accuracy and precision capabilities of this device has not been
   critically assessed; an essential step if these measurements are to be
   useful for quantifying spatial and seasonal patterns of coral
   metabolism. We developed specific protocols for this system to survey
   shallow coral colonies and detect metabolic profiles (respiration,
   photosynthesis, and biocalcification), diel cycles (day and night), and
   photosynthesis-irradiance curves. Analysis of data from in situ and
   laboratory-controlled conditions showed good replication among coral
   colonies and high precision measurements of temperature, oxygen and pH
   fluxes over 15-min incubation times without noticeable detrimental
   effects on coral health. Moreover, marked differences were observed in
   coral calcification rates between estuarine-influenced and coastal
   marine conditions, despite the absence of significant differences in
   visual appearance or other health indicators, revealing the system's
   potential for early detection of marginally adverse conditions for coral
   metabolism. Its ease of operation and rapid quantification of the
   physiological status of the corals make this respirometer well suited
   for use by reef scientists, monitoring agencies, and stakeholders in
   biogenic reefs conservation efforts. Moreover, the high spatial and
   temporal resolution of these underwater respirometer data will have the
   potential to discriminate the effects of local stressors on coral health
   from those generated by broader changes associated with climate drivers.},

Abstract = {Understanding how rising seawater pCO(2) and temperatures impact coral
   aragonite accretion is essential for predicting the future of reef
   ecosystems. Here, we report 2 long-term (10-11 month) studies assessing
   the effects of temperature (25 and 28 degrees C) and both high and low
   seawater pCO(2) (180-750 mu atm) on the calcification, photosynthesis
   and respiration of individual massive Porites spp. genotypes.
   Calcification rates were highly variable between genotypes, but high
   seawater pCO(2) reduced calcification significantly in 4 of 7 genotypes
   cultured at 25 degrees C but in only 1 of 4 genotypes cultured at 28
   degrees C. Increasing seawater temperature enhanced calcification in
   almost all corals, but the magnitude of this effect was seawater pCO(2)
   dependent. The 3 degrees C temperature increase enhanced calcification
   rate on average by 3\% at 180 mu atm, by 35\% at 260 mu atm and by >
   300\% at 750 mu atm. The rate increase at high seawater pCO(2) exceeds
   that observed in inorganic aragonites. Responses of gross/net
   photosynthesis and respiration to temperature and seawater pCO(2) varied
   between genotypes, but rates of all these processes were reduced at the
   higher seawater temperature. Increases in seawater temperature, below
   the thermal stress threshold, may mitigate against ocean acidification
   in this coral genus, but this moderation is not mediated by an increase
   in net photosynthesis. The response of coral calcification to
   temperature cannot be explained by symbiont productivity or by
   thermodynamic and kinetic influences on aragonite formation.},

Title = {Nitrate competition in a coral symbiosis varies with temperature among
   <i>Symbiodinium</i> clades},
Journal = {ISME JOURNAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1248-1251},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Many reef-building corals form symbioses with dinoflagellates from the
   diverse genus Symbiodinium. There is increasing evidence of functional
   significance to Symbiodinium diversity, which affects the coral
   holobiont's response to changing environmental conditions. For example,
   corals hosting Symbiodinium from the clade D taxon exhibit greater
   resistance to heat-induced coral bleaching than conspecifics hosting the
   more common clade C. Yet, the relatively low prevalence of clade D
   suggests that this trait is not advantageous in non-stressful
   environments. Thus, clade D may only be able to out-compete other
   Symbiodinium types within the host habitat when conditions are
   chronically stressful. Previous studies have observed enhanced
   photosynthesis and fitness by clade C holobionts at non-stressful
   temperatures, relative to clade D. Yet, carbon-centered metrics cannot
   account for enhanced growth rates and patterns of symbiont succession to
   other genetic types when nitrogen often limits reef productivity. To
   investigate the metabolic costs of hosting thermally tolerant symbionts,
   we examined the assimilation and translocation of inorganic N-15 and
   C-13 in the coral Acropora tenuis experimentally infected with either
   clade C (sub-type C1) or D Symbiodinium at 28 and 30 degrees C. We show
   that at 28 degrees C, C1 holobionts acquired 22\% more N-15 than clade
   D. However, at 30 degrees C, C1 symbionts acquired equivalent nitrogen
   and 16\% less carbon than D. We hypothesize that C1 competitively
   excludes clade D in hospite via enhanced nitrogen acquisition and thus
   dominates coral populations despite warming oceans.},

Title = {Low levels of ultra-violet radiation mitigate the deleterious effects of

Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {167},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Reef ecosystems are under increasing pressure from global and local
   stressors. Rising seawater temperature and high ultraviolet radiation
   (UVR) levels are the main drivers of the disruption of the
   coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis (bleaching). Bleaching can also be
   exacerbated by nitrate contamination in coastal reefs. However, the
   underlying physiological mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here,
   we assessed the physiological and oxidative state of the scleractinian
   coral Pocillopora damicornis, maintained eight weeks in a
   crossed-factorial design including two temperatures (26 degrees C or 30
   degrees C), and two nitrate (0.5 and 3 mu M-enriched), and UVR (no UVR
   and 25/ 1.5 Wm(-2) UVA/B) levels. Nitrate enrichment, and high
   temperature, significantly impaired coral photosynthesis. However, UVR
   alleviated the nitrate and temperature-induced decrease in
   photosynthesis, by increasing the coral's antioxidant capacity. The
   present study contributes to our understanding of the combined effects
   of abiotic stressors on coral bleaching susceptibility. Such information
   is urgently needed to refine reef management strategies.},

Title = {Photosynthetic response of the Mediterranean zooxanthellate coral

Abstract = {We investigated photoacclimation in the symbiotic Mediterranean coral
   Cladocora caespitosa by exposing it to three light levels (30, 80 and
   250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), which are in the range of those recorded for
   this species. The coral response to a change in both light and
   temperature was also assessed, by subjecting coral to two treatments
   corresponding to winter (14 C and 30 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and summer (23
   C and 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) conditions, as measured in the Ligurian
   Sea. Photosynthesis, measured using both respirometry and pulse
   amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry, revealed a linear relationship
   only at low light levels. At higher irradiance, relative electron
   transport rate (rETR) approached saturation more slowly than rates of
   oxygen production. At constant temperature, a change in light did not
   induce any change in zooxanthellae (zoox) and chlorophyll (Chl a+c(2))
   concentrations (mean 3.7x10(6) zoox cm(-2) and 14.1 mu g cm(-2),
   respectively); however, chlorophyll concentrations significantly
   increased under low light and temperature, probably in order to maintain
   a sufficient level of autotrophy. Maximal gross photosynthesis (Pg(max))
   as well as the saturation irradiance (E(k)) and the respiration rate (R)
   were, however, significantly higher at 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) compared
   to the lower light treatments, independently of temperature conditions.
   Acclimation to high light appeared to be partly driven by a change in
   the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) capacity of the algal cells, and
   to a maximal rate of photon utilization. Conversely, under low light
   conditions, coral polyps presented a lower E(k), but also lower
   respiration rates, which correspond to a decrease in the energy
   expenditure. This ability to acclimate to different light conditions,
   might allow C. caespitosa to rapidly regulate its autotrophic rate in
   the different light conditions encountered in its natural habitats.},

Title = {Full-Length Transcriptomics Reveal the Gene Expression Profiles of
   Reef-Building Coral <i>Pocillopora damicornis</i> and Symbiont
   Zooxanthellae},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Since the last century, episodes of coral reef bleaching and mortality
   have occurred almost annually in tropical or subtropical seas. When the
   temperature exceeds the tolerant limit of a coral-zooxanthellae
   holobiont, it induces physiological stress and disrupts the vulnerable
   fine-tuned balance between the two partners, leading to bleaching. The
   gene expression profiles of a scleractinian coral and its symbiotic
   zooxanthellae can offer important information with which to decipher
   this balanced relationship at the functional level of genes. Here, we
   sequence a full-length transcriptome of a well-known, common and
   frequently dominant reef-building coral, Pocillopora damicornis, to
   acquire gene expression information for the coral-zooxanthellae
   holobiont. To this end, we identify 21,926 and 465 unique genes in the
   coral and algal symbiont, respectively, and examine the functional
   enrichment among these genes based on GO (gene ontology) terms and KEGG
   (the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways. The results show
   that the zooxanthellae provide for their coral host through energy and
   nutrition metabolism by photosynthesis, and that both the coral host and
   zooxanthellae have an anti-stress molecular mechanism, though the two
   parties have independent abilities to survive in the short term. This
   work sheds light on the valuable gene expression profile of a
   coral-zooxanthellae holobiont and provides grounds for further molecular
   biological research to support ecological protection work.},

Title = {Symbiont genotype influences holobiont response to increased temperature},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {As coral reefs face warming oceans and increased coral bleaching, a
   whitening of the coral due to loss of microalgal endosymbionts, the
   possibility of evolutionary rescue offers some hope for reef
   persistence. In tightly linked mutualisms, evolutionary rescue may occur
   through evolution of the host and/or endosymbionts. Many obligate
   mutualisms are composed of relatively small, fast-growing symbionts with
   greater potential to evolve on ecologically relevant time scales than
   their relatively large, slower growing hosts. Numerous jellyfish species
   harbor closely related endosymbiont taxa to other cnidarian species such
   as coral, and are commonly used as a model system for investigating
   cnidarian mutualisms. We examined the potential for adaptation of the
   upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea xamachana to increased temperature via
   evolution of its microalgal endosymbiont, Symbiodinium microadriaticum.
   We quantified trait variation among five algal genotypes in response to
   three temperatures (26 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 32 degrees C) and
   fitness of hosts infected with each genotype. All genotypes showed
   positive growth rates at each temperature, but rates of respiration and
   photosynthesis decreased with increased temperature. Responses varied
   among genotypes but were unrelated to genetic similarity. The effect of
   temperature on asexual reproduction and the timing of development in the
   host also depended on the genotype of the symbiont. Natural selection
   could favor different algal genotypes at different temperatures,
   affecting host fitness. This eco-evolutionary interaction may be a
   critical component of understanding species resilience in increasingly
   stressful environments.},

Title = {High light alongside elevated <i>P</i><sub>CO</sub><sub>2</sub>
   alleviates thermal depression of photosynthesis in a hard coral
   (<i>Pocillopora acuta</i>)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {223},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The absorbtion of human-emitted CO2 by the oceans (elevated P-CO2) is
   projected to alter the physiological performance of coral reef organisms
   by perturbing seawater chemistry (i.e. ocean acidification).
   Simultaneously, greenhouse gas emissions are driving ocean warming and
   changes in irradiance (through turbidity and cloud cover), which have
   the potential to influence the effects of ocean acidification on coral
   reefs. Here, we explored whether physiological impacts of elevated
   P-CO2, on a coral-algal symbiosis (Pocillopora acuta-Symbiodiniaceae)
   are mediated by light and/or temperature levels. In a 39 day experiment,
   elevated P-CO2 (962 versus 431 patm P-CO2) had an interactive effect
   with midday light availability (400 versus 800 pmol photons m(-2) s(-1))
   and temperature (25 versus 29 degrees C) on areal gross and net
   photosynthesis, for which a decline at 29 degrees C was ameliorated
   under simultaneous high-Pm and high-light conditions. Light-enhanced
   dark respiration increased under elevated P-CO2 and/or elevated
   temperature. Symbiont to host cell ratio and chlorophyll a per symbiont
   increased at elevated temperature, whilst symbiont areal density
   decreased. The ability of moderately strong light in the presence of
   elevated P-CO2 to alleviate the temperature-induced decrease in
   photosynthesis suggests that higher substrate availability facilitates a
   greater ability for photochemical quenching, partially offsetting the
   impacts of high temperature on the photosynthetic apparatus. Future
   environmental changes that result in moderate increases in light levels
   could therefore assist the P. acuta holobiont to cope with the `one-two
   punch' of rising temperatures in the presence of an acidifying ocean.},

Abstract = {Temperate organisms are generally exposed to a more variable and cooler
   climate than tropical organisms, and are therefore expected to have
   broader thermal tolerance and a different thermal performance curve.
   This study investigated these hypotheses by comparing the thermal
   performance of two common tropical coral species found in the Great
   Barrier Reef with the two most common temperate coral species from the
   Mediterranean Sea. Photosynthesis rates, dark respiration rates, maximum
   PSII quantum yield (F-v/F-m) and electron transport rates (rETR(m)) were
   measured on coral fragments exposed to an acute temperature increase and
   decrease up to 5 degrees C above and below the average environmental
   seawater temperature. Dark respiration rates and F-v/F-m increased
   linearly with temperature, suggesting broad thermal tolerance. For
   photosynthesis and rETR(m), the performance breadths were surprisingly
   similar between the tropical and temperate species. However, the thermal
   optimum for performance was generally below the local average
   temperature, and only coincided with the prevailing environmental
   temperature for one of the tropical species. The broad thermal tolerance
   for photosynthesis displayed in this study supports previous
   observations that corals can survive short periods of abnormally warm
   temperatures and suggests that corals adopt thermal generalist
   strategies to cope with temperature variation in the environment.
   Nevertheless, current mean temperatures are 10-30\% above the thermal
   optimum for the species studied here, demonstrating that conditions are
   already pushing the boundaries of coral thermal tolerance.},

Abstract = {Global- and local-scale anthropogenic stressors have been the main
   drivers of coral reef decline, causing shifts in coral reef community
   composition and ecosystem functioning. Excess nutrient enrichment can
   make corals more vulnerable to ocean warming by suppressing
   calcification and reducing photosynthetic performance. However, in some
   environments, corals can exhibit higher growth rates and thermal
   performance in response to nutrient enrichment. In this study, we
   measured how chronic nutrient enrichment at low concentrations affected
   coral physiology, including endosymbiont and coral host response
   variables, and holobiont metabolic responses of Pocillopora spp.
   colonies in Mo'orea, French Polynesia. We experimentally enriched corals
   with dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate for 15 months on an
   oligotrophic fore reef in Mo'orea. We first characterized symbiont and
   coral physiological traits due to enrichment and then used thermal
   performance curves to quantify the relationship between metabolic rates
   and temperature for experimentally enriched and control coral colonies.
   We found that endosymbiont densities and total tissue biomass were 54\%
   and 22\% higher in nutrient-enriched corals, respectively, relative to
   controls. Algal endosymbiont nitrogen content cell(-1) was 44\% lower in
   enriched corals relative to the control colonies. In addition, thermal
   performance metrics indicated that the maximal rate of performance for
   gross photosynthesis was 29\% higher and the rate of oxygen evolution at
   a reference temperature (26.8 degrees C) for gross photosynthesis was
   33\% higher in enriched colonies compared to the control colonies. These
   differences were not attributed to symbiont community composition
   between corals in different treatments, as C42, a symbiont type in the
   Cladocopium genus, was the dominant endosymbiont type found in all
   corals. Together, our results show that in an oligotrophic fore reef
   environment, nutrient enrichment can cause changes in coral endosymbiont
   physiology that increase the performance of the coral holobiont.},

Title = {The effect of temperature stress on coral-Symbiodinium associations
   containing distinct symbiont types},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {473-485},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Several studies have demonstrated that the temperature tolerance of
   scleractinian reef-building corals is controlled, in part, by hosting
   physiologically distinct symbiotic algae. We investigated the thermal
   tolerance of coral-algal associations within seven common species of
   reef-building corals hosting distinct Symbiodinium sub-clades collected
   from Heron Island during experimentally induced bleaching conditions.
   During experimental heating, photosynthetic fitness was assessed by the
   dark-adapted yield of PSII (F (v)/F (m)), and excitation pressure across
   PSII (Q (m)) of each coral-algal association using pulse amplitude
   modulation fluorometry. The onset of bleaching was determined by the
   measurement of Symbiodinium cell density. Using the ribosomal internal
   transcribed spacer 2 (ITS-2) region, we showed that Symbiodinium
   type-coral host associations were temporally and spatially conserved in
   a high proportion of the colonies sampled within each species.
   Generally, the species Acropora millepora, Platygyra daedalea, Acropora
   aspera and Acropora formosa contained Symbiodinium ITS-2 type C3,
   whereas the species Montipora digitata, Porites cylindrica and Porites
   lutea contained Symbiodinium type C15. Bleaching susceptibility showed
   some association with Symbiodinium type, but further research is
   required to confirm this. Corals hosting C3 Symbiodinium displayed
   higher reductions in F (v)/F (m) during heating compared to their C15
   counterparts, irrespective of host species. However, a corresponding
   reduction in Symbiodinium density was not observed. Nonetheless, A.
   aspera and A. formosa showed significant reductions in Symbiodinium
   density relative to controls. This correlated with large increases in Q
   (m) and decreases in F (v)/F (m) in heated explants. Our results suggest
   a range of bleaching susceptibilities for the coral species
   investigated, with A. aspera and A. formosa showing the greatest
   susceptibility to bleaching and M. digitata showing the lowest bleaching
   susceptibility. The data provide strong evidence for distinct
   differences in temperature tolerance between C3 and C15 Symbiodinium
   types when in-hospite; however, future studies addressing the
   confounding effect of host species would help to confirm this.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {440},
Pages = {54-60},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Bleaching affects corals worldwide. We studied the effects of high
   seawater temperature and bacterial challenges on bleaching, metabolism,
   and antioxidant defenses of coral. The coral Montipora digitate and five
   bacterial strains (Vibrio coralliilyticus, Vibrio harveyi, Paracoccus
   carotinifaciens, Pseudoalteromonas sp., and Sulfitobacter sp.) were used
   in an inoculation experiment. The bacteria were isolated from the
   bleached corals and their surrounding seawater. At normal temperatures,
   the bacteria did not cause coral bleaching and did not affect metabolism
   or antioxidant enzyme activities. However, bacterial challenges in
   addition to high-temperature stress resulted in coral bleaching, with a
   70\% decrease in zooxanthellae density compared with the control, a 25\%
   decrease in photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm), a 66\% decrease in
   photosynthesis, and a 101\% reduction in calcification activity. Tissue
   necrosis was observed in the most compromised branches. Respiration and
   activity levels of antioxidant enzymes were not affected. Corals under
   thermal stress alone showed signs of bleaching, but the changes in
   zooxanthellae density and metabolic rates were less severe than those
   under synergistic thermal stress and bacterial challenge. Among the
   bacteria examined, Sulfitobacter sp. had a greater capacity to enhance
   and accelerate the bleaching process under thermal stress. The
   mechanisms by which bacteria affect corals are not yet understood.
   Direct actions include infection and production of toxic substances by
   bacteria; indirect effects due to changes in the bacterial community
   under the influence of added bacteria must also be considered. Our
   results suggest that bacterial challenges combined with thermal stress
   can synergistically lead to negative outcomes in corals. (C) 2012

Abstract = {Coral reefs are on the brink of collapse from global warming and
   associated coral bleaching. Coral bleaching is the loss of algal
   symbionts from the coral tissue. The reduction in photosynthates
   produced by the symbionts makes the survival of the coral dependent on
   heterotrophy and stored resources, which are catabolized into available
   energy, i.e., Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). The present study examined
   how an increase in water temperature affects energetic reserves and
   available ATP in the Red Sea coral Stylophora pistillata. Following a
   9-d hold at 1, 3, 5 degrees C above ambient summer temperature (similar
   to 26 degrees C), ATP levels in the coral tissue remained constant.
   Similarly, no significant differences in the stored energy (proteins,
   carbohydrates, and lipids) of the holobiont were measured. However, half
   of the coral nubbins in the + 7 degrees C treatment experienced tissue
   dissociation, while the remaining nubbins bleached with a 34\% decline
   in stored energy and a decline in respiration and photosynthesis rates
   by 69 and 72\%, respectively. The + 7 degrees C treated coral nubbins
   had 75\% lower carbohydrates compared to nubbins at ambient conditions
   and the lowest carbohydrates to lipid and protein ratio. This study
   demonstrates that exceeding the high bleaching threshold of S.
   pistillata in the Gulf of Aqaba is associated with a catabolic response
   to maintain ATP levels and highlights the energetic cost of thermal
   stress. Understanding anabolic and catabolic processes in corals under
   environmental stress is key to understanding their capacity to survive
   future thermal stress scenarios.},

Title = {Catastrophic mortality on inshore coral reefs of the Florida Keys due to

Abstract = {Coral reefs of the Florida Keys typically experience seasonal
   temperatures of 20-31 degrees C. Deviation outside this range causes
   physiological impairment of reef-building corals, potentially leading to
   coral colony death. In January and February 2010, two closely spaced
   cold fronts, possibly driven by an unusually extreme Arctic Oscillation,
   caused sudden and severe seawater temperature declines in the Florida
   Keys. Inshore coral reefs {[}e. g., Admiral Reef (ADM)] experienced
   lower sustained temperatures (i.e., < 12 degrees C) than those further
   offshore {[}e. g., Little Grecian Reef (LG), minimum temperature = 17.2
   degrees C]. During February and March 2010, we surveyed ADM and observed
   a mass die-off of reef-building corals, whereas 12 km away LG did not
   exhibit coral mortality. We subsequently measured the physiological
   effects of low-temperature stress on three common reef-building corals
   (i.e., Montastraea faveolata, Porites astreoides, and Siderastrea
   siderea) over a range of temperatures that replicated the inshore
   cold-water anomaly (i.e., from 20 to 16 to 12 degrees C and back to 20
   degrees C). Throughout the temperature modulations, coral respiration as
   well as endosymbiont gross photosynthesis and maximum quantum efficiency
   of photosystem II were measured. In addition, Symbiodinium genotypic
   identity, cell densities, and chlorophyll a content were determined at
   the beginning and conclusion of the experiment. All corals were
   significantly affected at 12 degrees C, but species-specific
   physiological responses were found indicating different coral and/or
   Symbiodinium cold tolerances. Montastraea faveolata and P. astreoides
   appeared to be most negatively impacted because, upon return to 20
   degrees C, significant reductions in gross photosynthesis and dark
   respiration persisted. Siderastrea siderea, however, readily recovered
   to pre-treatment rates of dark respiration and gross photosynthesis.
   Visual surveys of inshore reefs corroborated these results, with S.
   siderea being minimally affected by the cold-water anomaly, whereas M.
   faveolata and P. astreoides exhibited nearly 100\% mortality. This study
   highlights the importance of understanding the physiological attributes
   of genotypically distinct coral-Symbiodinium symbioses that contribute
   to tolerance, recovery, and consequences to an environmental
   perturbation. These data also document effects of a rarely studied
   environmental stressor, possibly initiated by remote global climate
   events, on coral-Symbiodinium symbioses and coral reef communities.},

Title = {Heating rate explains species-specific coral bleaching severity during a
   simulated marine heatwave},

Abstract = {Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are becoming more frequent as a consequence of
   climate change. These discrete events are causing widespread stress and
   mortality in marine ecosystems, including coral reefs. The heat
   tolerance of different coral species is often complex and depends on a
   combination of environmental and biological factors, making accurate
   predictions of the impact of MHWs on individual species challenging.
   Heating rate has been shown to influence coral bleaching in Acropora
   species, but it remains unknown how heating rate influences bleaching in
   other corals with contrasting morphology and bleaching sensitivities. In
   this study, we explored the sensitivity of Pocillopora damicornis and
   Plesiastrea versipora, representing branching and encrusting growth
   forms, respectively, to heating rate. We experimentally simulated MHWs
   with slow (0.5 degrees C d-1) and fast (1 degrees C d-1) heating rates
   and measured physiological responses to quantify changes in coral
   health, including photochemical efficiency, holobiont metabolism, tissue
   biomass, chl a, and symbiont density. Our results confirm that heating
   rate is a good predictor of coral bleaching sensitivity for these
   species, with faster heating rates causing more severe bleaching and
   declines in coral health. However, bleaching sensitivity differed
   between P. damicornis and P. versipora, with P. damicornis more affected
   by the faster heating rate. The use of heating rate, in addition to
   other metrics such as duration and intensity of heat, will enhance our
   capacity to predict the local impact of MHW events and their overarching
   ecological consequences for coral ecosystems.},

Title = {Photosynthesis and photosynthetic electron transport in the soft coral
   Sarcophyton spp},
Journal = {SCIENCEASIA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {49},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Blue-diode Pulse Amplitude Fluorometry (PAM) and rapid light curves,
   fitted using the Waiting-in-Line equation, were used to measure
   photosynthetic electron transport rate (ETR) of the common soft coral
   Sarcophyton spp (Alcyoniidae, Cnidaria). Optimum irradiance (Eopt) of
   newly-collected material was 353 +/- 28.9 mu mol quanta m-2s-1 (RI18\%
   sunlight, 400-700 nm), 1/2 optimum irradiance (E1/2-ETR) RI82.0 mu mol
   quanta m-2s-1 with substantial photoinhibition at higher irradiances.
   Maximum ETR (ETRmax) = 25.1 +/- 1.28 mu mole- m-2s-1 (surface area
   basis) or 86.8 +/- 4.44 mu mole- g-1 Chl a s-1 (Chl a basis). Due to
   strong midday inhibition total daily photosynthesis would be greater on
   cloudy days, during the overcast wet season and high tides. Open
   aquarium-grown material had Eopt RI300 mu mol quanta m-2s-1; ETRmax RI21
   mu mole- m-2s-1 or RI50 mu mole- g-1 Chl a s-1. Chl a was RI300 (field
   material) vs. RI450 (aquaculture aquarium) mg m-2 but with no change in
   Chl c2/a ratio (0.521 +/- 0.0181). Based on light/dark O2 electrode
   methods in aquaria Gross Photosynthesis (Pg) = 21.9 +/- 6.85 mu mol O2
   g-1 Chl a s-1, Pnet = 15.1 +/- 6.38 mu mol O2 g-1 Chl a s-1; respiration
   -6.81 +/- 2.23 mu mol O2 g-1 Chl a s-1; P/R ratio = 3.72 +/- 1.86 at an
   irradiance 192 +/- 20.3 mu mol quanta m-2s-1. The culturable
   dinoflagellate zooxanthellae material might not necessarily be
   representative of the resident zooxanthellae population. Their PAM
   characteristics were similar to the soft coral (Eopt RI219 mu mol quanta
   m-2s-1, ETRmax RI138 mu mol e- g-1 Chl a s-1), but the Chl c2/a ratio
   (RI0.16) was very different.},

Title = {Bacterial communities of juvenile corals infected with different
   <i>Symbiodinium</i> (dinoflagellate) clades},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {389},
Pages = {45-59},
Abstract = {The coral holobiont consists of the host and its microbial partners,
   including the dinoflagellate endosymbiont Symbiodinium and bacteria
   living both on and within coral tissues. Although genetically different,
   Symbiodinium types have been shown to differentially affect the
   physiology of the coral host; their effects on the bacterial partners in
   the association are unknown. The present study compares profiles of the
   bacterial communities associated with juvenile corals of Acropora
   millepora and A. tenuis that had been experimentally infected with 2
   different clades of Symbiodinium, Clade C1 and D, to investigate
   possible interactions between bacterial and Symbiodinium communities.
   Three culture-independent 16S rRNA gene profiling methods (clone library
   construction, terminal restriction length polymorphism and denaturing
   gradient gel electrophoresis) revealed no discernible pattern in
   bacterial communities on 9 mo old juvenile corals containing different
   clades of zooxanthellae, suggesting that coral-associated bacteria are
   not linked to Symbiodinium types in hospite in early ontogeny. In
   contrast to bacterial profiles of adult corals, bacterial communities
   associated with juvenile corals were highly variable, indicating that
   bacterial associates are not conserved in these early stages. When 12 mo
   old juveniles were sampled again in summer, bacteria I communities
   associated with A. tenuis hosting Clade D Symbiodinium were dominated by
   sequences affiliating with Vibrio species, indicating that corals
   harbouring this symbiont may be more susceptible to temperature stress,
   allowing growth of opportunistic microbial community members possibly
   detrimental to coral health.},

Abstract = {Metabolic activity, defined as the sum of organismal processes that
   involve energy, is of critical importance in understanding the function
   and evolution of life on earth. Measuring organismal metabolic rates is,
   therefore, at the center of explaining the physiological states of
   organisms, their ecological roles, and the impact of environmental
   change on species within terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. On coral
   reefs, measures of metabolism have been used to quantify symbiosis
   functioning between corals and their obligate algal symbionts
   (Symbiodiniaceae), as well as assess how environmental stressors,
   including climate change, will impact coral health. Despite this
   significance, there is a lack of methods, and therefore data, relating
   to metabolic rate measurements in coral offspring, likely due to their
   small size. To address this gap, this study aimed to develop a custom
   setup for measuring the respiration of small (millimeter size range)
   marine animal ecologies. This low cost and easy setup should allow for
   the improved measurement of metabolic rate. This will be essential for
   applied ecological research utilizing the sexual production of corals

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {301},
Pages = {109-118},
Abstract = {While photosynthesis of symbiotic algae is essential for reef-building
   corals, excess irradiance inhibits photosynthesis through
   photoinhibition, which can lead to coral bleaching under elevated
   temperature conditions. Here we show that water flow reduces
   photoinhibition of in hospite endosymbionts in the coral Acropora
   digitifera. Diurnal monitoring of chlorophyll fluorescence, under 2
   different flow regimes (< 3 and 20 cm s(-1) flow rates) in an outdoor
   aquarium, showed reduced photoinhibition, but only under moderate flow
   conditions (20 cm s-1). Experimental (laboratory) measurements, on time
   scales ranging from minutes to hours, showed that flow-mediated
   reductions in photoinhibition occurred not by enhancing recovery of the
   damaged photosystem, but rather through inducing differential
   photodamage. Moreover, experiments involving sequential light
   oscillations (500/20 and 1000/20 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) at 3 flow
   regimes, < 3, 10, and 20 cm s(-1), on a time scale ranging from hours to
   days, revealed water-velocity-dependent reductions of dynamic
   photoinhibition. These results, on time scales ranging from minutes to
   weeks, confirm that reduced water flow amplifies photodamage of algal
   photosynthesis under strong irradiance, which in turn affects coral
   tolerance to strong irradiance and temperature.},

Abstract = {Establishing the thermal reaction norm of coral larvae under elevated
   pCO(2) is crucial to anticipate how larval dispersal and population
   maintenance may be affected by future climate change. Here, we
   characterized the functional relationship between temperature (27-33
   degrees C) and larval performance of the reef coral Pocillopora
   damicornis under two pCO(2) levels. The results showed that the
   temperature threshold of larvae was between 32 and 33 degrees C, as
   evidenced by the abrupt declines in photochemical efficiency and
   symbiont density, whereas no oxidative damage was observed between 27
   and 33 degrees C and elevated pCO(2) did not influence any of these
   parameters. In addition, larval respiration and photosynthesis rates
   exhibited parabolic responses to temperature, and this relationship
   conformed to the Gaussian-Gompertz model with an optimal temperature
   around 31.5 degrees C, which was approximately 2.5 degrees C above the
   summer mean temperature, suggesting the potential for thermal
   acclimation. Most importantly, elevated pCO(2) significantly enhanced
   the larval photosynthesis and the stimulatory effect of elevated pCO(2)
   on the photosynthetic rates and capacity was more pronounced in cool and
   warm temperatures, indicative of shifted thermal sensitivity under high
   pCO(2). These results suggest that ocean acidification could alter the
   thermal performance curves and tolerance window of brooded P. damicornis
   larvae, with profound and important implications for larval ecology in a
   future changing ocean.},

Title = {Photosynthetic responses of the coral <i>Montipora digitata</i> to cold
   temperature stress},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {248},
Pages = {85-97},
Abstract = {Coral bleaching events have become more frequent and widespread, largely
   due to elevated sea surface temperatures. Global climate change could
   lead to increased variability of sea surface temperatures, through
   influences on climate systems, e.g. El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
   Field observations in 1999, following a strong ENSO, revealed that
   corals bleached in winter after unusually cold weather. To explore the
   basis for these observations, the photosynthetic responses of the coral
   species Montipora digitata Studer were investigated in a series of
   temperature and light experiments. Small replicate coral colonies were
   exposed to ecologically relevant lower temperatures for varying
   durations and under light regimes that ranged from darkness to full
   sunlight. Photosynthetic efficiency was analyzed using a pulse amplitude
   modulated (PAM) fluorometer (F-0, F-m, F-v/F-m), and chlorophyll a (chl
   a) content and symbiotic dinoflagellate density were analyzed with
   spectrophotometry and microscopy, respectively. Cold temperature stress
   had a negative impact on M digitata colonies indicated by decreased
   photosynthetic efficiency (F-v/F-m), loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates
   and changes in photosynthetic pigment concentrations. Corals in higher
   light regimes were more susceptible to cold temperature stress, Moderate
   cold stress resulted in photoacclimatory responses, but severe cold
   stress resulted in photodamage, bleaching and increased mortality.
   Responses to cold temperature stress of M digitata appeared similar to
   that observed in corals exposed to warmer than normal temperatures,
   suggesting a common mechanism. The results of this study suggest that
   corals and coral reefs may also be impacted by exposure to cold as well
   as warm temperature extremes as climate change occurs.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium, the endosymbiont of reef
   corals, play an important role in coral-bleaching events which can be
   induced by prolonged enhanced seawater temperature anomalies, and which
   are predicted to occur at increasing frequencies and severities due to
   global warming. The genus Symbiodinium exhibits high genetic diversity
   with physiological variation within and among species, leading to a
   range of thermal tolerance. Although these variations have been examined
   in individual species, comprehensive comparative experimental data
   across several species are still rare. Therefore, in the present study,
   the photophysiological and thermal response patterns of six genetically
   characterized Symbiodinium genotypes were comparatively investigated.
   The six Symbiodinium genotypes were isolated from four different host
   species from the following biogeographic locations: Hawaii (Central
   Pacific), Panama (Caribbean), Florida (Caribbean), and Palau (West
   Pacific). Photosynthesis-irradiance curve and growth measurements at
   temperatures ranging from 20 to 33 A degrees C were carried out. All
   physiological data clearly indicate significant differences in the
   response patterns of the six Symbiodinium genotypes. While some types
   photosynthesized, respired, and grew at 33 A degrees C, others showed a
   partial or complete inhibition. The genotype-specific response over the
   experimental temperature reveals the potential range response of a given
   symbiont and variation between strains that adaptation might act upon.},

Title = {Quantitative interpretation of vertical profiles of calcium and pH in
   the coral coelenteron},
Journal = {MARINE CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {204},
Pages = {62-69},
Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {Scleratinian corals (hard corals) and their symbiotic algae are the
   ecological engineers of biodiverse and geological important coral reef
   habitats. The complex, linked physiological processes that enable the
   holobiont (coral + algae) to calcify and generate reef structures are
   consequently of great interest. However, the mechanism of calcification
   is difficult to study for several reasons including the small spatial
   scales of the processes and the close coupling between the symbiont and
   host. In this study, we explore the utility of pH and Ca2+
   microelectrodes for constraining the rates and spatial distribution of
   photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification. The work focuses on
   vertical profiles of pH and Ca2+ through the coelenteron cavity, a
   semi-isolated compartment of modified seawater amenable to quantitative
   interpretation. In two studied species, Turbincuia reniformis and
   Acropora nallepora, Ca2+ concentrations decreased in a roughly linear
   manner from the mouth to the base of the coelenteron, indicating the
   primary physiological process affecting Ca2+ concentration is removal
   for calcification below the coelenteron. In contrast, the H+
   concentration remained relatively constant over much of the coelenteron
   cavity before it increased sharply toward the base of the coelenteron,
   indicative of proton-pumping from the calcification fluid below. The
   estimated H+ gradient between the coelenteron cavity and the
   calcification site was > 10 times higher than previously predicted.
   Consequently, the energy required to export protons from the calcifying
   fluid was estimated to be similar to 3 times higher than previously
   calculated. A one-dimensional reaction-diffusion model was used to
   interpret the pH profile considering the effects of photosynthesis,
   respiration, and calcification. This model provided a good fit to the
   observed pH profile and helped to constrain the rates and spatial
   distribution of these processes. Our modeling results also suggested
   that adult corals with deeper polyps may be more sensitive to ocean
   acidification (OA) because of enhanced difficulty to transport H+ out of
   the coelenteron and into the surrounding seawater.},

Abstract = {Given the widespread threats to coral reefs, scientists have lost the
   opportunity to understand the basic biology of ``pristine{''} corals
   whose physiologies have not been markedly perturbed by human activity.
   For instance, high temperature-induced bleaching has been occurring
   annually since 2014 in New Caledonia. Because most corals cannot
   withstand repeated years when bleaching occurs, an analysis was
   undertaken to showcase coral behavior in a period just before the onset
   of ``annual severe bleaching{''} (ASB; November 2013) such that future
   generations might know how these corals functioned in their last
   bleaching-free year. Pocillopora damicornis colonies were sampled across
   a variety of environmental gradients, and a subset was sampled during
   both day and night to understand how their molecular biology changes
   upon cessation of dinoflagellate photosynthesis. Of the 13 environmental
   parameters tested, sampling time (i.e., light) most significantly
   affected coral molecular physiology, and expression levels of a number
   of both host and Symbiodiniaceae genes demonstrated significant diel
   variation; endosymbiont mRNA expression was more temporally variable
   than that of their anthozoan hosts. Furthermore, expression of all
   stress-targeted genes in both eukaryotic compartments of the holobiont
   was high, even in isolated, uninhabited, federally protected atolls of
   the country's far northwest. Whether this degree of sub-cellular stress
   reflects cumulative climate change impacts or, instead, a
   stress-hardened phenotype, will be unveiled through assessing the fates
   of these corals in the wake of increasingly frequent marine heatwaves.},

Abstract = {It is thought that the active physiological regulation of the chemistry
   of a parent fluid is an important process in the biomineralization of
   scleractinian corals. Biological regulation of calcification fluid pH
   (pH(CF)) and other carbonate chemistry parameters ({[}CO32-](CF), DICCF,
   and Omega(CF)) may be challenged by CO2 driven acidification and
   temperature. Here, we examine the combined influence of changing
   temperature and CO2 on calcifying fluid regulation in four common
   Caribbean coral species-Porites astreoides, Pseudodiploria strigosa,
   Undaria tenuifolia, and Siderastrea siderea. We utilize skeletal boron
   geochemistry (B/Ca and delta B-11) to probe the pH(CF), {[}CO32-](CF),
   and DICCF regulation in these corals, and delta C-13 to track changes in
   the sources of carbon for calcification. Temperature was found to not
   influence pH(CF) regulation across all pCO(2) treatments in these
   corals, in contrast to recent studies on Indo-Pacific pocilloporid
   corals. We find that {[}DIC](CF) is significantly lower at higher
   temperatures in all the corals, and that the higher temperature was
   associated with depletion of host energy reserves, suggesting
   {[}DIC](CF) reductions may result from reduced input of respired CO2 to
   the DIC pool for calcification. In addition, delta C-13 data suggest
   that under high temperature and CO2 conditions, algal symbiont
   photosynthesis continues to influence the calcification pool and is
   associated with low {[}DIC](CF) in P. strigosa and P. astreoides. In P.
   astreoides this effect is also associated with an increase in
   chlorophyll a concentration in coral tissues at higher temperatures.
   These observations collectively support the assertion that
   physicochemical control over coral calcifying fluid chemistry is coupled
   to host and symbiont physiological responses to environmental change,
   and reveals interspecific differences in the extent and nature of this
   coupling.},

Abstract = {In this paper I challenge the notion that a healthy and resilient coral
   is (in all cases) a fast-growing coral, and by inference, that a reef
   characterised by a fast trajectory toward high coral cover is
   necessarily a healthy and resilient reef. Instead, I explain how
   emerging evidence links fast skeletal extension rates with elevated
   coral-algae (symbiotic) respiration rates, most-often mediated by
   nutrient-enlarged symbiont populations and/or rising sea temperatures.
   Elevated respiration rates can act to reduce the autotrophic capacity
   (photosynthesis:respiration ratio) of the symbiosis. This restricts the
   capacity of the coral host to build and maintain sufficient energy
   reserves (e.g. lipids) needed to sustain essential homeostatic
   functions, including sexual reproduction and biophysical stress
   resistance. Moreover, it explains the somewhat paradoxical scenario,
   whereby at the ecological instant before the reef-building capacity of
   the symbiosis is lost, a reef can look visually at its best and be
   accreting CaCO3 at its maximum.},

Abstract = {This study experimentally investigated the effect of an early summer
   short-term summer thermal anomaly in November on Heron Reef (Great
   Barrier Reef), on the performance of the coral-algal symbiosis during a
   subsequent, thermally induced bleaching event (defined by loss of
   symbionts) in February 2009. Fragments of the reef flat coral, Acropora
   millepora, exposed to the two heating events lost 78\% of their
   symbionts and showed a 64\% decline in dark adapted quantum yield
   (Fv/Fm) to values less than 0.25. Whereas corals that were only heated
   in the second event lost 57\% symbionts and displayed a 75\% decline in
   Fv/Fm to values less than 0.2. Coral in both pre-stressed and non
   pre-stressed treatments at 34 degrees C had net photosynthetic rates
   significantly less than zero (P-net max<0), suggesting that daytime O-2
   respiration rates were significantly greater than rates of O-2 evolution
   through photosynthesis. Increases in the daily light field and/or
   increases in temperature led to the observation of dark-adapted
   xanthophyll de-epoxidation suggesting that the potential for
   non-photochemical quenching is maintained into the dark (after 1 h dark
   adaption). Pre-stressed corals were also found to have de-epoxidation
   ratios three times greater than non pre-stressed corals at 34 degrees C
   and xanthophyll pool to Chl a, much greater than non pre-stressed
   corals. Combined, these results indicate that symbionts in pre-stressed
   corals have a greater ability to dump incoming light energy as heat We
   conclude that whilst differences were observed between pre-stressed and
   non pre-stressed populations in measurements of photosynthetic
   productivity, photosynthetic pigments and areal protein, thermal
   bleaching as defined by symbiont loss did not vary between treatments.

Title = {Effect of copper on algal-host interactions in the symbiotic coral
   <i>Plesiastrea versipora</i>},
Journal = {PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {41},
Number = {4},
Pages = {383-390},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Blue and green morphs of the scleractinian coral Plesiastrea versipora
   were exposed to increasing amounts of copper for periods of 12 (0-5.04
   muM) to 36 d (two cycles of 0-7.55 muM). Algae were not expelled and
   there was no decrease in photosynthesis or chlorophyll a. Chlorophyll c
   decreased in only one out of four experiments. Total carotenoids
   increased in all the experiments. Two host signalling compounds that
   regulate algal carbon metabolism, host release factor (HRF) which
   stimulates algal photosynthate release, and photosynthesis inhibiting
   factor (PIF) which partially inhibits photosynthetic carbon fixation,
   were examined. PIF activity was slightly higher after 16 and 36 d of
   exposure to copper, but HRF activity was always similar to seawater
   control corals. Algae isolated from corals previously exposed to copper
   showed a variable response. In one experiment (12 d exposure), algae
   were not inhibited by PIF and stimulation by HRF was lower than in algae
   isolated from seawater control corals. In another experiment (36 d
   exposure), algae still responded to HRF but were less responsive to PIF
   In parallel with the length of exposure to copper, oxidative damage was
   evident in coral tissues, as a decrease in the levels of tryptophan (up
   to 34\%) and coral fluorophores (16-88\%). This study shows that changes
   in fluorescent compounds can give an early indication of copper-induced
   damage in this coral before damage is outwardly visible. This is the
   first study to show that copper may alter algal responses to two host
   signalling compounds that regulate symbiotic algae. (C) 2003 Editions

Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {39},
Number = {2},
Pages = {419-431},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Elevated temperatures and nutrients are degrading coral reef ecosystems,
   but the understanding of how early life stages of reef corals respond to
   these stressors remains limited. Here, we test the impact of temperature
   (mean similar to 27 degrees C vs. similar to 29 degrees C) and nitrate
   and phosphate enrichment (ambient, + 5 mu M nitrate, + 1 mu M phosphate
   and combined + 5 mu M nitrate with 1 mu M phosphate) on coral larvae
   using three Hawaiian coral species with different modes of symbiont
   transmission and reproduction: Lobactis scutaria (horizontal, gonochoric
   broadcast spawner), Pocillopora acuta (vertical, hermaphroditic brooder)
   and Montipora capitata (vertical, hermaphroditic broadcast spawner).
   Temperature and nutrient effects were species specific and appear
   antagonistic for L. scutaria and M. capitata, but not for P. acuta.
   Larvae survivorship in all species was lowest under nitrate enrichment
   at 27 degrees C. M. capitata and L. scutaria survivorship increased at
   29 degrees C. However, positive effects of warming on survivorship were
   lost under high nitrate, but phosphate attenuated nitrate effects when
   N/P ratios were balanced. P. acuta larvae exhibited high survivorship (>
   91\%) in all treatments and showed little change in larval size, but
   lower respiration rates at 29 degrees C. Elevated nutrients (+N+P) led
   to the greatest loss in larvae size for aposymbiotic L. scutaria, while
   positive growth in symbiotic M. capitata larvae was reduced under
   warming and highest in +N+P treatments. Overall, we report a greater
   sensitivity of broadcast spawners to warming and nutrient changes
   compared to a brooding coral species. These results suggest variability
   in biological responses to warming and nutrient enrichment is influenced
   by life-history traits, including the presence of symbionts (vertical
   transmission), in addition to nutrient type and nutrient stoichiometry.},

Title = {Coral-macroalgal competition under ocean warming and acidification},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {534},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Competition between corals and macroalgae is frequently observed on
   reefs with the outcome of these interactions affecting the relative
   abundance of reef organisms and therefore reef health. Anthropogenic
   activities have resulted in increased atmospheric CO2 levels and a
   subsequent rise in ocean temperatures. In addition to increasing water
   temperature, elevated CO2 levels are leading to a decrease in oceanic pH
   (ocean acidification). These two changes have the potential to alter
   ecological processes within the oceans, including the outcome of
   competitive coral-macroalgal interactions. In our study, we explored the
   combined effect of temperature increase and ocean acidification on the
   competition between the coral Porites lobata and on the Great Barrier
   Reef abundant macroalga Chlorodesmis fastigiata. A temperature increase
   of +1 degrees C above present temperatures and CO2 increase of +85 ppm
   were used to simulate a low end emission scenario for the mid- to late
   21st century, according to the Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6
   (RCP2.6). Our results revealed that the net photosynthesis of P. lobata
   decreased when it was in contact with C. fastigiata under ambient
   conditions, and that dark respiration increased under RCP2.6 conditions.
   The Photosynthesis to Respiration (P:R) ratios of corals as they
   interacted with macroalgal competitors were not significantly different
   between scenarios. Dark calcification rates of corals under RCP2.6
   conditions, however, were negative and significantly decreased compared
   to ambient conditions. Light calcification rates were negatively
   affected by the interaction of macroalgal contact in the RCP2.6
   scenario, compared to algal mimics and to coral under ambient
   conditions. Chlorophyll a, and protein content increased in the RCP2.6
   scenario, but were not influenced by contact with the macroalga. We
   conclude that the coral host was negatively affected by RCP2.6
   conditions, whereas the productivity of its symbionts (zooxanthellae)
   was enhanced. While a negative effect of the macroalga (C. fastigiata)
   on the coral (P. lobata) was observed for the P:R ratio under control
   conditions, it was not enhanced under RCP2.6 conditions.},

Abstract = {The article aimed to assess the net ecosystem metabolism (NEM), and
   photosynthesis performance of Pocillopora acuta coral on the reef flat
   and reef slope of the southeast fringing reef of Phuket, Thailand, from
   June 2017 to January 2018, using 30 x 45-cm benthic oxygen flux chambers
   and a Junior Pulse Amplitude Modulated fluorometer. The results showed
   the NEM at both sites was significantly higher in the dry season. The
   effective quantum yield of P. acuta on the reef slope was significantly
   higher than that of the reef flat in both seasons. The maximum quantum
   yield showed seasonal variation, which was significantly higher on the
   reef slope during the dry season than that in the wet season. This study
   demonstrated temporal and spatial variations in ecosystem metabolism and
   photosynthetic activity due to different physical characteristics, such
   as light intensity, which is the main driver of coral reef ecosystem and
   different biological characteristics, such as the percentage of live
   coral, the number of microalgae and the symbiont density. The results
   provide a better understanding of how P. acuta responds to changes in
   depth and season and why corals on reef slopes might be more susceptible
   to bleaching than corals on reef flats.},

Title = {Contrasting Proteomic Responses of Adult and Larval Coral to High
   Temperatures},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 6},
Abstract = {Climate change-induced increases in seawater temperature continue to
   impact coral reef ecosystems globally. There is a consequent need to
   characterize the responses of corals to thermal stress to understand the
   molecular processes underpinning these responses and identify hallmarks
   of resilience. Here we used an iTRAQ approach to compare the proteomes
   of adult corals (Pocillopora acuta) that had been thermally conditioned
   at a control (26 degrees C) or elevated temperature (29.5 degrees C) for
   three reproductive cycles, as well as the larvae released by these
   corals. We found that larvae responded more to high-temperature exposure
   at the protein level than their parents and that different proteins were
   affected between life stages; a single protein was up-regulated at high
   temperatures in both adults and their offspring, and its identity is
   currently unknown. Similarly, different cellular pathways were affected
   by high-temperature exposure between the coral hosts and their
   dinoflagellate endosymbionts; proteins involved in translation and
   protein trafficking were most likely to be affected by high-temperature
   exposure in the former, with photosynthesis being the most
   thermo-sensitive process in the latter. Collectively, these findings
   highlight the importance of considering both life stage and the
   composition of the coral holobiont when using molecular-scale data to
   model cellular processes associated with responses to future ocean
   warming.</p>},

Title = {The impacts of ocean acidification, warming and their interactive
   effects on coral prokaryotic symbionts},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOME},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {BackgroundReef-building corals, the foundation of tropical coral reefs,
   are vulnerable to climate change e.g. ocean acidification and elevated
   seawater temperature. Coral microbiome plays a key role in host
   acclimatization and maintenance of the coral holobiont's homeostasis
   under different environmental conditions, however, the response patterns
   of coral prokaryotic symbionts to ocean acidification and/or warming are
   rarely known at the metatranscriptional level, particularly the
   knowledge of interactive and persistent effects is limited. Using
   branching Acropora valida and massive Galaxea fascicularis as models in
   a lab system simulating extreme ocean acidification (pH 7.7) and/or
   warming (32 degrees C) in the future, we investigated the changes of in
   situ active prokaryotic symbionts community and gene expression of
   corals under/after (6/9 d) acidification (A), warming (H) and
   acidification-warming (AH) by metatranscriptome analysis with pH8.1, 26
   degrees C as the control.ResultsA, H and AH increased the relative
   abundance of in situ active pathogenic bacteria. Differentially
   expressed genes (DEGs) involved in virulence, stress resistance, and
   heat shock proteins were up-regulated. Many DEGs involved in
   photosynthesis, carbon dioxide fixation, amino acids, cofactors and
   vitamins, auxin synthesis were down-regulated. A broad array of new DEGs
   involved in carbohydrate metabolism and energy production emerged after
   the stress treatment. Different response patterns of prokaryotic
   symbionts of massive G. fascicularis and branching A. valida were
   suggested, as well as the interactive effects of combined AH and
   persistent effects.ConclusionsThe metatranscriptome-based study
   indicates that acidification and/or warming might change coral's in situ
   active prokaryotic microbial diversity and functional gene expression
   towards more pathogenic and destabilized coral-microbes symbioses,
   particularly combined acidification and warming show interactive
   effects. These findings will aid in comprehension of the coral
   holobiont's ability for acclimatization under future climate change.},

Abstract = {The effects of elevated temperature and high pCO(2) on the metabolism of
   Galaxea fascicularis were studied with oxygen and pH microsensors.
   Photosynthesis and respiration rates were evaluated from the oxygen
   fluxes from and to the coral polyps. High-temperature alone lowered both
   photosynthetic and respiration rates. High pCO(2) alone did not
   significantly affect either photosynthesis or respiration rates. Under a
   combination of high-temperature and high-CO2, the photosynthetic rate
   increased to values close to those of the controls. The same pH in the
   diffusion boundary layer was observed under light in both (400 and 750
   ppm) CO2 treatments, but decreased significantly in the dark as a result
   of increased CO2. The ATP contents decreased with increasing
   temperature. The effects of temperature on the metabolism of corals were
   stronger than the effects of increased CO2. The effects of acidification
   were minimal without combined temperature stress. However, acidification
   combined with higher temperature may affect coral metabolism due to the
   amplification of diel variations in the microenvironment surrounding the
   coral and the decrease in ATP contents. (C) 2013 Academie des sciences.

Abstract = {Climate change causes ocean warming and acidification, which threaten
   coral reef ecosystems. Ocean warming and acidification cause bleaching
   and mortality, and decrease calcification in adult corals, leading to
   changes in the composition of coral communities; however. their
   interactive effects on coral larvae are not comprehensively understood.
   To examine the underlying molecular mechanisms of larval responses to
   elevated temperature and pCO(2), we examined the physiological
   performance and protein expression profiles of Pocillopora damicornis at
   two temperatures (29 and 33 degrees C) and pCO(2) levels (500 and 1000
   mu atm) for 5 d. Extensive physiological and proteomic changes were
   observed in coral larvae. The results indicated a significant decrease
   in net photosynthesis (P-NET) and autotrophic capability (P-NET/R-D) of
   larvae exposed to elevated temperature but a marked increase in P-NET
   and P-NET/R-D of larvae exposed to high pCO(2) levels. Elevated
   temperature significantly reduced endosymbiont densities by 70\% and
   photochemical efficiency, indicating that warming impaired host-symbiont
   symbiosis. Expression of photosynthesis-related proteins, the
   photosystem (PS) I reaction center subunits IV and XI as well as
   oxygen-evolving enhancer 1, was downregulated at higher temperatures in
   symbionts, whereas expression of the PS I iron-sulfur center protein was
   increased under high pCO(2) conditions. Furthermore, expression of
   phosphoribulokinase (involved in the Calvin cycle) and
   phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (related to the C-4 pathway) was
   downregulated in symbionts under thermal stress; this finding suggests
   reduced carbon fixation at high temperatures. The abundance of carbonic
   anhydrase-associated proteins, which are predicted to exert biochemical
   roles in dissolved inorganic carbon transport in larvae, was reduced in
   coral host and symbionts at high temperatures. These results elucidate
   potential mechanisms underlying the responses of coral larvae exposed to
   elevated temperature and acidification and suggest an important role of
   symbionts in the response to warming and acidification. (C) 2021

Abstract = {Two inhibitors of the Calvin-Benson cycle {[}glycolaldehyde (GA) and
   potassium cyanide (KCN)] were used in cultured Symbiodinium cells and in
   nubbins of the coral Pocillopora damicornis to test the hypothesis that
   inhibition of the Calvin-Benson cycle triggers coral bleaching.
   Inhibitor concentration range-finding trials aimed to determine the
   appropriate concentration to generate inhibition of the Calvin-Benson
   cycle, but avoid other metabolic impacts to the symbiont and the animal
   host. Both 3 mmol l(-1) GA and 20 mol l(-1) KCN caused minimal
   inhibition of host respiration, but did induce photosynthetic
   impairment, measured by a loss of photosystem II function and oxygen
   production. GA did not affect the severity of bleaching, nor induce
   bleaching in the absence of thermal stress, suggesting inhibition of the
   Calvin-Benson cycle by GA does not initiate bleaching in P. damicornis.
   In contrast, KCN did activate a bleaching response through symbiont
   expulsion, which occurred in the presence and absence of thermal stress.
   While KCN is an inhibitor of the Calvin-Benson cycle, it also promotes
   reactive oxygen species formation, and it is likely that this was the
   principal agent in the coral bleaching process. These findings do not
   support the hypothesis that temperature-induced inhibition of the
   Calvin-Benson cycle alone induces coral bleaching.},

Abstract = {The influence of temperature and inorganic carbon (C-i) concentration on
   photosynthesis was examined in whole corals and samples of cultured
   symbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium sp.) using combined measurements
   from a membrane inlet mass spectrometer and chl a fluorometer. In whole
   corals, O-2 production at 26 degrees C was significantly limited at C-i
   concentrations below ambient seawater (similar to 2.2 mM). Further
   additions of C-i up to similar to 10 mM caused no further stimulation of
   oxygenic photosynthesis. Following exposure to 30 degrees C (2 d), net
   oxygen production decreased significantly in whole corals, as a result
   of reduced production of photosynthetically derived oxygen rather than
   increased host consumption. Whole corals maintained a rate of oxygen
   evolution around eight times lower than cultured Symbiodinium sp. at
   inorganic carbon concentrations < 2 mM, but cultures displayed greater
   levels of photoinhibition following heat treatment (30 degrees C, 2 d).
   Whole corals and cultured zooxanthellae differed considerably in their
   responses to C-i concentration and moderate heat stress, demonstrating
   that cultured Symbiodinium make an incongruous model for those in
   hospite. Reduced net oxygen evolution, in whole corals, under conditions
   of low C-i (< 2 mM) has been interpreted in terms of possible sink
   limitation leading to increased nonphotochemical energy dissipation. The
   advantages of combined measurement of net gas exchange and fluorometry
   offered by this method are discussed.},

Title = {Effects of cyanide on coral photosynthesis: implications for identifying
   the cause of coral bleaching and for assessing the environmental effects
   of cyanide fishing},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {177},
Pages = {83-91},
Abstract = {Modulated chlorophyll fluorescence techniques were used to examine the
   effects of cyanide (NaCN) from cyanide fishing on photosynthesis of the
   symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) located within the tissues of the
   zooxanthellate hard coral Plesiastrea versipora. Incubating corals for 3
   h in a cyanide concentration of >10(-5) M NaCN under a saturating light
   intensity (photosynthetically active radiation {[}PAR] intensity of 250
   mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)) caused a long-term decrease in the ratio of
   variable to maximal fluorescence (dark-adapted F-v/F-m). The effect of
   cyanide on dark-adapted F-v/F-m was Light dependent; thus F-v/F-m only
   decreased in corals exposed to 10(-4) M NaCN for 3 h under PAR of 250 mu
   mol quanta m(-2) s(-1). In corals where dark-adapted F-v/F-m was
   significantly lowered by cyanide exposure, we observed significant loss
   of zooxanthellae from the tissues. causing the corals to discolour
   (bleach). To further examine the light-dependent effect of cyanide and
   its relation to loss of zooxanthellae, corals were exposed to 10-4 M
   NaCN or seawater only (control), either in darkness or under 250 mu mol
   quanta m(-2) s(-1). ill significant decrease in dark-adapted F-v/F-m and
   loss of zooxanthellae only occurred in corals exposed to cyanide in the
   light. These results suggest cyanide causes the dissociation of the
   symbiosis (bleaching) by affecting photosynthesis of the zooxanthellae.
   Quenching analysis using the saturation-pulse technique revealed the
   development of high levels of non-photochemical quenching in
   cyanide-exposed coral. This result is consistent with the known property
   of cyanide as an inhibitor of the dark reactions of the Calvin cycle,
   specifically as an inhibitor of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
   carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). Therefore, chronic photoinhibition and
   an impairment of photosynthesis of zooxanthellae provides an important
   `signal' to examine the environmental effects of cyanide fishing during
   controlled releases in situ.},

Abstract = {Species have evolved different mechanisms to cope with spatial and
   temporal temperature variability. Species with broad geographical
   distributions may be thermal generalists that perform well across a
   broad range of temperatures, or they might contain subpopulations of
   locally adapted thermal specialists. We quantified the variation in
   thermal performance of two coral species, Porites cylindrica and
   Acropora spp., along a latitudinal gradient over which temperature
   varies by approximately 68 degrees C. Photosynthesis rates, respiration
   rates, maximum quantum yield and maximum electron transport rates were
   measured on coral fragments exposed to an acute temperature increase and
   decrease up to 58 degrees C above and below the local average
   temperature. Results showed geographical variation in the performance
   curves of both species at holobiont and symbiont level, but this did not
   lead to an alignment of the optimal temperature for performance with the
   average temperature of the local environment, suggesting suboptimal
   coral performance of these coral populations in summer. Furthermore,
   symbiont thermal performance generally had an optimum closer to the
   average environmental temperature than holobiont performance, suggesting
   that symbionts have a higher capacity for acclimatization than the coral
   host, and can aid the coral host when temperatures are unfavourable.

Abstract = {Coastal oceans are increasingly eutrophic, warm and acidic through the
   addition of anthropogenic nitrogen and carbon, respectively. Among the
   most sensitive taxa to these changes are scleractinian corals, which
   engineer the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth. Corals' sensitivity is
   a consequence of their evolutionary investment in symbiosis with the
   dinoflagellate alga, Symbiodinium. Together, the coral holobiont has
   dominated oligotrophic tropical marine habitats. However, warming
   destabilizes this association and reduces coral fitness. It has been
   theorized that, when reefs become warm and eutrophic, mutualistic
   Symbiodinium sequester more resources for their own growth, thus
   parasitizing their hosts of nutrition. Here, we tested the hypothesis
   that sub- bleaching temperature and excess nitrogen promotes symbiont
   parasitism by measuring respiration (costs) and the assimilation and
   translocation of both carbon (energy) and nitrogen (growth; both
   benefits) within Orbicella faveolata hosting one of two Symbiodinium
   phylotypes using a dual stable isotope tracer incubation at ambient (26
   degrees C) and sub- bleaching (31 degrees C) temperatures under elevated
   nitrate. Warming to 31 degrees C reduced holobiont net primary
   productivity (NPP) by 60\% due to increased respiration which decreased
   host \% carbon by 15\% with no apparent cost to the symbiont.
   Concurrently, Symbiodinium carbon and nitrogen assimilation increased by
   14 and 32\%, respectively while increasing their mitotic index by 15\%,
   whereas hosts did not gain a proportional increase in translocated
   photosynthates. We conclude that the disparity in benefits and costs to
   both partners is evidence of symbiont parasitism in the coral symbiosis
   and has major implications for the resilience of coral reefs under
   threat of global change.},

Title = {Sub-lethal coral stress: Detecting molecular responses of coral
   populations to environmental conditions over space and time},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {128},
Pages = {135-146},

Abstract = {In order for sessile organisms to survive environmental fluctuations and
   exposures to pollutants, molecular mechanisms (i.e. stress responses)
   are elicited. Previously, detrimental effects of natural and
   anthropogenic stressors on coral health could not be ascertained until
   significant physiological responses resulted in visible signs of stress
   (e.g. tissue necrosis, bleaching). In this study, a focused. anthozoan
   holobiont microarray was used to detect early and sub-lethal effects of
   spatial and temporal environmental changes on gene expression patterns
   in the scleractinian coral, Montastraea cavernosa, on south Florida
   reefs. Although all colonies appeared healthy (i.e. no visible tissue
   necrosis or bleaching), corals were differentially physiologically
   compensating for exposure to stressors that varied over time. Corals
   near the Port of Miami inlet experienced significant changes in
   expression of stress responsive and symbiont (zooxanthella)-specific
   genes after periods of heavy precipitation. In contrast, coral
   populations did not demonstrate stress responses during periods of
   increased water temperature (up to 29 degrees C). Specific acute and
   long-term localized responses to other stressors were also evident. A
   correlation between stress response genes and symbiont-specific genes
   was also observed, possibly indicating early processes involved in the
   maintenance or disruption of the coral zooxanthella symbiosis. This is
   the first study to reveal spatially- and temporally-related variation in
   gene expression in response to different stressors of in situ coral
   populations, and demonstrates that microarray technology can be used to
   detect specific sub-lethal physiological responses to specific
   environmental conditions that are not visually detectable. (c) 2012

Title = {Mitochondrial terminal alternative oxidase and its enhancement by
   thermal stress in the coral symbiont <i>Symbiodinium</i>},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {543-552},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A terminal electron acceptor alternative to mitochondrial cytochrome c
   oxidase (COX), mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX), is ubiquitous in
   higher plants and represented in nearly every algal taxon but is poorly
   documented in dinoflagellates. AOX competes for electrons with the
   conventional COX and has been hypothesized to function as a means of
   reducing oxidative stress in mitochondria, as well as a potential
   mechanism for ameliorating thermal and other physiological stressors.
   Here, the presence of an active AOX in cultured Symbiodinium was assayed
   by the response of oxygen consumption to the AOX inhibitor
   salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) and the COX inhibitor cyanide (CN).
   CN-insensitive, SHAM-sensitive oxygen consumption was found to account
   for a large portion (26 \%) of Symbiodinium dark respiration and is
   consistent with high levels of AOX activity. This experimental evidence
   of the existence of a previously unreported terminal oxidase was further
   corroborated by analysis of publicly available Symbiodinium
   transcriptome data. The potential for enhanced AOX expression to play a
   compensatory role in mediating thermal stress was supported by inhibitor
   assays of cultured Symbiodinium at low (18 A degrees C), moderate (26 A
   degrees C), and high (32 A degrees C) temperature conditions. Maximum
   capacity of the putative AOX pathway as a proportion of total dark
   oxygen consumption was found to increase from 26 \% at 26 A degrees C to
   45 \% and 53 \% at 18 A degrees C and 32 A degrees C, respectively, when
   cells were acclimated to the treatment temperatures. Cells assayed at 18
   and 32 A degrees C without acclimation exhibited either the same or
   lower AOX capacity as controls, suggesting that the AOX protein is
   upregulated under temperature stress. The physiological implications for
   the presence of AOX in the coral/algal symbiosis and its potential role
   in response to many forms of biotic and abiotic stress, particularly
   oxidative stress, are discussed.},

Title = {A simple role of coral-algal symbiosis in coral calcification based on
   multiple geochemical tracers},
Journal = {GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {235},
Pages = {76-88},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Light-enhanced calcification of reef-building corals, which eventually
   create vast coral reefs, is well known and based on coral-algal
   symbiosis. Several controversial hypotheses have been proposed as
   possible mechanisms for connecting symbiont photosynthesis and coral
   calcification, including pH rise in the internal pool, role of organic
   matrix secretion, and enzyme activities. Here, based on the skeletal
   chemical and isotopic compositions of symbiotic and asymbiotic primary
   polyps of Acropora digitifera corals, we show a simple pH increase in
   the calcification medium as the predominant contribution of symbionts to
   calcification of host corals. We used the symbiotic and asymbiotic
   primary polyps reared for 10 days at four temperatures (27, 29, 31, and
   33 degrees C), five salinities (34, 32, 30, 28, and 26), and four pCO(2)
   levels (<300, 400, 800, and 1000)(atm). As a result of analyzing
   multiple geochemical tracers (U/Ca, Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, delta O-18, delta
   C-13, and 8 44 Ca), a clear and systematic decrease in skeletal U/Ca
   ratio (used as a proxy for calcification fluid pH) was observed,
   indicating a higher pH of the fluid in symbiotic compared to asymbiotic
   polyps. In contrast, Mg/Ca ratios (used as a tentative proxy for organic
   matrix secretion) and 8 44 Ca (used as an indicator of Ca2+ pathway to
   the fluid) did not differ between symbiotic and asymbiotic polyps. This
   suggests that organic matrix secretion related to coral calcification is
   controlled mainly by the coral host itself, and a transmembrane
   transport of Ca2+ does not vary according to symbiosis relationship.
   Skeletal delta O-18 values of both symbiotic and asymbiotic polyps
   showed offsets between them with identical temperature dependence. Based
   on a newly proposed model, behavior of delta O-18 in the present study
   seems to reflect the rate of CO2 hydration in the calcifying fluid.
   Since CO2 hydration is promoted by enzyme carbonic anhydrase, the offset
   of delta O-18 values between symbiotic and asymbiotic polyps is
   attributed to the differences of enzyme activity, although the enzyme is
   functional even in the asymbiotic polyp. Symbiotic delta C-13 values in
   the temperature and salinity experiments were higher compared to those
   in the asymbiotic polyps due to photosynthesis, although photosynthetic
   delta C-13 signals in the pCO(2) experiment were masked by the dominant
   delta C-13 gradient in dissolved inorganic carbon in seawater caused by
   C-13-depletd CO2 gas addition in the higher pCO(2) treatments. Sr/Ca
   ratios showed a negligible relationship according to variation of
   temperature, salinity, and pCO(2), although it might be attributed to
   relatively large deviations of replicates of Sr/Ca ratios in the present
   study. Overall, only the U/Ca ratio showed a significant difference
   between symbiotic and asymbiotic polyps throughout all experiments,
   indicating that the critical effect on coral calcification caused by
   symbiotic algae is the increase of pH of the calcifying fluid by
   photosynthesis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Loss of zooxanthellae in a coral under high seawater temperature and
   nutrient enrichment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {457},
Pages = {220-225},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {To investigate the effect of nutrient concentrations on coral-algal
   symbiosis under thermal stress, the abundance and release of
   zooxanthellae in the coral Acropora tenuis were quantified under
   laboratory conditions. The coral fragments were first cultured in either
   low-nutrient (LN) or high-nutrient (HN) seawater condition at 27 degrees
   C for 25 days and the seawater temperature was then elevated and kept at
   31 degrees C for 1 week for both nutrient conditions. Nutrient
   enrichment at 27 degrees C increased the densities of symbiotic algae
   and chlorophyll a and the algal release rates (AR) from the host coral
   to the ambient seawater. The percentage of algal release rate to the
   standing stock (AR\%) was approximately 0.015\%h(-1) for both nutrient
   conditions at 27 degrees C. After the seawater temperature was elevated
   to 31 degrees C, the densities of zooxanthellae in the corals decreased
   by 21-61\%, and AR and AR\% increased. The corals in HN lost more
   zooxanthellae per unit surface area than those in LN, but the lost
   percentages were not significantly different between LN and HN. AR\% was
   also not significantly different between LN and HN at 31 degrees C.
   These results indicated that the percentage rate of symbiotic algal loss
   was not affected by the nutrient condition, implying that nutrient
   incorporation itself would not accelerate coral bleaching
   susceptibility. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Thermal performance curves describe the relationship between temperature
   and the rate of biological processes. These relationships can vary among
   species and environments, allowing organisms to acclimatize to their
   local thermal regime. This study quantified the seasonal variation in
   the thermal performance of several coral and symbiont-dominated
   physiological traits for the thermally tolerant coral species Porites
   cylindrica and the thermally sensitive coral species Acropora
   valenciennesi. Photosynthesis rates, respiration rates, maximum
   photosystem II (PSII) quantum yield and electron transport rates were
   measured in winter and summer on coral fragments exposed to an acute
   temperature increase and decrease up to 5 degrees C above and below the
   average seawater temperature in each season. Results showed that
   colonies of A. valenciennesi acclimated primarily by shifting their
   optimal temperature to a higher temperature in summer, whereas colonies
   of P. cylindrica had broader thermal breadth during summer. For
   symbionts within both species, performance was higher at all
   temperatures in summer, while the thermal optima and performance breadth
   remained unchanged. Despite these changes in thermal performance, the
   thermal optima of most traits did not match the ambient environmental
   temperature, but fell between the summer and winter temperatures.
   Overall, these results showed that both coral species were
   physiologically plastic in response to temperature change, but that
   there are constraints on the rate or capacity for acclimation that
   prevent a perfect match between the average temperature of the
   environment and the thermal optimum of the species.},

Title = {Impacts of elevated temperature and <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> on the

Abstract = {In this study, we tested whether larvae brooded by the reef coral
   Pocillopora damicornis from a naturally extreme and highly variable
   environment are preadapted to cope with predicted increases in
   temperature and pCO(2). We exposed larvae to two temperatures (29 vs.
   30.8 degrees C) crossed with two pCO(2) levels (similar to 500 vs.
   similar to 1000 mu atm) in a full-factorial experiment for 5 d. Larval
   performance was assessed as dark respiration (R-D), net and gross
   photosynthesis (P-N and P-G, respectively), survival, settlement, and
   the activity of carbonic anhydrase (CA), the central enzyme involved in
   photosynthesis. The results showed that R-D was unaffected by either
   elevated temperature or pCO(2), while elevated temperature and/or pCO(2)
   stimulated P-N and P-G and increased the ratios of P-N to R-D,
   indicating a relatively higher autotrophic capacity. Consequently,
   larval survivorship under elevated temperature and/or pCO(2) was
   consistently 14\% higher than that under the control treatment.
   Furthermore, elevated temperature and pCO(2) did not affect host CA
   activity, but synergistically enhanced symbiont CA activity,
   contributing greatly to the stimulated photosynthetic capacity. These
   results suggest that brooded larvae of P. damicornis larvae from
   Luhuitou may be preadapted to cope with projected warming and ocean
   acidification. More generally, it appears that corals from highly
   variable environments may have increased resilience to the widespread
   climate change.},

Title = {Heating rate modulates the metabolic response of the staghorn coral
   <i>Acropora cervicornis</i> (Lamarck, 1816)},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {168},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Corals are relatively stenothermic organisms and highly sensitive to
   thermal stress. To understand how heating rate modulates the holobiont
   response to thermal challenge, we compared the effects of acute heat
   shock and cumulative thermal exposures on Acropora cervicornis from
   Southeast Florida (26 degrees 06 N, 80 degrees 05 W). In March of 2017,
   maximum dark-adapted yield of photosystem II (F-V/F-M), rates of dark
   respiration (R), and rates of gross photosynthesis (P-g) were measured
   at temperatures spanning 25-36 degrees C. Thermal performance curves of
   each response variable were constructed as a function of temperature and
   thermal dose (i.e., degree heating minutes). Acute exposure (i.e.,
   instantaneously increasing temperature by between 2.5 and 10 degrees C)
   resulted in a more marked decline in physiology despite a lower thermal
   dose, compared to the cumulative exposure (2.5 degrees C h(-1)).
   Apparent deficits in coral holobiont metabolism were observed as a
   function of both temperature and thermal dose, but examination of
   holobiont metabolism in a dose-context revealed more pronounced
   differences between acute and cumulative exposures. Subtle physiological
   differences may be more easily identified and better cross-study
   comparisons of cnidarian thermal tolerance may be achieved by placing
   temperature exposures in degree heating times. In addition, the ratio of
   daily P-g:R fell below 1 when temperatures exceeded 32 degrees C,
   corroborating prior observations that P-g:R may be a means of
   identifying physiological deficits in advance of visual signs of
   dysbiosis, such as bleaching.},

Title = {Nutrient and sediment loading affect multiple facets of functionality in
   a tropical branching coral},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {223},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Coral reefs, one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world, face
   increasing pressures from global and local anthropogenic stressors.
   Therefore, a better understanding of the ecological ramifications of
   warming and land-based inputs (e.g. sedimentation and nutrient loading)
   on coral reef ecosystems is necessary. In this study, we measured how a
   natural nutrient and sedimentation gradient affected multiple facets of
   coral functionality, including endosymbiont and coral host response
   variables, holobiont metabolic responses and percent cover of
   Pocillopora acuta colonies in Mo'orea, French Polynesia. We used thermal
   performance curves to quantify the relationship between metabolic rates
   and temperature along the environmental gradient. We found that algal
   endosymbiont percent nitrogen content, endosymbiont densities and total
   chlorophyll a content increased with nutrient input, while endosymbiont
   nitrogen content per cell decreased, likely representing competition
   among the algal endosymbionts. Nutrient and sediment loading decreased
   coral metabolic responses to thermal stress in terms of their thermal
   performance and metabolic rate processes. The acute thermal optimum for
   dark respiration decreased, along with the maximal performance for gross
   photosynthetic and calcification rates. Gross photosynthetic and
   calcification rates normalized to a reference temperature (26.8 degrees
   C) decreased along the gradient. Lastly, percent cover of P. acuta
   colonies decreased by nearly two orders of magnitude along the nutrient
   gradient. These findings illustrate that nutrient and sediment loading
   affect multiple levels of coral functionality. Understanding how
   local-scale anthropogenic stressors influence the responses of corals to
   temperature can inform coral reef management, particularly in relation
   to the mediation of land-based inputs into coastal coral reef
   ecosystems.},

Year = {2005},
Volume = {208},
Number = {5},
Pages = {843-848},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This study evaluates in vitro the effects of UVB irradiation on three
   cellular compartments of a shallow water coral species. Coral tissues
   were dissociated by Ca2+-Mg2+-free artificial seawater. Cell suspensions
   were divided into the major cellular compartments (animal cells, algal
   cells, holobiont entities) by sucrose gradient and then by detergent
   treatments. Cell fractions were irradiated by UVB lamp (4.05, 8.1 and
   12.2 kJ m(-2)) and subjected to the comet assay. UVB radiation, at
   levels that induced a moderate DNA breakage to the non-symbiotic coral
   and algal cell compartments, caused dramatic increase in DNA breakage to
   the holobiont entities. After a 1 h repair period, DNA breakage levels
   in the algal and animal cell fractions were augmented as compared with a
   reduction in DNA breakage in the holobiont fraction. This discordancy in
   DNA breakage between the three cellular compartments reveals that the
   holobiont cell fraction is more vulnerable to increased natural UV
   irradiation and associated anthropogenic genotoxic impacts, providing
   another possible explanation for recent increase in worldwide coral
   bleaching events.},

Title = {Spectral Reflectance of Palauan Reef-Building Coral with Different
   Symbionts in Response to Elevated Temperature},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Spectral reflectance patterns of corals are driven largely by the
   pigments of photosynthetic symbionts within the host cnidarian. The warm
   inshore bays and cooler offshore reefs of Palau share a variety of coral
   species with differing endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (genus:
   Symbiodinium), with the thermally tolerant Symbiodinium trenchii (S.
   trenchii) (= type D1a or D1-4) predominating under the elevated
   temperature regimes inshore, and primarily Clade C types in the cooler
   reefs offshore. Spectral reflectance of two species of stony coral,
   Cyphastrea serailia (C. serailia) and Pachyseris rugosa (P. rugosa),
   from both inshore and offshore locations shared multiple features both
   between sites and to similar global data from other studies. No clear
   reflectance features were evident which might serve as markers of
   thermally tolerant S. trenchii symbionts compared to the same species of
   coral with different symbionts. Reflectance from C. serailia colonies
   from inshore had a fluorescence peak at approximately 500 nm which was
   absent from offshore animals. Integrated reflectance across visible
   wavelengths had an inverse correlation to symbiont cell density and
   could be used as a relative indicator of the symbiont abundance for each
   type of coral. As hypothesized, coral colonies from offshore with Clade
   C symbionts showed a greater response to experimental heating,
   manifested as decreased symbiont density and increased reflectance or
   ``bleaching{''} than their inshore counterparts with S. trenchii.
   Although no unique spectral features were found to distinguish species
   of symbiont, spectral differences related to the abundance of symbionts
   could prove useful in field and remote sensing studies.},

Title = {Bacteria appear to play important roles in both causing and preventing
   the bleaching of the coral <i>Oculina patagonica</i>},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {489},
Pages = {155-162},
Abstract = {Vibrio shiloi was reported in 1996 to be the causative agent of
   bleaching of the coral Oculina patagonica in the eastern Mediterranean
   Sea, and the mechanisms of infection and bleaching were studied
   intensively from 1996 to 2002. Sometime between 2002 and 2004, O.
   patagonica became resistant to V. shiloi yet continued to bleach
   seasonally. These findings raised 2 questions: (1) What is the current
   cause of the bleaching? (2) How did the coral become resistant to the
   pathogen V. shiloi? Data presented here indicate that a bacterium, or
   bacteria, other than V. shiloi is currently responsible for the
   bleaching, because the antibiotic nalidixic acid inhibited heat-induced
   bleaching in aquaria. Raising the temperature of O. patagonica in
   aquaria to 31 C caused 24 of 28 coral fragments to bleach. When the O.
   patagonica was exposed to the same temperature increase but treated with
   nalidixic acid for 24 h when the temperature reached 28 degrees C, only
   10 of 34 fragments bleached. Antibiotic-treated corals had 5.3-fold more
   zooxanthellae at the end of the heating experiment than the
   no-antibiotic control, supporting the visual bleaching observations. V.
   coralliilyticus strain EM1 is a candidate bleaching pathogen because it
   was isolated from bleached corals, caused bleaching in 5 of 6
   antibiotic-treated corals and could be recovered from the experimentally
   bleached corals. In support of the coral probiotic hypothesis, anti
   biotictreated corals became sensitive to V. shiloi infection and
   bleaching (10 of 12 fragments), presumably by killing beneficial
   bacteria that inhibited V. shiloi growth. Bacterial strain EM3, isolated
   from O. patagonica fragments, may play a role in preventing V. shiloi
   infection of corals because it releases a diffusible material that
   specifically inhibited the growth of V. shiloi in vitro.},

Abstract = {Lophelia pertusa is the world's most common and widespread
   framework-forming cold-water coral. It forms deep-water coral reefs and
   carbonate mounds supporting diverse animal communities on the
   continental shelf and on seamounts. These recently discovered ecosystems
   have been damaged by deep-sea fishing and are threatened by predicted
   shallowing of the aragonite saturation horizon. Despite this, very
   little is known about the ecophysiology of L. pertusa and its likely
   response to environmental changes. Here we describe the first study of
   the respiratory physiology of L. pertusa and the effects of altered
   temperature and oxygen level. This study shows that L. pertusa can
   maintain respiratory independence over a range Of PO2 illustrated by a
   high regulation value (R=78\%). The critical PO2 value of 9-10 kPa is
   very similar to the lower values of oxygen concentration recorded in the
   field. This suggests that oxygen level may be a limiting factor in the
   distribution of this cold-water coral. L. pertusa survived periods of
   anoxia (I h), hypoxia (up to 96 h), but high Q(10) values revealed
   sensitivity to short-term temperature changes (6.5-11 degrees C. For the
   first time vital data have been gathered on the physiology of this
   species that is essential to understand distribution and underpin future
   climate change studies. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to test whether elevated pCO(2)
   predicted for the year 2100 (85.1 Pa) affects bleaching in the coral
   Seriatopora caliendrum (Ehrenberg 1834) either independently or
   interactively with high temperature (30.5 A degrees C). Response
   variables detected the sequence of events associated with the onset of
   bleaching: reduction in the photosynthetic performance of symbionts as
   measured by maximum photochemical efficiency (F (v)/F (m)) and effective
   photochemical efficiency (Delta F/F (m)') of PSII, declines in net
   photosynthesis (P (net)) and photosynthetic efficiency (alpha, alpha),
   and finally, reduced chlorophyll a and symbiont concentrations. S.
   caliendrum was collected from Nanwan Bay, Taiwan, and subjected to
   combinations of temperature (27.7 vs. 30.5 A degrees C) and pCO(2) (45.1
   vs. 85.1 Pa) for 14 days. High temperature reduced values of all
   dependent variables (i.e., bleaching occurred), but high pCO(2) did not
   affect Symbiodinium photophysiology or productivity, and did not cause
   bleaching. These results suggest that short-term exposure to 81.5 Pa
   pCO(2), alone and in combination with elevated temperature, does not
   cause or affect coral bleaching.},

Title = {The effect of temperature compensation on the circadian rhythmicity of
   photosynthesis in <i>Symbiodinium</i>, coral-symbiotic alga},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {2},
Month = {JUL 26},
Abstract = {Circadian rhythms, which are found in most eukaryotes, are defined as
   rhythms that persist under constant conditions with a periodicity close
   to 24 h. One central key characteristic of all circadian rhythms is
   ``temperature compensation{''}, which allows organisms to maintain
   robust rhythms with a period close to a diel cycle over a broad range of
   physiological temperatures. To better understand the response of the
   circadian clock in corals to temperature elevation, photosynthesis as an
   output process of the circadian clock was studied both in Stylophora
   pistillata corals and in cultured Symbiodinium algae. The time period of
   photosynthesis was not affected by temperature elevation in the cultured
   algae or in the corals harbouring Symbiodinium. However, the
   photosynthetic system responded to temperature elevations by adjusting
   the photosynthetic apparatus. These findings suggest that the endogenous
   algal circadian clock regulates the photosynthetic rhythm and
   compensates for temperature elevations that occur in the natural
   environment.},

Abstract = {Reef-building corals inhabit a variety of aquatic habitats with a range
   of light conditions. Because the coral host depends on photosynthetic
   products assimilated from endosymbiotic algae, reef-building corals have
   to cope with irradiance fluctuations on instantaneous to seasonal time
   scales. Underwater high-frequency light fluctuations resulting from the
   lens effect on the water surface are prominent in oligotrophic coral
   reef environments, a phenomenon known as flicker light. Effects of
   flicker light on endosymbiont photosynthesis of the reef-building coral
   Acropora digitifera (Dana, 1846) were evaluated with pulse amplitude
   modulation chlorophyll fluorometry. At supersaturating light
   intensities, photosynthesis was less inhibited by flicker light than by
   constant light. Reduction in photoinhibition by flicker light was
   pronounced at high water temperatures. Flicker light may strongly
   influence endosymbiont photosynthesis of corals inhabiting shallow reef
   habitats, especially during periods of strong solar irradiance and high
   water temperature.},

Abstract = {Reef-building corals respond to the temporal integration of both pulse
   events (i.e., heat waves) and press thermal history (i.e., local
   environment) via physiological changes, with ecological consequences. We
   used a ``press-pulse-press{''} experimental framework to expose the
   brooding coral Porites astreoides to various thermal histories to
   understand the physiological response of temporal dynamics within and
   across generations. We collected adult colonies from two reefs (outer
   Rim reef and inner Patch reef) in Bermuda with naturally contrasting
   thermal regimes as our initial ``press{''} scenario, followed by a
   21-day ex situ ``pulse{''} thermal stress of 30.4 degrees C during
   larval brooding, and a ``press{''} year-long adult reciprocal transplant
   between the original sites. Higher endosymbiont density and holobiont
   protein was found in corals originating from the lower thermal
   variability site (Rim) compared to the higher thermal variability site
   (Patch). The thermal pulse event drove significant declines in
   photosynthesis, endosymbiont density, and chlorophyll a, with bleaching
   phenotype convergence for adults from both histories. Following the
   reciprocal transplant, photosynthesis was higher in previously heated
   corals, indicating recovery from the thermal pulse. The effect of origin
   (initial press) modulated the response to transplant site for
   endosymbiont density and chlorophyll a, suggesting contrasting
   acclimation strategies. Higher respiration and photosynthetic rates were
   found in corals originating from the Rim site, indicating greater energy
   available for reproduction, supported by larger larvae released from Rim
   corals post-transplantation. Notably, parental exposure to the pulse
   thermal event resulted in increased offspring plasticity when parents
   were transplanted to foreign sites, highlighting the legacy of the pulse
   event and the importance of the environment during recovery in
   contributing to cross-generational or developmental plasticity.
   Together, these findings provide novel insight into the role of
   historical disturbance events in driving differential outcomes within
   and across generations, which is of critical importance in forecasting
   reef futures.},

Title = {Individual and combined effect of organic eutrophication (DOC) and ocean
   warming on the ecophysiology of the Octocoral <i>Pinnigorgia flava</i>},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {FEB 17},
Abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) enrichment and ocean warming both
   negatively affect hard corals, but studies on their combined effects on
   other reef organisms are scarce. Octocorals are likely to become key
   players in future reef communities, but they are still highly
   under-investigated with regard to their responses to global and local
   environmental changes. Thus, we evaluated the individual and combined
   effects of DOC enrichment (10, 20 and 40 mg L(-)1 DOC, added as glucose)
   and warming (stepwise from 26 to 32 degrees C) on the widespread
   Indo-Pacific gorgonian Pinnigorgia flava in a 45-day laboratory
   experiment. Oxygen fluxes (net photosynthesis and respiration), as well
   as Symbiodiniaceae cell density and coral growth were assessed. Our
   results highlight a differential ecophysiological response to DOC
   enrichment and warming as well as their combination. Individual DOC
   addition did not significantly affect oxygen fluxes nor Symbiodiniaceae
   cell density and growth, while warming significantly decreased
   photosynthesis rates and Symbiodiniaceae cell density. When DOC
   enrichment and warming were combined, no effect on P. flava oxygen
   fluxes was observed while growth responded to certain DOC conditions
   depending on the temperature. Our findings indicate that P. flava is
   insensitive to the individual effect of DOC enrichment, but not to
   warming and the two stressors combined. This suggests that, if
   temperature remains below certain thresholds, this gorgonian species may
   gain a competitive advantage over coral species that are reportedly more
   affected by DOC eutrophication. However, under the expected increasing
   temperature scenarios, it is also likely that this octocoral species
   will be negatively affected, with potential consequences on community
   structure. This study contributes to our understanding of the conditions
   that drive phase shift dynamics in coastal coral reef ecosystemds.},

Title = {Warm seawater temperature promotes substrate colonization by the blue
   coral, <i>Heliopora coerulea</i>},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 27},
Abstract = {Background: Heliopora coerulea, the blue coral, is a reef building
   octocoral that is reported to have a higher optimum temperature for
   growth compared to most scleractinian corals. This octocoral has been
   observed to grow over both live and dead scleractinians and to dominate
   certain reefs in the Indo-Pacific region. The molecular mechanisms
   underlying the ability of H. coerulea to tolerate warmer seawater
   temperatures and to effectively compete for space on the substrate
   remain to be elucidated.
   Methods: In this study, we subjected H. coerulea colonies to various
   temperatures for up to 3 weeks. The growth and photosynthetic efficiency
   rates of the coral colonies were measured. We then conducted pairwise
   comparisons of gene expression among the different coral tissue regions
   to identify genes and pathways that are expressed under different
   temperature conditions.
   Results: A horizontal growth rate of 1.13 +/- 0.25 mm per week was
   observed for corals subjected to 28 or 31 degrees C. This growth rate
   was significantly higher compared to corals exposed at 26 degrees C.
   This new growth was characterized by the extension of whitish tissue at
   the edges of the colony and was enriched for a matrix metallopeptidase,
   a calcium and integrin binding protein, and other transcripts with
   unknown function. Tissues at the growth margin and the adjacent
   calcified encrusting region were enriched for transcripts related to
   proline and riboflavin metabolism, nitrogen utilization, and organic
   cation transport. The calcified digitate regions, on the other hand,
   were enriched for transcripts encoding proteins involved in cell-matrix
   adhesion, translation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, photosynthesis,
   and ion transport. Functions related to lipid biosynthesis,
   extracellular matrix formation, cell migration, and oxidation-reduction
   processes were enriched at the growth margin in corals subjected for 3
   weeks to 28 or 31 degrees C relative to corals at 26 degrees C. In the
   digitate region of the coral, transcripts encoding proteins that protect
   against oxidative stress, modify cell membrane composition, and mediate
   intercellular signaling pathways were enriched after just 24 h of
   exposure to 31 degrees C compared to corals at 28 degrees C. The overall
   downregulation of gene expression observed after 3 weeks of sustained
   exposure to 31 degrees C is likely compensated by symbiont metabolism.
   Discussion: These findings reveal that the different regions of H.
   coerulea have variable gene expression profiles and responses to
   temperature variation. Under warmer conditions, the blue coral invests
   cellular resources toward extracellular matrix formation and cellular
   migration at the colony margins, which may promote rapid tissue growth
   and extension. This mechanism enables the coral to colonize adjacent
   reef substrates and successfully overgrow slower growing scleractinian
   corals that may already be more vulnerable to warming ocean waters.},

Title = {Symbiont composition and coral genotype determines massive coral species
   performance under end-of-century climate scenarios},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {The recent decline of coral health and substantial loss of coral cover
   along Florida's Coral Reef (FCR) results from local stressors such as
   degraded water quality and disease outbreaks in addition to
   anthropogenically driven global stressors including ocean warming and
   acidification. Intervention strategies intended for the restoration of
   degraded reef habitats need a better understanding of the influence of
   ocean warming and acidification on coral health to target coral species
   and individual genotypes that may be more resistant or resilient to such
   stressors. Here, we examined a suite of physiological traits (coral host
   and algal symbiont) in response to experimentally elevated water
   temperatures and pCO(2) levels, both separately and in concert, using
   threatened reef-building corals Pseudodiploria clivosa and Orbicella
   faveolata reared within a land-based coral nursery. After two months of
   exposure, responses differed by coral species, where P. clivosa showed
   declined physiology in response to combined ocean warming and
   acidification stress and ocean warming alone, whereas O. faveolata
   showed a positive response under ocean acidification. Responses to
   temperature could be associated with the algal symbionts harbored, as P.
   clivosa was dominated by the thermally sensitive Breviolum, and O.
   faveolata was dominated by the thermally tolerant Durusdinium.
   Additionally, corals were raised in well-sourced seawater that was
   naturally high in pCO(2), which could have led to corals acclimating to
   acidified conditions. Of the three P. clivosa genets tested, we
   determined a top-performing genotype under the combined warming and
   acidification treatment. O. faveolata, however, displayed high genet
   variation by treatment and phenotypic trait, making genotype performance
   rankings challenging to discern. The evidence provided in this study
   demonstrates that high phenotypic variation in nursery-reared corals
   contributes to variable warming-acidification responses, suggesting that
   high-standing genetic variation in nursery-reared corals could support
   diverse coral restoration population outcomes along FCR.},

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {272},
Pages = {117-130},
Abstract = {Rising sea temperatures are increasing the incidences of mass coral
   bleaching (the dissociation of the coral-algal symbiosis) and coral
   mortality. In this study, the effects of bleaching (induced by elevated
   light and temperature) on the condition of symbiotic dinoflagellates
   (Symbiodinium sp.) within the tissue of the hard coral Stylophora
   pistillata (Esper) were assessed using a suite of techniques. Bleaching
   of S. pistillata was accompanied by declines in the maximum potential
   quantum yield of photosynthesis (F-v/F-m, measured using pulse amplitude
   modulated {[}PAM] fluorometry), an increase in the number of
   Sytox-green-stained algae (indicating compromised algal membrane
   integrity and cell death), an increase in
   2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluroscein diacetate (H(2)DCFDA)stained algae
   (indicating increased oxidative stress), as well as ultrastructural
   changes (vacuolisation, losses of chlorophyll, and an increase in
   accumulation bodies). Algae expelled from S. pistillata exhibited a
   complete disorganisation of cellular contents; expelled cells contained
   only amorphous material. In situ samples taken during a natural mass
   coral bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef in February 2002 also
   revealed a high number of Sytox-labelled algae cells in symbio.
   Dinoflagellate degeneration during bleaching seems to be similar to the
   changes resulting from senescence-phase cell death in cultured algae.
   These data support a role for oxidative stress in the mechanism of coral
   bleaching and highlight the importance of algal degeneration during the
   bleaching of a reef coral.},

Title = {Effect of light and temperature on calcification and strontium uptake in
   the scleractinian coral <i>Acropora verweyi</i>},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {279},
Pages = {105-112},
Abstract = {Strontium thermometry has been suggested as a powerful tool for
   reconstructing seawater surface temperature (SST). In corals, an inverse
   relationship between SST and skeletal Sr/Ca ratios has been found.
   However, this ratio might also vary with calcification, which in turn is
   dependent on light and temperature. The aim of this study was to improve
   our knowledge of the uptake of Sr2+ as a function of light and
   temperature in the scleractinian coral Acropora verweyi. Two experiments
   were performed in which nubbins were acclimated over 4 wk either to 3
   light intensities (100, 200 and 400 mumol m(-2) s(1)) or to 3
   temperatures (20, 25, and 29degreesC) and growth rates were monitored.
   At the end of the 4 wk, nubbins were incubated, under the above light
   levels and temperatures, in individual beakers containing seawater
   spiked with the radiotracer Sr-85. Parallel incubations were carried out
   in dark beakers, in order to compare rates of Sr2+ incorporation in
   light and dark. The results obtained showed that growth rates were
   significantly higher under high light (0.16 +/- 0.01 and 0.27 +/- 0.01\%
   d(-1) for 100 and 400 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1)) and under high
   temperature (0.06 +/- 0.01\% d(-1) at 20degreesC to 0.35 +/- 0.03\%
   d(-1) at 29degreesC). Rates of Sr2+ incorporation into the coral
   skeleton were also higher under high light (32.4 +/- 3.0, 72.9 +/- 13.5
   and 91.2 +/- 9.0 nmol (g dry weight, DW)(-1) d(-1), for corals cultured
   at 100, 200 and 400 mumol m(-2) s(-1) respectively) and high temperature
   (89 +/- 14, 224 +/- 38 and 436 +/- 58 nmol (g DW)(-1) d(-1) for corals
   cultured at 20, 25 and 29degreesC respectively). Rates of Sr2+ uptake
   were also 2 to 3 times lower in the dark than in the light, comparable
   with the incorporation of calcium. Our results finally show a strong
   correlation between Sr2+ uptake and growth rates. Strontium uptake
   therefore follows the same pattern as calcium uptake, both ions being
   regulated by the calcification biochemistry.},

Title = {Morpho-functional traits of the coral <i>Stylophora pistillata</i>
   enhance light capture for photosynthesis at mesophotic depths},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 24},
Abstract = {The morphological architecture of photosynthetic corals modulates the
   light capture and functioning of the coral-algal symbiosis on
   shallow-water corals. Since corals can thrive on mesophotic reefs under
   extreme light-limited conditions, we hypothesized that microskeletal
   coral features enhance light capture under low-light environments.
   Utilizing micro-computed tomography scanning, we conducted a novel
   comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) assessment of the small-scale
   skeleton morphology of the depth-generalist coral Stylophora pistillata
   collected from shallow (4-5 m) and mesophotic (45-50 m) depths. We
   detected a high phenotypic diversity between depths, resulting in two
   distinct morphotypes, with calyx diameter, theca height, and corallite
   marginal spacing contributing to most of the variation between depths.
   To determine whether such depth-specific morphotypes affect coral light
   capture and photosynthesis on the corallite scale, we developed 3D
   simulations of light propagation and photosynthesis. We found that
   microstructural features of corallites from mesophotic corals provide a
   greater ability to use solar energy under light-limited conditions;
   while corals associated with shallow morphotypes avoided excess light
   through self-shading skeletal architectures. The results from our study
   suggest that skeleton morphology plays a key role in coral
   photoadaptation to light-limited environments.
   Micro-computed tomography scanning and 3D light simulation models
   reveals distinct morphotypes of the coral species Stylophora pistillata
   depending on depth, and suggest that coral skeletal micromorphology
   plays a key role in coral photoadaptation.},

Abstract = {Temperature is a key driver of metabolic rates. So far, we know little
   about potential physiological adjustments of subtropical corals to
   seasonal temperature changes (>8 degrees C) that substantially exceed
   temperature fluctuation experienced by their counterparts in the
   tropics. This study investigated the effect of temperature reductions on
   Montastraea cavemosa and Ponies astreoides in Bermuda (32 degrees N; sea
   surface temperature similar to 19-29 degrees C) over 5 weeks, applying
   the following treatments: (i) constant control temperature at 28 degrees
   C, and (ii) temperature reduction (0.5 degrees C day(-1)) followed by
   constant temperature (20 days; acclimatization period) at 24 degrees C
   and (iii) at 20 degrees C. Both species decreased photosynthesis and
   respiration during temperature reduction as expected, which continued to
   decrease during the acclimatization period, indicating adjustment to a
   low energy turnover rather than thermal compensation. Trajectories of
   physiological adjustments and level of thermal compensation, however,
   differed between species. Montastraea cavemosa zooxanthellae metrics
   showed a strong initial response to temperature reduction, followed by a
   return to close to control values during the acclimatization period,
   reflecting a high physiological flexibility and low thermal
   compensation. Ponies astreoides zooxanthellae, in contrast, showed no
   initial response, but an increase in pigment concentration per
   zooxanthellae and similar photosynthesis rates at 24 degrees C and 20
   degrees C at the end of the experiment, indicating low acute thermal
   sensitivity and the ability for thermal compensation at the lowest
   temperature. Respiration decreased more strongly than photosynthesis,
   leading to significant build-up of biomass in both species (energy
   reserves). Results are important in the light of potential poleward
   migration of corals and of potential latitudinal and species-specific
   differences in coral thermal tolerance.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are threatened by global and local impacts, such as ocean
   acidification (OA) and metal contamination. Toxicity of metals, such as
   copper (Cu), is expected to be enhanced with OA. However, the
   interaction between these environmental stressors is still poorly
   evaluated. In the present study, the interactive effects of seawater
   acidification and increasing Cu concentrations were evaluated in a
   zooxanthellate scleractinian coral (Mussismilia harttii), using
   biochemical biomarkers involved in the coral calcification process and
   the photosynthetic metabolism of endosymbionts. Corals were kept under
   control conditions (no seawater acidification and no Cu addition in
   seawater) or exposed to combined treatments of reduced seawater pH (8.1,
   7.8, 7.5 and 7.2) and environmentally relevant concentrations of
   dissolved Cu (measured: 1.0, 1.6, 2.3 and 3.2 mu g/L) in a mesocosm
   system. After 15- and 35-days exposure, corals were analyzed for
   photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), chlorophyll a content, Ca-ATPase and
   carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity. Results showed that 76\% of the
   interactions between reduced seawater pH and increasing Cu
   concentrations were antagonistic. Only 24\% of these interactions were
   additive or synergistic. In general, the combination of stressors had no
   significant deleterious effects in the photosynthetic metabolism of
   endosymbionts or Ca-ATPase activity. In fact, the lowest dissolved Cu
   concentration tested had a consistent positive effect on Ca-ATPase
   activity in corals facing any of the reduced seawater pH conditions
   tested. In turn, potentially deleterious effects on acid-base balance in
   M. harttii, associated with changes in CA activity, were intensified by
   the combination of stressors. Findings reported here indicate that Cu
   toxicity in future OA scenarios can be less severe than previously
   suggested in this coral holobiont.},

Abstract = {In a coral-algae symbiotic system, heat-dependent photoinhibition of

   coral Acropora digitifera was exposed to light, a moderate increase of
   temperature induced coral bleaching through photobleaching of algal
   pigments, but not through expulsion of symbiotic algae. Monitoring of
   PSII photoinhibition revealed that heat-dependent photoinhibition was
   ascribed to inhibition of the repair of photodamaged PSII, and heat
   susceptibility of the repair machinery varied among coral species. We
   conclude that the efficiency of the photosynthesis repair machinery
   determines the bleaching susceptibility of coral species under elevated
   seawater temperatures.},

Abstract = {Concomitant to the decline of tropical corals caused by increasing
   global sea temperatures is the potential removal of barriers to species
   range expansions into subtropical and temperate habitats. In these
   habitats, species must tolerate lower annual mean temperature, wider
   annual temperature ranges and lower minimum temperatures. To understand
   ecophysiological traits that will impact geographical range boundaries,
   we monitored populations of five coral species within a marginal habitat
   and used a year of in situ measures to model thermal performance of
   vital host, symbiont and holobiont physiology. Metabolic responses to
   temperature revealed two acclimatization strategies: peak productivity
   occurring at annual midpoint temperatures (4-6 degrees C lower than
   tropical counterparts), or at annual maxima. Modelled relationships
   between temperature and P:R were compared to a year of daily subtropical
   sea temperatures and revealed that the relatively short time spent at
   any one temperature, limited optimal performance of all strategies to
   approximately half the days of the year. Thus, while subtropical corals
   can adjust their physiology to persist through seasonal lows, seasonal
   variation seems to be the key factor limiting coral productivity. This
   constraint on rapid reef accretion within subtropical environments
   provides insight into the global distribution of future coral reefs and
   their ecosystem services.},

Abstract = {Photosynthesis and calcification in zooxanthellate scleractinian corals
   and coral reefs are reviewed at several scales: cellular (pathways and
   transport mechanisms of inorganic carbon and calcium), organismal
   (interaction between photosynthesis and calcification, effect of light)
   and ecosystemic (community primary production and calcification, and
   air-sea CO2 exchanges).
   The coral host plays a major role in supplying carbon for the
   photosynthesis by the algal symbionts through a system similar to the
   carbon-concentrating mechanism described in free living algal cells;The
   details of carbon supply to the calcification process are almost
   unknown, but metabolic CO2 seems to be a significant source; Calcium
   supply for calcification is diffusional through oral layers, and active
   membrane transport only occurs between the calicoblastic cells and the
   site of calcification. Photosynthesis and calcification are tightly
   coupled in zooxanthellate scleractinian corals and coral reef
   communities. Calcification Is, on average, three times higher in light
   than in darkness. The recent suggestion that calcification is
   dark-repressed rather than light-enhanced is not supported by the
   literature. There is a very strong correlation between photosynthesis
   and calcification at both the organism and community levels, but the
   ratios of calcification to gross photosynthesis (0.6 in corals and 0.2
   in reef communities) differ from unity, and from each other as a
   function of level.
   The potential effect of global climatic changes (pCO(2) and temperature)
   on the rate of calcification is also reviewed. In various calcifying
   photosynthetic organisms and communities, the rate of calcification
   decreases as a function of increasing pCO(2) and decreasing calcium
   carbonate saturation state, The calculated decrease in CaCO3 production,
   estimated using the scenarios considered by the International Panel on
   Climate Change (IPCC), is 10\% between 1880 and 1990, and 9-30\% (mid
   estimate: 22\%) from 1990 to 2100. Inadequate understanding of the
   mechanism of calcification and its interaction with photosynthesis
   severely limits the ability to provide an accurate prediction of future
   changes in the rate of calcification.},

Abstract = {The dinoflagellate Symbiodinium trenchii associates with a wide array of
   host corals throughout the world, and its thermal tolerance has made it
   of particular interest within the context of reef coral resilience to a
   warming climate. However, future reefs are increasingly likely to face
   combined environmental stressors, further complicating our understanding
   of how S. trenchii will possibly acclimatize to future climate
   scenarios. Over a 33-day period, we characterized the individual and
   combined affects of high temperature (26.5 vs. 31.5 degrees C), pCO(2)
   (400 vs. 760 mu atm), and elevated nutrients (0.4 and 0.2 vs. 3.5 and
   0.3 mu mol of NO3/NO2 and PO43-, respectively) on S. trenchii within the
   host coral species Turbinaria reniformis. Global analysis across all
   treatments found temperature to be the largest driver of physiological
   change. However, exposure to elevated temperature led to changes in
   symbiont physiology that differed across pCO(2) concentrations. Net
   photosynthesis and cellular chlorophyll a increased with temperature
   under ambient pCO(2), whereas temperature-related differences in
   cellular volume and its affect on pigment packaging were more pronounced
   under elevated pCO(2). Furthermore, increased nutrients mitigated the
   physiological response to high temperature under both ambient and
   elevated pCO(2) conditions and represented a significant interaction
   between all three physical parameters. Individual responses to
   temperature and pCO(2) were also observed as cellular density declined
   with elevated temperature and calcification along with respiration rates
   declined with increased pCO(2). Symbiodinium trenchii remained the
   dominant symbiont population within the host across all treatment
   combinations. Our results reveal distinct physiological changes in
   response to high temperature within the S. trenchii/T. reniformis
   symbioses that are dependent on pCO(2) and nutrient concentration, and
   represent important interactive effects to consider as we consider how
   corals will respond under future climate change scenarios.},

Abstract = {Tropical reef-building coral stress levels will intensify with the
   predicted rising atmospheric CO2 resulting in ocean temperature and
   acidification increase. Most studies to date have focused on the
   destabilization of coral-dinoflagellate symbioses due to warming oceans,
   or declining calcification due to ocean acidification. In our study, pH
   and temperature conditions consistent with the end-of-century scenarios
   of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) caused major
   changes in photosynthesis and respiration, in addition to decreased
   calcification rates in the coral Acropora millepora. Population density
   of symbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium) under high levels of ocean
   acidification and temperature (Representative Concentration Pathway,
   RCP8.5) decreased to half of that found under present day conditions,
   with photosynthetic and respiratory rates also being reduced by 40\%.
   These physiological changes were accompanied by evidence for gene
   regulation of calcium and bicarbonate transporters along with components
   of the organic matrix. Meta-transcriptomic RNA-Seq data analyses showed
   an overall down regulation of metabolic transcripts, and an increased
   abundance of transcripts involved in circadian clock control,
   controlling the damage of oxidative stress, calcium
   signaling/homeostasis, cytoskeletal interactions, transcription
   regulation, DNA repair, Wnt signaling and apoptosis/immunity/toxins. We
   suggest that increased maintenance costs under ocean acidification and
   warming, and diversion of cellular ATP to pH homeostasis, oxidative
   stress response, UPR and DNA repair, along with metabolic suppression,
   may underpin why Acroporid species tend not to thrive under future
   environmental stress. Our study highlights the potential increased
   energy demand when the coral holobiont is exposed to high levels of
   ocean warming and acidification.},

Abstract = {Given the threat of climate change towards scleractinian corals, there
   is an urgent need to understand their physiological mechanisms of
   acclimation to increasing temperatures. To gain insight into this
   process, two mesocosm-based experiments were conducted in Southern
   Taiwan with the model reef-building coral Pocillopora damicornis. In the
   first study, temperature was gradually elevated to 32 degrees C, though
   reduced to ambient levels at night, in order to simulate a temperature
   profile that can characterize intertidal reefs of Southern Taiwan. All
   corals acclimated to such conditions over the course of the month-long
   experiment, as evidenced by a variety of physiological and sub-cellular
   responses. In the second experiment, corals were exposed continually to
   31.5 degrees C for two weeks, and, in contrast to results from the first
   study, the majority of the corals died, revealing that prolonged
   exposure to this temperature is lethal for this dominant reef builder of
   many regions of the Pacific Ocean. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The coral-bleaching bacterium Vibrio shiloi biosynthesizes and secretes
   an extracellular peptide, referred to as toxin P, which inhibits
   photosynthesis of coral symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae). Toxin P was
   produced during the stationary phase when the bacterium was grown on
   peptone or Casamino Acids media at 29 degreesC. Glycerol inhibited the
   production of toxin P. Toxin P was purified to homogeneity, yielding the
   following 12-residue peptide: PYPVYAPPPVVP (molecular weight, 1,295.54).
   The structure of toxin P was confirmed by chemical synthesis. Tn the
   presence of 12.5 mM NH4Cl, pure natural or synthetic toxin P (10 muM)
   caused a 64\% decrease in the photosynthetic quantum yield of
   zooxanthellae within 5 min. The inhibition nas proportional to the toxin
   P concentration. Toxin P bound avidly to zooxanthellae, such that
   subsequent addition of NK,CI resulted in rapid inhibition of
   photosynthesis. When zooxanthellae were incubated in the presence of
   NH,CI and toxin P, there was a rapid decrease in the pH (pH 7.8 to 7.2)
   of the bulk liquid, suggesting that toxin P facilitates transport of NH,
   into the cell, It is known that uptake of NH, into cells can destroy the
   pH gradient and block photosynthesis. This mode of action of toxin P can
   help explain the mechanism of coral bleaching by V.shiloi.},

Title = {Integrated metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses reveal bacterial
   micro-ecological mechanisms in coral bleaching},
Journal = {MSYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 26},
Abstract = {Coral bleaching has been rapidly increasing in recent years due to
   abnormally elevated temperature, leading to massive damage to coral
   reefs worldwide. Understanding the processes and micro-ecological
   mechanisms of coral symbionts in response to bleaching is crucial as
   evidence accumulates that micro-organisms (particularly the bacteria)
   contribute to the health and recovery of coral, especially during heat
   stress. However, the exact functional mechanism of bacteria has not yet
   been fully elucidated. In this study, we performed metagenomic and
   metaproteomic analyses of healthy and bleached Acropora muricata corals
   to identify taxonomic and functional shifts in coral symbionts during a
   natural thermal bleaching event on Hainan Island. The results showed
   that symbiont species tended to be more abundant in bleached corals than
   healthy corals, and the bacterial community appeared to be crucial to
   coral bleaching. The relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens
   dramatically increased in bleached corals, accompanied by the reduction
   of beneficial bacteria. In addition, a direct comparison of metagenomic
   data sets indicated major changes in functional genes, with bleached
   corals exhibiting significant metabolic enrichment, while healthy corals
   maintained lower metabolism and energy consumption. Carbohydrate-active
   enzyme genes were remarkably activated, and virulence factors were
   highly represented in bleached corals, which was directly related to the
   increased abundance of pathogenic bacteria. Metaproteomic analysis also
   demonstrated that bleaching greatly affected photosynthesis and energy
   metabolism of coral symbionts. Among them, the biological processes of
   photosynthesis and chlorophyll biosynthesis were common in healthy
   corals, while pathways involved in gluconeogenesis and apoptosis were
   significantly enriched in bleached corals. Bacteria-mediated processes
   in healthy corals contribute to maintaining the basic functions of
   symbionts and resisting stress, whereas the proliferation of pathogenic
   bacteria in bleached corals leads to metabolic abnormalities of
   symbionts, showing enhanced energy metabolism and catalytic activity. In
   summary, the two omics analyzes revealed that bleaching caused enormous
   physiological damage to corals, and bacterial imbalance and dysfunction
   were the potential micro-ecological mechanisms underlying this
   event.IMPORTANCECoral reefs worldwide are facing rapid decline due to
   coral bleaching. However, knowledge of the physiological characteristics
   and molecular mechanisms of coral symbionts respond to stress is scarce.
   Here, metagenomic and metaproteomic approaches were utilized to shed
   light on the changes in the composition and functions of coral symbiotic
   bacteria during coral bleaching. The results demonstrated that coral
   bleaching significantly affected the composition of symbionts, with
   bacterial communities dominating in bleached corals. Through
   differential analyses of gene and protein expression, it becomes evident
   that symbionts experience functional disturbances in response to heat
   stress. These disturbances result in abnormal energy metabolism, which
   could potentially compromise the health and resilience of the symbionts.
   Furthermore, our findings highlighted the highly diverse microbial
   communities of coral symbionts, with beneficial bacteria providing
   critical services to corals in stress responses and pathogenic bacteria
   driving coral bleaching.
   This study provides comprehensive insights into the complex response
   mechanisms of coral symbionts under heat stress from the
   micro-ecological perspective and offers fundamental data for future
   monitoring of coral health.

Abstract = {Thermal stress causes the coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis to disassociate
   and the coral tissues to whiten. The onset and occurrence of this coral
   bleaching is primarily defined via the dinoflagellate responses. Here we
   demonstrate that thermal stress responses occur in the coral host
   tissues in the days before the onset of coral bleaching. The observed
   sequence of thermal responses includes reductions in thickness of coral
   tissue layers and apoptosis of the cells prior to reductions in symbiont
   density. In the days before the onset of coral bleaching the outer coral
   tissue layer (epithelium) thickness reduces and apoptosis occurs within
   the gastrodermis. Two days following this, coinciding with an initial
   reduction of symbiont density (by approximately 25\%), gastrodermal
   thickness decreased and apoptosis of host cells was identified in the
   epithelium. This was eventually followed by large reduction in symbiont
   density (by approximately 50\%) consistent with coral bleaching. Both
   pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes are identified in the reef
   building coral Acropora aspera, demonstrating the necessary pathways are
   present for fine control of host apoptosis. Our study shows that
   defining periods of host stress based on the responses defined by
   dinoflagellate symbiont underestimates the importance of early cellular
   events and the cellular complexity of coral host. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{[}1] The extremely high temporal resolution ( nearly daily interval)
   measurement was conducted on the coral (Porites lutea) oxygen isotope
   compositions (delta(18)Oc) to examine the detailed relationship between
   delta(18)Oc and sea surface temperature (SST) and seawater oxygen
   isotope composition (delta(18)Ow) from Hainan Island, China. Although
   SST and sea surface salinity (SSS) or delta(18)Ow varied in a wide range
   at the studied site, the dynamic range of delta(18)Oc recorded in coral
   was much smaller than expected from SST and SSS (delta(18)Ow) changes.
   The extremely high (> 30 degrees C) and low (< 22 degrees C) SST and low
   (< 27) SSS are not suitable for coral calcification, and coral could not
   record the information as their skeletal delta O-18. Estimated coral
   extension rates ( the overall rate is 15 mm/year) varied by a factor of
   about 18 within one year, from very slow in winter to very fast in
   spring. Light availability could affect the extension rate of coral
   skeleton through the activity of photosynthesis of symbiont algae. Such
   cessation and acceleration of calcification cause a serious distortion
   of the delta O-18 profile, which makes it difficult to make a
   correlation between delta O-18 and SST. Because high and low extension
   rates correspond to low- and high-density bands, respectively, a
   detailed examination of the density structure may assist the correction
   for distortion of the delta O-18 profile.},

Title = {Photosynthesis in a green alga (zoochlorella), <i>Chlorella</i> cf.
   <i>vulgaris</i> in the soft coral <i>Sarcophyton</i> sp.},
Journal = {PHYCOLOGIA},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 28},
Abstract = {An undescribed variety of the green alga Chlorella cf. vulgaris was
   found living in the octocoral (soft coral) Sarcophyton sp., which also
   has dinoflagellate zooxanthellae. The green alga is present in very
   small numbers and is capable of photoheterotrophy based on growth in the
   presence of an inhibitor of photosynthesis, DCMU, with glycerol provided
   as a carbon source. The presence of zoochlorellae (Chl a + b), in soft
   corals appears to have been unsuspected. The easily cultured green alga
   was unicellular, unflagellated and very small, c. 2 to 6 mu m in
   diameter and had a relatively high Chl b content (Chl b/a = 0.379 +/-
   0.063). Rapid light curves using PAM fluorometry on the cultured cells
   showed that Yield vs. irradiance had a low maximum yield (Y-max, 0.388
   +/- 0.0132; Irradiance 1/2 point, E-1/2 Ymax = 139 +/- 11.1 mu mol
   photon m(-2) s(-1)). The overall optimum irradiance (E-opt) for the alga
   was 314 +/- 18.8 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1). The alga can photosynthesize
   at 50\% or more of the optimum rate from 70 to 900 mu mol photon m(-2)
   s(-1) but would be severely inhibited under full sunlight. Most
   naturally occurring low irradiance habitats may have a low median
   irradiance but are exposed intermittently to very high irradiances and
   so a relatively high E-opt is advantageous in minimizing photochemical
   damage. Like the green algal symbiont Elliptochloris marina of sea
   anemones, Chlorella cf. vulgaris is not exclusively marine: it grows
   better in freshwater medium where it has different photosynthetic
   characteristics (higher Y-max, E-opt and ETRmax). Chlorella cf. vulgaris
   appears to be capable of photoheterotrophy and it is not clear if it is
   a symbiont, a commensal or a parasite.},

Abstract = {Coral bleaching involves the loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates
   (zooxanthellae) from reef corals and other cnidarians and may be a
   stress response of the host, algae or both. To determine the role of
   zooxanthellae in the bleaching process, aposymbiotic sea anemones from
   Bermuda (Aiptasia pallida) were infected with symbionts from other sea
   anemones (Aiptasia pallida from Florida, Bartholomea annulata and
   Condylactis gigantea). The expulsion of algae was measured during 24-h
   incubations at 25, 32 and 34 degreesC. Photosynthetic rates of freshly
   isolated zooxanthellae were also measured at these temperatures. The C.
   gigantea (Cg) symbionts were expelled in higher numbers than the other
   algae at 32 degreesC. Photosynthesis by the Cg algae was completely
   inhibited at this temperature, in contrast to the other symbionts. At 34
   degrees all of the symbionts had increased expulsion rates, and at this
   temperature only the symbionts from Florida A. pallida exhibited any
   photosynthesis. These results provide the first evidence that the
   differential release of symbionts from the same host species is related
   to decreased photosynthesis at elevated temperatures, and support other
   findings suggesting that zooxanthellae are directly affected by elevated
   temperatures during bleaching events. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science BN. All

Abstract = {Global degradation of coral reefs has increased the urgency of
   identifying stress-tolerant coral populations, to enhance understanding
   of the biology driving stress tolerance, as well as identifying stocks
   of stress-hardened populations to aid reef rehabilitation. Surprisingly,
   scientists are continually discovering that naturally extreme
   environments house established coral populations adapted to grow within
   extreme abiotic conditions comparable to seawater conditions predicted
   over the coming century. Such environments include inshore mangrove
   lagoons that carry previously unrecognised ecosystem service value for
   corals, spanning from refuge to stress preconditioning. However, the
   existence of such hot-spots of resilience on the Great Barrier Reef
   (GBR) remains entirely unknown. Here we describe, for the first time, 2
   extreme GBR mangrove lagoons (Woody Isles and Howick Island), exposing
   taxonomically diverse coral communities (34 species, 7 growth
   morphologies) to regular extreme low pH (<7.6), low oxygen (<1 mg l(-1))
   and highly variable temperature range (>7 degrees C) conditions. Coral
   cover was typically low (<5 \%), but highly patchy and included
   established colonies (>0.5 m diameter), with net photosynthesis and
   calcification rates of 2 dominant coral species (Acropora millepora,
   Porites lutea) reduced (20-30 \%), and respiration enhanced (11-35 \%),
   in the mangrove lagoon relative to adjacent reefs. Further analysis
   revealed that physiological plasticity (photosynthetic `strategy') and
   flexibility of Symbiodiniaceae taxa associations appear crucial in
   supporting coral capacity to thrive from reef to lagoon. Prevalence of
   corals within these extreme conditions on the GBR (and elsewhere)
   increasingly challenge our understanding of coral resilience to
   stressors, and highlight the need to study unfavourable coral
   environments to better resolve mechanisms of stress tolerance.},

Abstract = {Coral holobionts (i.e., coral-algal-prokaryote symbioses) exhibit
   dissimilar thermal sensitivities that may determine which coral species
   will adapt to global warming. Nonetheless, studies simultaneously
   investigating the effects of warming on all holobiont members are
   lacking. Here we show that exposure to increased temperature affects key
   physiological traits of all members (herein: animal host, zooxanthellae
   and diazotrophs) of both Stylophora pistillata and Acropora hemprichii
   during and after thermal stress. S. pistillata experienced severe loss
   of zooxanthellae (i.e., bleaching) with no net photosynthesis at the end
   of the experiment. Conversely, A. hemprichii was more resilient to
   thermal stress. Exposure to increased temperature (+ 6 degrees C)
   resulted in a drastic increase in daylight dinitrogen (N-2) fixation,
   particularly in A. hemprichii (threefold compared with controls). After
   the temperature was reduced again to in situ levels, diazotrophs
   exhibited a reversed diel pattern of activity, with increased N-2
   fixation rates recorded only in the dark, particularly in bleached S.
   pistillata (twofold compared to controls). Concurrently, both animal
   hosts, but particularly bleached S. pistillata, reduced both organic
   matter release and heterotrophic feeding on picoplankton. Our findings
   indicate that physiological plasticity by coral-associated diazotrophs
   may play an important role in determining the response of coral
   holobionts to ocean warming.},

Abstract = {To understand the effects of global climate change on reef-building
   corals, a thorough investigation of their physiological mechanisms of
   acclimatization is warranted. However, static temperature manipulations
   may underestimate the thermal complexity of the reefs in which many
   corals live. For instance, corals of Houbihu, Taiwan, experience changes
   in temperature of up to 10 degrees C over the course of a day during
   spring-tide upwelling events. To better understand the phenotypic
   plasticity of these corals, a laboratory-based experiment was conducted
   whereby specimens of Seriatopora hystrix from an upwelling reef
   (Houbihu) and conspecifics from a non-upwelling reef (Houwan) were
   exposed to both a stable seawater temperature (26 degrees C) regime and
   a regime characterized by a 6 degrees C fluctuation (23-29 degrees C)
   over a 12. h period for 7. days. A suite of physiological and molecular
   parameters was measured in samples of both treatments, as well as in
   experimental controls, to determine site of origin (SO) and temperature
   treatment (TT) responses. Only chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration and
   growth demonstrated the hypothesized trend of higher levels when exposed
   to a TT that mimicked SO conditions. In contrast, chl a, maximum
   dark-adapted quantum yield of photosystem II (F-v/F-m), and Symbiodinium
   ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rbcL), photosystem I
   (psI, subunit III) and phosphoglycolate phosphatase (pgpase) mRNA
   expression demonstrated significant TT effects. Specifically, levels of
   these response variables were higher in samples exposed to a variable
   temperature regime, suggesting that S. hystrix may acclimate to
   fluctuating temperatures by increasing its capacity for photosynthesis.},

Title = {Effects of nanostructure antifouling biocides towards a coral species in

Abstract = {Biofouling prevention is one of the biggest challenges faced by the
   maritime industry, but antifouling agents commonly impact marine
   ecosystems. Advances in antifouling technology include the use of
   nanomaterials. Herein we test an antifouling nano-additive based on the
   encapsulation of the biocide 4,5-dichloro-2-octyl-4isothiazolin-3-one
   (DCOIT) in engineered silica nanocontainers (SiNC). The work aims to
   assess the biochemical and physiological effects on the symbiotic coral
   Sarcophyton cf. glaucum caused by (1) thermal stress and (2) DCOIT
   exposure (free or nanoencapsulated forms), in a climate change scenario.
   Accordingly, the following hypotheses were addressed: (H1) ocean warming
   can cause toxicity on S. cf. glaucum; (H2) the nanoencapsulation process
   decreases DCOIT toxicity towards this species; (H3) the biocide
   toxicity, free or encapsulated forms, can be affected by ocean warming.
   Coral fragments were exposed for seven days to DCOIT in both free and
   encapsulated forms, SiNC and negative controls, under two water
   temperature regimes (26 degrees C and 30.5 degrees C). Coral polyp
   behavior and photosynthetic efficiency were determined in the holobiont,
   while biochemical markers were assessed individually in the endosymbiont
   and coral host. Results showed transient coral polyp retraction and
   diminished photosynthetic efficiency in the presence of heat stress or
   free DCOIT, with effects being magnified in the presence of both
   stressors. The activity of catalase and glutathione-S-transferase were
   modulated by temperature in each partner of the symbiosis. The shifts in
   enzymatic activity were more pronounced in the presence of free DCOIT,
   but to a lower extent for encapsulated DCOIT. Increased levels of
   oxidative damage were detected under heat conditions. The findings
   highlight the physiological constrains elicited by the increase of
   seawater temperature to symbiotic},

Title = {Reduced expression of the rate-limiting carbon fixation enzyme RuBisCO

   response to heat shock},

Abstract = {Baculogypsina sphaerulata (Parker and Jones, 1860) is a common large
   benthic foraminifer (LBF) and is an important calcifier in coral reef
   ecosystems. As there are concerns that global increasing temperatures
   may compromise the survival of this species, which forms a symbiotic
   relationship with the diatom Nitzschia sp., we investigated the response
   of the B. sphaerulata holobiont from the intertidal algal flats of Xiao
   Liu Chiu Island, Taiwan to heat shock B. sphaerulata specimens were
   incubated at 26 (ambient), 28, 30, 32, or 34 degrees C for 5 h designed
   to simulate short pulses of elevated temperature that occur in situ from
   subaerial exposure at low tide. To assess the molecular-level response,
   we measured the expression of the ribulose 1-5-bisphosphate
   carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) protein in the diatom symbiont There was
   a significant decrease in expression of this rate-limiting carbon
   fixation enzyme in B. sphaerulata holobionts incubated at 34 degrees C/8
   degrees C above ambient (similar to 50\% decline relative to controls),
   but expression was resilient to levels of warming up to 6 degrees C
   above ambient. This suggests that exposure to high temperatures
   occasionally experienced in nature may diminish the capacity for carbon
   fixation of the diatom symbiont. Given the importance of photosynthesis
   and carbon fixation in these marine calcifiers, these data suggest that
   climate-driven ocean warming may exert deleterious effects on the B.
   sphaerulata holobiont. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Coral cell cultures made from reef-building scleractinian corals have
   the potential to aid in the pursuit of understanding of the
   cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis. Various methods have previously been
   described for the production of cell cultures in vitro with a range of
   success and longevity. In this study, viable tissue spheroids containing
   host tissue and symbionts (coral explants) were grown from the tissues
   of Fungia granulosa. The cultured explants remained viable for over 2
   months and showed morphological similarities in tissue structure and
   internal microenvironment to reef-building scleractinian corals. The
   photophysiology of the explants (1 week old) closely matched that of the
   parent coral F. granulosa. This study provides the first empirical basis
   for supporting the use of coral explants as laboratory models for
   studying coral symbioses. In particular, it highlights how these small,
   self-sustaining, skeleton-free models can be useful for a number of
   molecular, genetic and physiological analyses necessary for
   investigating host-symbiont interactions at the microscale.},

Title = {Effect of temperature and feeding on carbon budgets and O<sub>2</sub>

Volume = {652},

Abstract = {Studying carbon dynamics in the coral holobiont provides essential
   knowledge of nutritional strategies and is thus central to understanding
   coral ecophysiology. In this study, we assessed the carbon budget in
   Pocillopora damicornis (using (HCO3)-C-13) as a function of feeding
   status and temperature stress. We also compared dissolved oxygen (O-2)
   fluxes measured at the colony scale and at the polyp scale. At both
   scales, O-2 production rates were enhanced for fed vs. unfed corals, and
   unfed corals exhibited higher bleaching and reduced photosynthetic
   activity at high temperature. Unfed corals exclusively respired
   autotrophically acquired carbon, while fed corals mostly respired
   heterotrophically acquired carbon. As a consequence, fed corals excreted
   on average > 5 times more organic carbon than unfed corals.
   Photosynthate translocation was higher under thermal stress, but most of
   the carbon was lost via respiration and/or mucus release (42-46\% and
   57-75\% of the fixed carbon for unfed and fed corals, respectively).
   Such high loss of translocated carbon, coupled to low assimilation rates
   in the coral tissue and symbionts, suggests that P. damicornis was
   nitrogen and/or phosphorus limited. Heterotrophy might thus cover a
   larger portion of the nutritional demand for P. damicornis than
   previously assumed. Our results suggest that active feeding plays a
   fundamental role in metabolic dynamics and bleaching susceptibility of
   corals.},

   Different Symbiodiniaceae Endosymbiont Species of Cnidaria},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Coral reefs are endangered by constantly rising water temperature due to
   global warming. This triggers a breakdown of the nutritional symbiosis
   between cnidarian hosts and their Symbiodiniaceae symbionts, resulting
   in the loss of the algal partner. In the Symbiodiniaceae exists a high
   genetic diversity with broad physiological plasticity within and between
   species, resulting in large thermal tolerance. While these variations
   have been studied in individual taxa, comprehensive comparative
   experimental data on numerous species are still rare. In the present
   study, the photosynthetic performance and tolerance as function of light
   and temperature of nine Symbiodiniaceae genetic types of four different
   clades were determined. The data indicate significant differences in the
   response patterns. Almost all algal isolates exhibited low to moderate
   light requirements for photosynthesis without photoinhibition, and a
   photosynthetic efficiency between 20 and 80\% in the temperature range
   20-34 degrees C, indicating a broad thermal tolerance to temperature
   fluctuations in tropical regions. The presented data clearly point to a
   broad photophysiological tolerance and thermal plasticity of genetically
   different Symbiodiniaceae, which contributes as an important finding to
   a better understanding of host-symbiont response to an increasing sea
   surface temperature.},

Title = {Estimate of calcification responses to thermal and freshening stresses

Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2012},

Abstract = {Although coral calcification is directly related to coral health, few
   studies have examined the responses of coral calcification to
   environmental stresses, with the exception of ocean acidification. In
   this study, we experimentally exposed aposymbiotic (lacking symbionts)
   and symbiotic primary polyps of the scleractinian coral Acropora
   digitifera to several seawater temperatures (27, 29, 31, and 33 degrees
   C) and salinities (26, 28. 30, 32, and 34) to investigate the effects of
   thermal and freshening stresses on coral calcification from the
   standpoint of coral-algal symbiosis. Calcification rates were higher for
   symbiotic versus aposymbiotic polyps in both sets of experiments, except
   for those reared at 31 degrees C and 33 degrees C. Calcification
   responses of symbiotic polyps were a non-linear function of temperature,
   and the threshold temperature affecting skeletal growth and bleaching
   was between 29 degrees C and 31 degrees C. Calcification rates of
   aposymbiotic polyps were also a non-linear function of temperature, with
   a maximum polyp weight at 31 degrees C, suggesting that thermal stress
   also did some damage to the coral host itself. In contrast, skeletal
   growth of both aposymbiotic and symbiotic polyps decreased linearly with
   increased salinity. Observations of the microstructure of polyp samples
   revealed a clearly cyclic feature of skeletal surfaces that was likely
   related to organo-mineral deposition of calcium carbonate even under
   lowered-salinity conditions. However, neither type of polyp reared at 33
   degrees C evidenced this characteristic, suggesting that thermal stress
   had compromised the normal calcification process, which involves
   secretion of an organic matrix by the coral host. Our results suggest
   that the effects of future global warming will include a reduction in
   coral calcification itself and the collapse of coral-algal symbiosis, at
   least at the primary polyp stage. The present experiments showed that
   thermal stress would affect the host's physiological functionality,
   whereas freshening stress, which is simply the dilution of ambient
   seawater, would affect the mineralization process associated with coral
   calcification. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Adaptive signatures in thermal performance of the temperate coral
   <i>Astrangia poculata</i>},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {222},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Variation in environmental characteristics and divergent selection
   pressures can drive adaptive differentiation across a species' range.
   Astrangia poculata is a temperate scleractinian coral that provides
   unique opportunities to understand the roles of phenotypic plasticity
   and evolutionary adaptation in coral physiological tolerance limits.
   This species inhabits hard-bottom ecosystems from the northwestern
   Atlantic to the Gulf of Mexico and withstands an annual temperature
   range of up to 20 degrees C. Additionally, A. poculata is facultatively
   symbiotic and co-occurs in both symbiotic ('brown') and aposymbiotic
   ('white') states. Here, brown and white A. poculata were collected from
   Virginia (VA) and Rhode Island (RI), USA, and exposed to heat (18-32
   degrees C) and cold (18-6 degrees C) stress, during which respiration of
   the coral host along with photosynthesis and photochemical efficiency
   (F-v/F-m) of Breviolum psygmophilum photosymbionts were measured.
   Thermal performance curves (TPCs) of respiration revealed a pattern of
   countergradient variation with RI corals exhibiting higher respiration
   rates overall, and specifically at 6, 15, 18, 22 and 26 degrees C.
   Additionally, thermal optimum (T-opt) analyses show a 3.8 degrees C
   (brown) and 6.9 degrees C (white) higher T-opt in the VA population,
   corresponding to the warmer in situ thermal environment in VA. In
   contrast to respiration, no origin effect was detected in photosynthesis
   rates or F-v/F-m, suggesting a possible host-only signature of
   adaptation. This study is the first to consider A. poculata's response
   to both heat and cold stress across symbiotic states and geography, and
   provides insight into the potential evolutionary mechanisms behind the
   success of this species along the East Coast of the USA.},

Abstract = {Climate change-induced global warming threatens the survival of key
   ecosystems including shallow water coral reefs. Elevated temperatures
   can disrupt the normal physiological functioning of photosynthetic
   organisms by altering the fluidity and permeability of chloroplast
   membranes that is defined and regulated by their lipid composition.
   Since the habitat-forming reef corals rely on the obligatory symbiosis
   with dinoflagellates of the family Symbiodiniaceae, their heat stress
   response can be expected to be strongly influenced by the symbiont's
   lipid metabolism. However, in contrast to the steady increase in the
   knowledge of the functioning of coral symbionts at the genomic and
   transcriptomic level, the understanding of their membrane lipid
   composition and regulation in response to temperature stress is lagging
   behind. We have utilised mass spectrometry-based lipidomic analyses to
   identify the key polar lipids that form the biological membranes of reef
   coral symbionts, comparing the thermotolerant species Durusdinium
   trenchii with the thermosensitive taxon Cladocopium C3, both hosted by
   Acropora valida. Our results indicate that the superior thermotolerance
   D. trenchii inside the host corals could be achieved through (1) the
   amount and saturation of sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerols, in particular
   through putative photosystem II interactions, (2) the increased
   digalactosyldiacylglycerol to monogalactosyldiacylglycerol ratio with
   the potential to stabilise thylakoid membranes and integrated proteins,

   ecosystems to respond and adjust to heat stress events that are becoming
   more frequent due to climate change. Finally, our identification of

Title = {The ``Flexi-Chamber{''}: A Novel Cost-Effective <i>In Situ</i>
   Respirometry Chamber for Coral Physiological Measurements},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 8},
Abstract = {Coral reefs are threatened worldwide, with environmental stressors
   increasingly affecting the ability of reef-building corals to sustain
   growth from calcification (G), photosynthesis (P) and respiration (R).
   These processes support the foundation of coral reefs by directly
   influencing biogeochemical nutrient cycles and complex ecological
   interactions and therefore represent key knowledge required for
   effective reef management. However, metabolic rates are not trivial to
   quantify and typically rely on the use of cumbersome in situ
   respirometry chambers and/or the need to remove material and examine ex
   situ, thereby fundamentally limiting the scale, resolution and possibly
   the accuracy of the rate data. Here we describe a novel low-cost in situ
   respirometry bag that mitigates many constraints of traditional glass
   and plexi-glass incubation chambers. We subsequently demonstrate the
   effectiveness of our novel ``Flexi-Chamber{''} approach via two case
   studies: 1) the Flexi-Chamber provides values of P, R and G for the
   reef-building coral Siderastrea cf. stellata collected from reefs close
   to Salvador, Brazil, which were statistically similar to values
   collected from a traditional glass respirometry vessel; and 2)
   wide-scale application of obtaining P, R and G rates for different
   species across different habitats to obtain inter- and intra-species
   differences. Our novel cost-effective design allows us to increase
   sampling scale of metabolic rate measurements in situ without the need
   for destructive sampling and thus significantly expands on existing
   research potential, not only for corals as we have demonstrated here,
   but also other important benthic groups.},

Title = {Paradise lost: End-of-century warming and acidification under

   corals},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {26},

Abstract = {Despite recent efforts to curtail greenhouse gas emissions, current
   global emission trajectories are still following the business-as-usual
   representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 emission pathway. The
   resulting ocean warming and acidification have transformative impacts on
   coral reef ecosystems, detrimentally affecting coral physiology and
   health, and these impacts are predicted to worsen in the near future. In
   this study, we kept fragments of the symbiotic corals Acropora
   intermedia (thermally sensitive) and Porites lobata (thermally tolerant)
   for 7 weeks under an orthogonal design of predicted end-of-century
   RCP8.5 conditions for temperature and pCO(2) (3.5 degrees C and 570 ppm
   above present-day, respectively) to unravel how temperature and
   acidification, individually or interactively, influence metabolic and
   physiological performance. Our results pinpoint thermal stress as the
   dominant driver of deteriorating health in both species because of its
   propensity to destabilize coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis (bleaching).
   Acidification had no influence on metabolism but had a significant
   negative effect on skeleton growth, particularly when photosynthesis was
   absent such as in bleached corals or under dark conditions. Total loss
   of photosynthesis after bleaching caused an exhaustion of protein and
   lipid stores and collapse of calcification that ultimately led to A.
   intermedia mortality. Despite complete loss of symbionts from its
   tissue, P. lobata maintained small amounts of photosynthesis and
   experienced a weaker decline in lipid and protein reserves that
   presumably contributed to higher survival of this species. Our results
   indicate that ocean warming and acidification under business-as-usual
   CO2 emission scenarios will likely extirpate thermally sensitive coral
   species before the end of the century, while slowing the recovery of
   more thermally tolerant species from increasingly severe mass coral
   bleaching and mortality. This could ultimately lead to the gradual
   disappearance of tropical coral reefs globally, and a shift on surviving
   reefs to only the most resilient coral species.},

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {284},
Pages = {133-145},
Abstract = {Explants of the hard coral Seriatopora hystrix were exposed to sublethal
   concentrations of the herbicide diuron DCMU
   (N'-(3,4-dichlorophenyl,-N,N-dimethylurea)) and the heavy metal copper.
   Pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) chlorophyll fluorescence techniques were
   used to assess the effects on the photosynthetic efficiency of the algal
   symbionts in the tissue (in Symbio), and chlorophyll fluorescence and
   counts of symbiotic algae (normalised to surface area) were used to
   assess the extent of coral bleaching. At 30 mug DCMU l(-1), there was a
   reduction in both the maximum effective quantum yield (DeltaF/F-m') and
   maximum potential quantum yield (F-v/F-m) of the algal symbionts in
   symbio. Corals subsequently lost their algal symbionts and discoloured
   (bleached), especially on their upper sunlight-exposed surfaces. At the
   same DCMU concentration but under low light (5\% of growth irradiance),
   there was a marked reduction in DeltaF/F-m' but only a slight reduction
   in F-v/F-m and slight loss of algae. Loss of algal symbionts was also
   noted after a 7 d exposure to concentrations as low as 10 mug DCMU l(-1)
   under normal growth irradiance, and after 14 d exposure to 10 mug DCMU
   l(-1) under reduced irradiance. Collectively the results indicate that
   DCMU-induced bleaching is caused by a light-dependent photoinactivation
   of algal symbionts, and that bleaching occurs when F-v/F-n, (measured 2
   h after sunset) is reduced to a value of less than or equal to 0.6.
   Elevated copper concentrations (60 mug Cu l(-1) for 10 h) also induced a
   rapid bleaching in S. hystrix but without affecting the quantum yield of
   the algae in symbio. Tests with isolated algae indicated that
   substantially higher concentrations (300 mug Cu l(-1) for 8 h) were
   needed to significantly reduce the quantum yield. Thus, copper-induced
   bleaching occurs without affecting the algal photosynthesis and may be
   related to effects on the host (animal). It is argued that warm-water
   bleaching of corals resembles both types of chemically induced
   bleaching, suggesting the need for an integrated model of coral
   bleaching involving the effect of temperature on both host (coral) and
   algal symbionts.},

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {220},
Pages = {153-162},
Abstract = {Temperature, light and aragonite saturation state of seawater are
   important determinants of the global distribution of coral reefs.
   Saturation state of surface seawater is decreasing in response to
   increases in atmospheric PCO2, causing concern for a global reduction in
   the rates of reef accretion. In this study we address the influences of
   light and saturation state on skeletal growth of the hermatypic coral
   Porites compressa. We conducted 2 experiments using coral nubbins; one
   in a controlled laboratory with Biosphere 2 ocean water and the other in
   the 711 m(2) Biosphere 2 ocean itself, The laboratory experiment
   consisted of 3 light treatments (PAR = 698, 150, 81 mu mol photons m(-2)
   s(-1)) and 2 chemical treatments (pCO(2) = 199 mu atm, Omega = 5.05,
   CO32- = 355 mu mol kg(-1); and pCO(2) = 448 mu atm, Omega = 2.48, CO32-
   = 183 mu mol kg(-1)). In the Biosphere 2 ocean, coral nubbins were
   deployed at 4 depths (6, 4, 2 and 0.5 m) which, corresponded to
   different light conditions (PAR from 2.7 to 29.5 mol photons m(-2)
   d(-1)) during 3 different chemical states, mimicking the conditions of
   the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the present day and the year 2100
   (Y2100). Calcification rate changed with light following the typical
   hyperbolic tangent function. Calcification rate was positively
   correlated with saturation state, which ranged from 5 (LGM) to 2.4
   (Y2100), From the glacial experimental conditions (Omega = 5.05, pCO(2)
   = 186) to those of the future (Omega = 2.25, pCO(2) = 641),
   calcification dropped by 30\%; from present day conditions (Omega =
   3.64, pCO(2) = 336) to those of the future, calcification dropped by
   11\%. This decrease in calcification rate occurred at all light levels,
   indicating that rising CO2 will impact corals living at all depths.},

Title = {Caribbean scleractinian corals exhibit highly variable tolerances to
   acute hypoxia},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAY 17},
Abstract = {IntroductionClimate change, and the increase in sea surface temperature,
   is exacerbating ocean deoxygenation because of the inherent property of
   seawater to sequester less dissolved gas, such as oxygen, at warmer
   temperatures. While most coral reef studies focus on the effects of
   thermal stress and ocean acidification, few studies acknowledge the
   threat of hypoxia. Hypoxia is traditionally defined as 6.3 kPa (2 mg L-1
   O2), however, a universal hypoxia threshold is not useful given the vast
   range of responses among marine organisms. The range of metabolic
   responses and tolerances to hypoxia are unknown for Caribbean coral
   species and their algal symbionts. ObjectiveHere, we quantified the
   spectrum of acute hypoxia tolerances and the range of metabolic
   responses of six ecologically and structurally important Caribbean coral
   species (Acropora cervicornis, Siderastrea radians, Siderastrea siderea,
   Porites astreoides, Porites porites, and Orbicella faveolata) and their
   algal symbionts (Symbiodinium, Breviolum, and Durusdinium spp.).
   MethodsA total of 24 coral fragments (4 individuals per species) were
   exposed to 10 distinct oxygen concentrations ranging from normoxia
   (20.38 kPa) to severe hypoxia (3.3 kPa). We used intermittent flow
   respirometry to measure coral host respiration in the dark and algal
   symbiont photosynthesis in the light at each oxygen level. We determined
   a line of best fit for the metabolic rate vs. PO2 data and calculated
   the critical oxygen partial pressure (PO2 crit), a method that has not
   been tested on symbiotic species. ResultsCoral species and their algal
   symbionts measured here displayed a wide range of hypoxia tolerances.
   For the coral hosts, PO2 crit values differed roughly two-fold ranging
   from 5.74 kPa to 16.93 kPa, and for the algal symbionts, PO2 crit values
   differed roughly three-fold ranging from 3.9 kPa to 11.3 kPa.
   DiscussionThese results should be regarded as a first step to
   characterizing the metabolic response and acute tolerance of multiple
   coral hosts and algal symbionts to a wide range of oxygen
   concentrations. Given that some PO2 crit values were above the generally
   accepted hypoxia threshold, these results have implications for the
   community composition of reefs under a rapidly changing climate and can
   guide purposeful reef restoration.},

Abstract = {Increasing levels of greenhouse gases lead to ocean warming, which
   affects a range of marine organisms. Corals live in a narrow temperature
   range and become stressed when the temperatures change. Bleaching occurs
   when the temperature exceeds the coral's threshold, and can be severe
   when this is combined with other stressors such as light. In order to
   understand how temperature and light affect corals in their
   physiological responses and photosynthetic performance, Pocillopora
   acuta from Maiton Island (MT) and Panwa Cape (PW), representing
   different environments, were investigated. The results show that light
   and temperature had by regime different effects on Symbiodiniaceae
   photosynthesis and the coral growth rate. There was a synergistic effect
   of elevated temperature and light on photosynthesis, as observed in the
   photochemical efficiency and pigment contents, suggesting photo-damage.
   A higher growth rate in Panwa corals was observed in control, and while
   elevated temperature reduced coral growth. Elevated temperature affected
   the Panwa coral less, suggesting that corals from this regime might be
   able to recover when the temperature returns to normal. This information
   is important for predicting the coral responses to elevated temperature
   especially in the summer, as regards the possibility of coral bleaching.},

Title = {Impacts of Warming and Acidification on Coral Calcification Linked to
   Photosymbiont Loss and Deregulation of Calcifying Fluid pH},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Corals are globally important calcifiers that exhibit complex responses
   to anthropogenic warming and acidification. Although coral calcification
   is supported by high seawater pH, photosynthesis by the algal symbionts
   of zooxanthellate corals can be promoted by elevated pCO(2). To
   investigate the mechanisms underlying corals' complex responses to
   global change, three species of tropical zooxanthellate corals
   (Stylophora pistillata, Pocillopora damicornis, and Seriatopora hystrix)
   and one species of asymbiotic cold-water coral (Desmophyllum pertusum,
   syn. Lophelia pertusa) were cultured under a range of ocean
   acidification and warming scenarios. Under control temperatures, all
   tropical species exhibited increased calcification rates in response to
   increasing pCO(2). However, the tropical species' response to increasing
   pCO(2) flattened when they lost symbionts (i.e., bleached) under the
   high-temperature treatments-suggesting that the loss of symbionts
   neutralized the benefit of increased pCO(2) on calcification rate.
   Notably, the cold-water species that lacks symbionts exhibited a
   negative calcification response to increasing pCO(2), although this
   negative response was partially ameliorated under elevated temperature.
   All four species elevated their calcifying fluid pH relative to seawater
   pH under all pCO(2) treatments, and the magnitude of this offset
   (Delta{[}H+]) increased with increasing pCO(2). Furthermore, calcifying
   fluid pH decreased along with symbiont abundance under thermal stress
   for the one species in which calcifying fluid pH was measured under both
   temperature treatments. This observation suggests a mechanistic link
   between photosymbiont loss ('bleaching') and impairment of
   zooxanthellate corals' ability to elevate calcifying fluid pH in support
   of calcification under heat stress. This study supports the assertion
   that thermally induced loss of photosymbionts impairs tropical
   zooxanthellate corals' ability to cope with CO2-induced ocean
   acidification.},

Title = {Thermal responses of <i>Symbiodinium</i> photosynthetic carbon
   assimilation},

Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {501-512},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The symbiosis between hermatypic corals and their dinoflagellate
   endosymbionts, genus Symbiodinium, is based on carbon exchange. This
   symbiosis is disrupted by thermally induced coral bleaching, a stress
   response in which the coral host expels its algal symbionts as they
   become physiologically impaired. The disruption of the dissolved
   inorganic carbon (DIC) supply or the thermal inactivation of Rubisco
   have been proposed as sites of initial thermal damage that leads to the
   bleaching response. Symbiodinium possesses a highly unusual Form II
   ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), which exhibits a
   lower CO2:O-2 specificity and may be more thermally unstable than the
   Form I Rubiscos of other algae and land plants. Components of the CO2
   concentrating mechanism (CCM), which supplies inorganic carbon for
   photosynthesis, may also be temperature sensitive. Here, we examine the
   ability of four cultured Symbiodinium strains to acquire and fix DIC
   across a temperature gradient. Surprisingly, the half-saturation
   constant of photosynthesis with respect to DIC concentration (K (P)), an
   index of CCM function, declined with increasing temperature in three of
   the four strains, indicating a greater potential for photosynthetic
   carbon acquisition at elevated temperatures. In the fourth strain, there
   was no effect of temperature on K (P). Finding no evidence for thermal
   inhibition of the CCM, we conclude that CCM components are not likely to
   be the primary sites of thermal damage. Reduced photosynthetic quantum
   yields, a hallmark of thermal bleaching, were observed at low DIC
   concentrations, leaving open the possibility that reduced inorganic
   carbon availability is involved in bleaching.},

Title = {Effects of hypo-osmosis on the coral <i>Stylophora pistillata</i>::
   nature and cause of `low-salinity bleaching'},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {253},
Pages = {145-154},
Abstract = {The response of the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata to
   short-term (min to h) and long-term (d) exposure to reduced-salinity
   seawater was examined. Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) chlorophyll
   fluorescence techniques were used to assess the photosynthetic
   efficiency of the symbiotic dinoflagellates (dark-adapted F-v/F-m) in
   the coral tissues (in hospite) before, during and after exposure.
   Exposure to reduced-salinity seawater caused a marked reduction in
   efficiency (the ratio of variable {[}F-v] to maximal {[}F-m]
   fluorescence), and there was an apparent link between a reduction in
   dark-adapted F-v/F-m and a loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates from the
   corals. The reduction in F-v/F-m of the symbiotic algae and subsequent
   dissociation of the coral-algal symbiosis (coral bleaching) occurred
   during exposure to reduced-salinity seawater in either the light or
   dark. The results demonstrate that bleaching in response to low-salinity
   seawater is a truly sublethal response, contrary to a recent suggestion.
   The study also suggests that bleaching of corals in response to
   low-salinity seawater may not involve the passive loss of algal
   symbionts and that an impairment of the capacity of the algal symbionts
   for photosynthesis represents a common `cue' initiating the dissociation
   of the coral-algal symbiosis during exposure to sub-optimal conditions.
   This study demonstrates how exposure to low-salinity seawater alone can
   cause some of the symptoms commonly attributed to temperature anomalies
   and anthropogenic pressures on coral reefs.},

Title = {Photosynthetic response of Persian Gulf acroporid corals to summer
   versus winter temperature deviations},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {With on-going climate change, coral susceptibility to thermal stress
   constitutes a central concern in reefconservation. In the Persian Gulf,
   coral reefs are confronted with a high seasonal variability in water
   temperature, and both hot and cold extremes have been associated with
   episodes of coral bleaching and mortality. Using physiological
   performance as a measure of coral health, we investigated the thermal
   susceptibility of the common acroporid, Acropora downingi, near Hengam
   Island where the temperature oscillates seasonally in the range
   20.2-34.2 degrees C. In a series of two short-term experiments comparing
   coral response in summer versus winter conditions, we exposed corals
   during each season (1) to the corresponding seasonal average and extreme
   temperature levels in a static thermal environment, and (2) to a
   progressive temperature deviation from the annual mean toward the
   corresponding extreme seasonal value and beyond in a dynamic thermal
   environment. We monitored four indictors of coral physiological
   performance: net photosynthesis (Pn), dark respiration (R), autotrophic
   capability (Pn/R), and survival. Corals exposed to warming during summer
   showed a decrease in net photosynthesis and ultimately died, while
   corals exposed to cooling during winter were not affected in their
   photosynthetic performance and survival. Coral autotrophic capability
   Pn/R was lower at the warmer thermal level within eachseason, and during
   summer compared to winter. Corals exposed to the maximum temperature of
   summer displayed Pn/R < 1, inferring that photosynthetic performance
   could not support basal metabolic needs under this environment. Our
   results suggest that the autotrophic performance of the Persian Gulf A.
   downingi is sensitive to the extreme temperatures endured in summer, and
   therefore its populations may be impacted by future increases in water
   temperature.},

Title = {Comparative thermal performance of the reef-building coral <i>Orbicella
   franksi</i> at its latitudinal range limits},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {166},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Temperature drives biological responses that scale from the cellular to
   ecosystem levels and thermal sensitivity will shape organismal functions
   and population dynamics as the world warms. Reef-building corals are
   sensitive to temperature due to their endosymbiotic relationship with
   single-celled dinoflagellates, with mass mortality events increasing in
   frequency and magnitude. The purpose of this study was to quantify the
   thermal sensitivity of important physiological functions of a Caribbean
   reef-building coral, Orbicella franksi, through the measurement of
   thermal performance curves (TPCs). We compared TPC metrics (thermal
   optimum, critical maximum, activation energy, deactivation energy, and
   rate at a standardized temperature) between two populations at the
   northern and southern extents of the geographic range of O. franksi. We
   further compared essential coral organismal processes (gross
   photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification) within a site to
   determine which function is most sensitive to thermal stress using a
   hierarchical Bayesian-modeling approach. We found evidence for
   differences in thermal performance, which could be due to thermal
   adaptation or acclimatization, with higher TPC metrics (thermal optimum
   and critical maximum) in warmer Panama, compared to cooler Bermuda. We
   also documented the hierarchy in thermal sensitivity of essential
   organismal functions within a population: respiration was less sensitive
   than photosynthesis, which was less sensitive than calcification.
   Understanding thermal performance of corals is essential for projecting
   coral reef futures, given that key biological functions necessary to
   sustain coral reef ecosystems are thermally mediated.},

Abstract = {Ultrastructural changes in the coral tissues and symbiotic zooxanthellae
   of the scleractinian coral, Pocillopora damicornis, after exposure to
   high temperature (HT), ultraviolet (UV) and far-red (FR) radiation were
   examined by transmission electron microscopy. In normal environmental
   conditions, the coral gastrodermis contained zero to two zooxanthellae
   and maintained well-defined cortical and intracellular structures. When
   corals were exposed to HT, UV and FR, the gastrodermal features changed
   remarkably depending on the duration of exposure. Treatment with HT for
   15 min or exposure to UV and FR for 6 h induced the appearance of
   numerous, small, electron-dense granules in the gastrodermis.
   Autophagosomes and lysosomes in the gastrodermal cells also increased in
   number. The gastrodermal cells containing no zooxanthellae began to
   degrade and became vacuolated through the destruction and fragmentation
   of their cytoplasmic contents. Prolonged exposure to these stressors
   brought about the disintegration of the cells without zooxanthellae and
   led to the collapse of the gastrodermis. This resulted in the release of
   the other gastrodermal cells containing zooxanthellae from the
   gastrodermis to gastrovascular cavities. HT, UV and FR affected the
   gastrodermal cells without zooxanthellae more severely than the
   zooxanthellae themselves, although the thylakoids of the zooxanthellae
   were often destroyed when the coral was exposed to UV and FR. These
   results suggest that the coral receives the distinct stressors, HT, UV
   and FR, but has a common mechanism that promotes autolysis activities in
   the gastrodermis and discharges cells containing zooxanthellae.},

Title = {The relationship between heterotrophic feeding and inorganic nutrient

Abstract = {Worldwide increase in seawater temperature represents one of the major
   threats affecting corals, which experience bleaching, and thereafter a
   significant decrease in photosynthesis and calcification. The impact of
   bleaching on coral physiology may be exacerbated when coupled with
   eutrophication, i.e., increasing plankton, inorganic nutrient
   concentrations, sedimentation and turbidity due to coastal urbanization.
   Whereas zooplankton provision (heterotrophy) may alleviate the negative
   consequences of thermal stress, inorganic nutrient supply may exacerbate
   them, which creates a paradox. Our experimental study aims to
   disentangle the effects of these two components of eutrophication on the
   physiological response of Turbinaria reniformis subject to normal and to
   a short-term temperature increase. Additionally, three different
   inorganic nutrient ratios were tested to assess the influence of
   nutrient stoichiometry on coral physiology: control (ambient SW 0.5 mu M
   N and 0.1 mu M P), N only (ambient + 2 mu M N) and N+P (ambient + 2 mu M
   N and + 0.5 mu M P). Our results show a deleterious effect of a 2 mu M
   nitrate enrichment alone (N) on coral photosynthetic processes under
   thermal stress as well as on calcification rates when associated with
   heterotrophy. On the contrary, a coupled nitrate and phosphorus
   enrichment (N+P) maintained coral metabolism and calcification during
   thermal stress and enhanced them when combined with heterotrophy.
   Broadly, our results shed light on the tight relationship existing
   between inorganic nutrient availability and heterotrophy. Moreover, it
   assesses the relevance of N: P stoichiometry as a determining factor for
   the health of the holobiont that may be adapted to specific nutrient
   ratios in its surrounding environment.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2013},

Abstract = {Efforts to evaluate the response of coral larvae to global climate
   change (GCC) and ocean acidification (OA) typically employ short
   experiments of fixed length, yet it is unknown how the response is
   affected by exposure duration. In this study, we exposed larvae from the
   brooding coral Pocillopora damicornis to contrasts of temperature (24.00
   degrees C {[}ambient] versus 30.49 degrees C) and pCO(2) (49.4 Pa versus
   862 Pa) for varying periods (1-5 days) to test the hypothesis that
   exposure duration had no effect on larval response as assessed by
   protein content, respiration, Symbiodinium density, and survivorship;
   exposure times were ecologically relevant compared to representative
   pelagic larval durations (PLO) for corals. Larvae differed among days
   for all response variables, and the effects of the treatment were
   relatively consistent regardless of exposure duration for three of the
   four response variables. Protein content and Symbiodinium density were
   unaffected by temperature and pCO(2), but respiration increased with
   temperature (but not pCO(2)) with the effect intensifying as incubations
   lengthened. Survival, however, differed significantly among treatments
   at the end of the study, and by the 5th day, 78\% of the larvae were
   alive and swimming under ambient temperature and ambient pCO(2), but
   only 55-59\% were alive in the other treatments. These results
   demonstrate that the physiological effects of temperature and pCO(2) on
   coral larvae can reliably be detected within days, but effects on
   survival require days to detect. The detection of time-dependent effects
   on larval survivorship suggests that the influence of GCC and OA will be
   stronger for corals having long PLDs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Oxygen Metabolic Responses of Three Species of Large Benthic
   Foraminifers with Algal Symbionts to Temperature Stress},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 3},
Abstract = {Water temperature affects the physiology of large benthic foraminifers
   (LBFs) with algal symbionts dwelling in coral reef environments.
   However, the detailed physiological responses of LBF holobionts to
   temperature ranges occurring in their habitats are not known. We report
   net oxygen (O-2) production and respiration rates of three LBF
   holobionts (Baculogypsina sphaerulata and Calcarina gaudichaudii hosting
   diatom symbionts, and Amphisorus kudakajimensis hosting dinoflagellate
   symbionts) measured in the laboratory at water temperatures ranging from
   5 degrees C to 45 degrees C in 2.5 degrees C or 5 degrees C intervals
   and with light saturation levels of similar to 500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1).
   In addition, the recovery of net O-2 production and respiration rates
   after exposure to temperature stress was assessed. The net O-2
   production and respiration rates of the three LBF holobionts peaked at
   similar to 30 degrees C, indicating their optimal temperature for a
   short exposure period. At extreme high temperatures (>= 40 degrees C),
   the net O-2 production rates of all three LBF holobionts declined to
   less than zero and the respiration rates slightly decreased, indicating
   that photosynthesis of algal symbionts was inactivated. At extreme low
   temperatures (<= 10 degrees C for two calcarinid species and <= 5
   degrees C for A. kudakajimensis), the net O-2 production and respiration
   rates were near zero, indicating a weakening of holobiont activity.
   After exposure to extreme high or low temperature, the net O-2
   production rates did not recover until the following day, whereas the
   respiration rates recovered rapidly, suggesting that a longer time
   (days) is required for recovery from damage to the photosystem by
   temperature stress compared to the respiration system. These results
   indicate that the oxygen metabolism of LBF holobionts can generally cope
   well with conditions that fluctuate diurnally and seasonally in their
   habitats. However, temporal heat and cold stresses with high light
   levels may induce severe damage to algal symbionts and also damage to
   host foraminifers.},

Title = {Effects of Light, Food Availability and Temperature Stress on the
   Function of Photosystem II and Photosystem I of Coral Symbionts},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 13},
Abstract = {Background: Reef corals are heterotrophic coelenterates that achieve
   high productivity through their photosynthetic dinoflagellate symbionts.
   Excessive seawater temperature destabilises this symbiosis and causes
   corals to ``bleach,{''} lowering their photosynthetic capacity.
   Bleaching poses a serious threat to the persistence of coral reefs on a
   global scale. Despite expanding research on the causes of bleaching, the
   mechanisms remain a subject of debate.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: This study determined how light and food
   availability modulate the effects of temperature stress on
   photosynthesis in two reef coral species. We quantified the activities
   of Photosystem II, Photosystem I and whole chain electron transport
   under combinations of normal and stressful growth temperatures, moderate
   and high light levels and the presence or absence of feeding of the
   coral hosts. Our results show that PS1 function is comparatively robust
   against temperature stress in both species, whereas PS2 and whole chain
   electron transport are susceptible to temperature stress. In the
   symbiotic dinoflagellates of Stylophora pistillata the contents of
   chlorophyll and major photosynthetic complexes were primarily affected
   by food availability. In Turbinaria reniformis growth temperature was
   the dominant influence on the contents of the photosynthetic complexes.
   In both species feeding the host significantly protected photosynthetic
   function from high temperature stress.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our findings support the photoinhibition model
   of coral bleaching and demonstrate that PS1 is not a major site for
   thermal damage during bleaching events. Feeding mitigates bleaching in
   two scleractinian corals, so that reef responses to temperature stresses
   will likely be influenced by the coinciding availabilities of prey for
   the host.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are currently experiencing substantial ecological
   impoverishment as a result of anthropogenic stressors, and the majority
   of reefs are facing immediate risk. Increasing ocean surface
   temperatures induce frequent coral mass bleaching events-the breakdown
   of the nutritional photo-symbiosis with intracellular algae (genus:
   Symbiodinium). Here, we report that Stylophora pistillata from a highly
   diverse reef in the Gulf of Aqaba showed no signs of bleaching despite
   spending 1.5 months at 1-2 degrees C above their long-term summer
   maximum (amounting to 11 degree heating weeks) and a seawater pH of 7.8.
   Instead, their symbiotic dinoflagellates exhibited improved
   photochemistry, higher pigmentation and a doubling in net oxygen
   production, leading to a 51\% increase in primary productivity.
   Nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry imaging revealed subtle
   cellular-level shifts in carbon and nitrogen metabolism under elevated
   temperatures, but overall host and symbiont biomass proxies were not
   significantly affected. Now living well below their thermal threshold in
   the Gulf of Aqaba, these corals have been evolutionarily selected for
   heat tolerance during their migration through the warm Southern Red Sea
   after the last ice age. This may allow them to withstand future warming
   for a longer period of time, provided that successful environmental
   conservation measures are enacted across national boundaries in the
   region.},

Abstract = {The global rise in sea surface temperatures causes regular exposure of
   corals to high temperature and high light stress, leading to worldwide
   disastrous coral bleaching events (loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates
   (Symbiodinium) from reef-building corals). Our picosecond chlorophyll
   fluorescence experiments on cultured Symbiodinium Glade C cells exposed
   to coral bleaching conditions uncovered the transformations of the
   alga's photosynthetic apparatus (PSA) that activate an extremely
   efficient non-photochemical ``super-quenching{''} mechanism. The
   mechanism is associated with a transition from an initially
   heterogeneous photosystem II (PSII) pool to a homogeneous
   ``spillover{''} pool, where nearly all excitation energy is transferred
   to photosystem I (PSI). There, the inherently higher stability of PSI
   and high quenching efficiency of P-700(+) allow dumping of PSII excess
   excitation energy into heat, resulting in almost complete cessation of
   photosynthetic electron transport (PET). This potentially reversible
   ``super-quenching{''} mechanism protects the PSA against destruction at
   the cost of a loss of photosynthetic activity. We suggest that the
   inhibition of PET and the consequent inhibition of organic carbon
   production (e.g. sugars) in the symbiotic Symbiodinium provide a trigger
   for the symbiont expulsion, i.e. bleaching. (C) 2016 Published by

Abstract = {Rising seawater temperature and ocean acidification threaten the
   survival of coral reefs. The relationship between coral physiology and
   its microbiome may reveal why some corals are more resilient to these
   global change conditions. Here, we conducted the first experiment to
   simultaneously investigate changes in the coral microbiome and coral
   physiology in response to the dual stress of elevated seawater
   temperature and ocean acidification expected by the end of this century.
   Two species of corals, Acropora millepora containing the thermally
   sensitive endosymbiont C21a and Turbinaria reniformis containing the
   thermally tolerant endosymbiont Symbiodinium trenchi, were exposed to
   control (26.5 degrees C and pCO(2) of 364 mu atm) and treatment (29.0
   degrees C and pCO(2) of 750 mu atm) conditions for 24 days, after which
   we measured the microbial community composition. These microbial
   findings were interpreted within the context of previously published
   physiological measurements from the exact same corals in this study
   (calcification, organic carbon flux, ratio of photosynthesis to
   respiration, photosystem II maximal efficiency, total lipids, soluble
   animal protein, soluble animal carbohydrates, soluble algal protein,
   soluble algal carbohydrate, biomass, endosymbiotic algal density, and
   chlorophyll a). Overall, dually stressed A. millepora had reduced
   microbial diversity, experienced large changes in microbial community
   composition, and experienced dramatic physiological declines in
   calcification, photosystem II maximal efficiency, and algal
   carbohydrates. In contrast, the dually stressed coral T. reniformis
   experienced a stable and more diverse microbiome community with minimal
   physiological decline, coupled with very high total energy reserves and
   particulate organic carbon release rates. Thus, the microbiome changed
   and microbial diversity decreased in the physiologically sensitive coral
   with the thermally sensitive endosymbiotic algae but not in the
   physiologically tolerant coral with the thermally tolerant endosymbiont.
   Our results confirm recent findings that temperature-stress tolerant
   corals have a more stable microbiome, and demonstrate for the first time
   that this is also the case under the dual stresses of ocean warming and
   acidification. We propose that coral with a stable microbiome are also
   more physiologically resilient and thus more likely to persist in the
   future, and shape the coral species diversity of future reef ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Compounded disturbances are becoming increasingly common on coral reefs.
   Impacts of global warming, which is generally perceived as the most
   serious threat to coral reefs today, often coincide with various common
   anthropogenic disturbances, such as pollution and overharvesting. To
   better evaluate the impact of global warming, interactions between
   elevated temperature and background disturbance should be investigated.
   In this study, the physiological response of the reef-building coral
   Porites cylindrica was investigated, when exposed to enrichment of
   dissolved inorganic nitrate (+ 15 muM for 14 days) and elevated seawater
   temperature ( + 2 C for 48 h), in the absence of particulate food. It
   was shown that P. cvlindrica was able to tolerate the temperature
   exposure without losing symbiotic microalgae or chlorophyll pigments,
   although the photosynthetic capacity was affected. Nitrate enrichment
   significantly reduced primary production rate, although zooxanthella
   population density and chlorophyll concentrations were not affected. The
   combination of elevated temperature and nitrate enrichment produced an
   even more pronounced reduction of the production rate. Since coral
   respiration rate remained unaffected by the treatments, this implies
   that the corals were unable to acclimate to impaired photosynthesis.
   However, there was no indication of subsequently reduced tissue growth
   or increased host catabolism based on tissue biomass measurements. On
   the other hand, all corals, including controls, lost tissue biomass
   during the exposure, suggesting a dependence on particulate food. Our
   results imply that corals on nutrient-exposed reefs may be more stressed
   during periods of elevated temperature, compared to corals in more
   pristine areas.},

Abstract = {The effects of temperature on two reef building corals Pocillopora
   damicornis and P. verrucosa inhabiting the Obhur Creek, a small
   embayment on the western, Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia, was studied
   from December 2009 to November 2010. The overall annual range of
   seawater temperature in Obhur Creek was between 24.5 degrees C and 33
   degrees C . Zooxanthellae abundance and diversity showed seasonal
   variations: the number of zooxanthellae in P. damicornis was slightly
   higher than in P. verrucosa, and the abundance of zooxanthellae of both
   species was low in summer and high during winter. The respiration rate
   of P. verrucosa did not vary between summer and winter, suggesting
   compensatory acclimation. In contrast, the respiratory rate in P.
   damicornis was lower in winter than in summer. During the winter season
   the metabolic rate was higher in both species owing to the optimum
   seawater temperature (30 degrees C). As a result of the abundance of
   zooxanthellae and the optimum seawater temperature, the growth rates of
   the skeletons of the two coral species were higher in winter and lower
   in summer. In general, the results showed that P. verrucosa is more
   flexible with respect to temperature than P. damicornis. The difference
   in zooxanthellae thermal tolerances at 35 degrees C may be due to the
   algal genotypes between the two species, resulting in P. damicornis
   becoming bleached as the rate of metabolism exceeds the rate of
   photosynthesis with increasing temperature.},

Title = {Tolerance of endolithic algae to elevated temperature and light in the

Abstract = {Photosynthetic endolithic algae and cyanobacteria live within the
   skeletons of many scleractinians. Under normal conditions, less than 5\%
   of the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) reaches the green
   endolithic algae because of the absorbance of light by the endosymbiotic
   dinoflagellates and the carbonate skeleton. When corals bleach (loose
   dinoflagellate symbionts), however, the tissue of the corals become
   highly transparent and photosynthetic microendoliths may be exposed to
   high levels of both thermal and solar stress. This study explores the
   consequence of these combined stresses on the phototrophic endoliths
   inhabiting the skeleton of Montipora monasteriata, growing at Heron
   Island, on the southern Great Barrier Reef. Endoliths that were exposed
   to sun after tissue removal were by far more susceptible to thermal
   photoinhibition and photo-damage than endoliths under coral tissue that
   contained high concentrations of brown dinoflagellate symbionts. While
   temperature or light alone did not result in decreased photosynthetic
   efficiency of the endoliths, combined thermal and solar stress caused a
   major decrease and delayed recovery. Endoliths protected under intact
   tissue recovered rapidly and photoacclimated soon after exposure to
   elevated sea temperatures. Endoliths under naturally occurring bleached
   tissue of M. monasteriata colonies (bleaching event in March 2004 at
   Heron Island) acclimated to increased irradiance as the brown symbionts
   disappeared. We suggest that two major factors determine the outcome of
   thermal bleaching to the endolith community. The first is the
   microhabitat and light levels under which a coral grows, and the second
   is the susceptibility of the coral-dinoflagellates symbiosis to thermal
   stress. More resistant corals may take longer to bleach allowing
   endoliths time to acclimate to a new light environment. This in turn may
   have implications for coral survival.},

Title = {Symbiosis and host morphological variation: Symbiodiniaceae
   photosynthesis in the octocoral <i>Briareum asbestinum</i> at ambient
   and elevated temperatures},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {38},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Intra-species morphological variation may occur in sessile organisms,
   such as corals, living in different habitats. Conversely, the octocoral
   Briareum asbestinum exhibits both encrusting and upright branching
   morphologies at the same shallow water habitat, enabling studying
   physiological differences uncoupled from habitat variation due to depth
   or reef location. We investigated the mutualism between endosymbiotic
   dinoflagellate algae, Breviolum spp. (previously clade B Symbiodinium),
   and these B. asbestinum morphologies at ambient and elevated
   temperatures. Based on msh1 gene sequences, the host morphologies were
   genetically similar although they differed in protein content, polyp
   expansion behavior, and associated Breviolum (B19 for encrusting and B21
   for branching B. asbestinum). Due to colony orientation, polyps in
   encrusting B. asbestinum experienced irradiance levels nearly three
   times higher than polyps in the branching morph, which probably
   contributed to the lower photochemical and light absorption efficiencies
   of the Breviolum in encrusting fragments. The light-limited portion of
   photosynthesis-irradiance curves and the intracellular chlorophyll
   concentrations, however, indicated that Breviolum in both morphologies
   were acclimated to similar internal irradiances. Encrusting B.
   asbestinum exhibited higher Breviolum density, areal chlorophyll a, and
   greater photosynthetic rates cm(-2) compared to branching B. asbestinum.
   Notably, elevated temperature did not cause bleaching in either
   morphology, as Breviolum and chlorophyll densities did not differ
   significantly from ambient temperature, although the two morphologies
   adjusted some of the measured parameters, indicating coping with the
   stressor. In the face of continued ocean warming, the high thermal
   tolerance of octocorals may reinforce the shift of Caribbean reefs from
   scleractinian coral to octocoral dominance.},

Title = {Is photoinhibition of zooxanthellae photosynthesis the primary cause of
   thermal bleaching in corals?},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The bleaching of corals in response to increases in temperature has
   resulted in significant coral reef degradation in many tropical marine
   ecosystems. This bleaching has frequently been attributed to
   photoinhibition of photosynthetic electron transport and the consequent
   photodamage to photosystem II (PSII) and the production of damaging
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the zooxanthellae (Symbiodinium spp.).
   However, these events may be because of perturbations of other processes
   occurring within the zooxanthellae or the host cells, and consequently
   constitute only secondary responses to temperature increase. The
   processes involved with the onset of photoinhibition of electron
   transport, photodamage to PSII and pigment bleaching in coral
   zooxanthellae are reviewed. Consideration is given to how increases in
   temperature might lead to perturbations of metabolic processes in the
   zooxanthellae and/or their host cells, which could trigger events
   leading to bleaching. It is concluded that production of ROS by the
   thylakoid photosynthetic apparatus in the zooxanthellae plays a major
   role in the onset of bleaching resulting from photoinhibition of
   photosynthesis, although it is not clear which particular ROS are
   involved. It is suggested that hydrogen peroxide generated in the
   zooxanthellae may have a signalling role in triggering the mechanisms
   that result in expulsion of zooxanthellae from corals.},

Title = {Photoacclimation dynamics in coral holobionts responding to thermal and
   irradiance changes correlate with photon pressure per symbiont},
Journal = {LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 11},
Abstract = {Photoacclimation is a key homeostatic process that enables
   photosymbiotic reef corals to flourish within highly variable light
   environments. However, the temporal dynamics of photoacclimation remain
   poorly characterized. We studied photoacclimation at several time points
   over 24 d in two scleractinian coral taxa (mounding Porites spp. and
   branching Acropora muricata). Coral specimens preacclimated at 24
   degrees C and 171 mu mol quanta m-2 s-1 were exposed to three light
   levels (-32\%, +27\%, and +65\% relative to that of the acclimation
   period) at two temperatures (control, 24 degrees C; mildly stressful, 29
   degrees C). Intra-tissue light environment-specifically, photon pressure
   per symbiont-increased dramatically with each additional light dose and
   again with increasing temperature in Porites spp.; net photosynthesis
   (Pnet) rates continued to change for at least 2 weeks following light
   increase but not light reduction, and vice versa for symbiont densities.
   Intra-tissue light environments were substantially dimmer and more
   homogeneous among all light treatments in A. muricata, which continued
   to increase its light-use efficiency and Pnet through time in most or
   all treatments. Consequently, prolonged change in Fv/Fm at elevated
   temperature in Porites spp. but not A. muricata may have been caused by
   differing photodamage loads. Moderation of light levels by conditions
   within the coral tissue seems to affect the temporal dynamics of the
   photoacclimation response, and this finding emphasizes new avenues for
   photoacclimation research.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAR 16},
Abstract = {Mass coral bleaching compromises the long-term persistence of coral
   reefs, yet our current understanding of the different cellular
   mechanisms leading to the development of a bleached coral is still
   limited. In this perspective, we mapped the cascade of cellular events
   and physiological responses of symbiotic corals triggered by thermal
   stress. Based on existing knowledge, we created an integrated model that
   describes phenotypic changes induced by sensing mechanisms. Cellular
   responses are mapped in the context of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
   production in the algal symbiont chloroplast, followed by signaling to
   the nucleus and subsequent ``leak{''} to the coral host cell. The
   starting point is set by ROS production and signaling, which is a
   day-to-day mechanism by which symbiotic corals maintain homeostasis and
   acclimate to environmental variation. As stress and acclimation are
   intimately linked, our model maps coral responses from the initial
   stimulus in the chloroplast to the complex cascade of events leading to
   seasonal phenotypic changes (i.e., seasonal acclimation), and if stress
   progresses, to the downstream coral bleached phenotype (i.e., when the
   coral's capacity to acclimate is overwhelmed by heat stress). Placing
   acclimation, heat stress and bleaching responses in a common ground is a
   critical step to reduce the source of uncertainty in understanding the
   coral response to climate change, fundamental for the development of
   predictive climate models.},

   damicornis</i>},
Journal = {METABOLOMICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Introduction As a changing climate threatens the persistence of
   terrestrial and marine ecosystems by altering community composition and
   function, differential performance of taxa highlights the need for
   predictive metrics and mechanistic understanding of the factors
   underlying positive performance in the face of environmental
   disturbances. Biochemical reactions within cells provide a snapshot of
   molecular regulation and flexibility during exposure to environmental
   stressors. However, because the organism is the unit of selection there
   is a need for the integration of metabolite data with organism
   physiology to understand mechanisms responsible for individual success
   under a changing climate.
   Objectives Our study aims to characterize the molecular response of reef
   corals to simulated global climate change stressors. Furthermore, we
   seek to relate changes in the molecular physiology to observations in
   overall colony response.
   Methods To this end, we applied a non-targeted metabolomic approach to
   describe lipid and primary metabolite composition after exposure of the
   reef-building coral Pocillopora damicornis to ambient and elevated
   experimental climate change conditions. We compared these metabolite
   data to organism physiology, specifically the key processes of
   photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification.
   Results Corals significantly altered their lipid and primary metabolite
   profiles in response to experimental treatments. Primary metabolite
   profiles predicted organisms' net photosynthesis, but not calcification
   or respiration measures. Despite challenges in metabolome annotation,
   our data indicated corals alter carbohydrate composition, cell
   structural lipids, and signaling compounds in response to elevated
   treatment conditions.
   Conclusions The integration of metabolite and physiological data
   highlights the predictive power of metabolomics in defining organism
   performance and provides biomarkers for future studies. Here, we present
   a multivariate biomarker approach to assess climate change impacts and
   advance our mechanistic understanding of stress response in this
   keystone species.},

Title = {Food availability promotes rapid recovery from thermal stress in a

Abstract = {Bleaching in corals due to environmental stress represents a loss of
   energy intake often leading to an increase in mortality risk. Successful
   coral recovery from severe bleaching events may depend on the rate of
   replenishment of algal symbiont populations following the period of
   thermal stress, the supply of an alternative food source, or both. Here,
   we explore the role of food availability in promoting the survival and
   recovery of a common coral (Acropora intermedia) following acute
   experimentally induced thermal stress. Fed corals were provided with
   live rotifers daily, to maintain densities of zooplankton in tanks that
   are typical of coral reefs. After a 6-week acclimation phase, heated
   corals were subjected to a +4 A degrees C thermal anomaly for a 7-day
   period (bleaching phase) then temperatures were returned to normal for a
   further 2 weeks (recovery phase). Results demonstrated that heated
   corals had higher survival when they were provided with heterotrophic
   food. Fed corals experienced reduced loss of chlorophyll a, relative to
   unfed corals. During the recovery phase, both fed and unfed corals
   recovered within a few days; however, fed corals recovered to
   pre-bleaching phase levels of chlorophyll a, whereas unfed corals
   stabilized approximately one-third below this level. Protein levels of
   fed corals declined markedly during the bleaching phase, but recovered
   all of their losses by the end of the recovery phase. In contrast, unfed
   corals had low protein levels that were maintained throughout the
   experiment. To the extent that these results are representative of
   corals' responses to thermal anomalies in nature, the findings imply
   that availability of particulate food matter has the potential to
   increase corals' capacity to survive thermally induced bleaching and to
   ameliorate its sub-lethal effects. They also support the hypothesis that
   different rates of heterotrophy are an important determinant of
   variation in resilience to thermal stress among reef environments.},

Title = {A dynamic bioenergetic model for coral-<i>Symbiodinium</i> symbioses and
   coral bleaching as an alternate stable state},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {431},
Pages = {49-62},
Month = {OCT 27},
Abstract = {Coral reef ecosystems owe their ecological success - and vulnerability
   to climate change - to the symbiotic metabolism of corals and
   Symbiodinium spp. The urgency to understand and predict the stability
   and breakdown of these symbioses (i.e., coral `bleaching') demands the
   development and application of theoretical tools. Here, we develop a
   dynamic bioenergetic model of coral-Symbiodinium symbioses that
   demonstrates realistic steady-state patterns in coral growth and
   symbiont abundance across gradients of light, nutrients, and feeding.
   Furthermore, by including a mechanistic treatment of photo-oxidative
   stress, the model displays dynamics of bleaching and recovery that can
   be explained as transitions between alternate stable states. These
   dynamics reveal that ``healthy{''} and ``bleached{''} states correspond
   broadly to nitrogen- and carbon-limitation in the system, with
   transitions between them occurring as integrated responses to multiple
   environmental factors. Indeed, a suite of complex emergent behaviors
   reproduced by the model (e.g., bleaching is exacerbated by nutrients and
   attenuated by feeding) suggests it captures many important attributes of
   the system; meanwhile, its modular framework and open source R code are
   designed to facilitate further problem-specific development. We see
   significant potential for this modeling framework to generate testable
   hypotheses and predict integrated, mechanistic responses of corals to
   environmental change, with important implications for understanding the
   performance and maintenance of symbiotic systems. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2002},

Abstract = {The effect of feeding on the carbon isotopic composition of
   zooxanthellae, animal tissue and skeleton was investigated in the
   scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata. Two sets of corals were grown
   with filtered seawater under controlled conditions. One group of
   colonies was fed Artemia sp. nauplii and compared to a control group
   that was starved. Fed corals exhibited higher concentrations of
   chlorophyll (60\% more), soluble protein (4 times more) and
   calcification rates (29\% more) than starved colonies. The net
   photosynthetic rate was higher in starved than in fed corals (18.53 +/-
   6.99 and 6.78 +/- 2.06 mumol O-2 cm(-2) h(-1) respectively), whereas
   dark respiration was not significantly different (8.74 +/- 2.27 and 6.66
   +/- 0.40 mumol O-2 cm(-2) h(-1)). The average delta(13)C value of
   Artemia sp. nauplii used for feeding was -12parts per thousand.
   delta(13)C was significantly heavier in zooxanthellae than in animal
   tissues, for both fed (-10.1 vs -11.7parts per thousand) and starved
   colonies (-10.9 vs -13.2parts per thousand.). Artemia sp. carbon was
   incorporated into the coral tissue as shown by the heavier delta(13)C in
   fed than in starved colonies (- 11.7 to -13.2parts per thousand,
   respectively), although there was no difference in the delta(13)C of the
   zooxanthellae fraction. Skeletal delta(13)C was similar in fed and
   starved colonies (mean -4.6parts per thousand). Skeletal delta(18)O
   composition was, however, significantly different between the 2
   treatments (-4.24 to -4.05parts per thousand. for fed and starved
   colonies, respectively), which may have been due to differences in the
   calcification rates of fed and starved corals. These data are used to
   establish a conceptual model of the carbon flow between the various
   compartments of a symbiotic coral. It suggests that the skeletal
   delta(13)C is not sensitive to heterotrophic food supply.},

Abstract = {Regulation of symbiotic zooxanthellae populations in hermatypic corals
   may include growth limitation by the host, release of healthy-looking
   zooxanthellae, and degradation of zooxanthellae. Here we experimentally
   change the zooxanthellae densities in branches of Stylophora pistillata
   corals through starvation and osmotic shock. We follow the subsequent
   changes of the zooxanthellae population dynamics. Prolonged starvation
   (40 days) caused a 50\% loss of zooxanthellae, a 70\% decrease in
   photosynthesis (P calculated per polyp), a 3-fold decrease in
   proliferating zooxanthellae frequency (PZF) and two-three-fold increase
   in degrading zooxanthellae frequency (DZF). The increase of the numbers
   of zooxanthellae in various stages of degradation was closely coupled to
   an increase in the release of degraded zooxanthellae particles (dzp). At
   the same time, zooxanthellae volume increased by 80\% but chlorophyll
   content and the photosynthetic capacity of the zooxanthellae did not
   change. Polyps subjected to osmotic shock (17 parts per thousand)
   expelled about one third of their zooxanthellae along with elements of
   animal cells. PZF and DZF levels varied slightly. We assume that
   zooxanthellae densities in corals are a consequence of differential
   rates of zooxanthellae division and degradation regulated by the coral
   host. Only under extreme conditions are zooxanthellae population
   densities regulated by expulsion of healthy zooxanthellae.},

Title = {Impact of feeding and short-term temperature stress on the content and

Abstract = {This study assesses the combined effect of feeding and short-term
   thermal stress on various physiological parameters and on the fatty
   acid, sterol, and alcohol composition of the scleractinian coral
   Turbinaria reniformis. The compound-specific carbon isotope composition
   of the lipids was also measured. Under control conditions (26A degrees
   C), feeding with Artemia salina significantly increased the symbiont
   density and chlorophyll content and the growth rates of the corals. It
   also doubled the concentrations of almost all fatty acid (FA) compounds
   and increased the n-alcohol and sterol contents. delta C-13 results
   showed that the feeding enhancement of FA concentrations occurred either
   via a direct pathway, for one of the major polyunsaturated fatty acid
   (PUFA) compounds of the food (18:3n-3 FA), or via an enhancement of
   photosynthate transfer (indirect pathway), for the other coral FAs.
   Cholesterol (C-27 Delta(5)) was also directly acquired from the food.
   Thermal stress (31A degrees C) affected corals, but differently
   according to their feeding status. Chlorophyll, protein content, and
   maximal photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) decreased to
   a greater extent in starved corals. In such corals, FA concentrations
   were reduced by 33\%, (especially C16, C18 FAs, and n-3 PUFA) and the
   sterol content by 27\% (especially the C(28)a dagger(5,22) and C(28)a
   dagger(5)). The enrichment in the delta C-13 signature of the storage
   and structural FAs suggests that they were the main compounds respired
   during the stress to maintain the coral metabolism. Thermal stress had
   less effect on the lipid concentrations of fed corals, as only FA levels
   were reduced by 13\%, with no major changes in their isotope carbon
   signatures. In conclusion, feeding plays an essential role in sustaining
   T. reniformis metabolism during the thermal stress.},

Abstract = {Atmospheric CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) is expected to increase to 700
   mu atm or more by the end of the present century. Anthropogenic CO2 is
   absorbed by the oceans, leading to decreases in pH and the CaCO3
   saturation state (Omega) of the seawater. Elevated pCO(2) was shown to
   drastically decrease calcification rates in tropical zooxanthellate
   corals. Here we show, using the Mediterranean zooxanthellate coral
   Cladocora caespitosa, that an increase in pCO(2), in the range predicted
   for 2100, does not reduce its calcification rate. Therefore, the
   conventional belief that calcification rates will be affected by ocean
   acidification may not be widespread in temperate corals. Seasonal change
   in temperature is the predominant factor controlling photosynthesis,
   respiration, calcification and symbiont density. An increase in pCO(2),
   alone or in combination with elevated temperature, had no significant
   effect on photosynthesis, photosynthetic efficiency and calcification.
   The lack of sensitivity C. caespitosa to elevated pCO(2) might be due to
   its slow growth rates, which seem to be more dependent on temperature
   than on the saturation state of calcium carbonate in the range projected
   for the end of the century.},

Abstract = {Reef-building corals owe their evolutionary success to their symbiosis
   with unicellular algae (Symbiodiniaceae). However, increasingly frequent
   heat waves lead to coral mass-bleaching events and pose a serious threat
   to the survival of reef ecosystems. Despite significant efforts, a
   mechanistic understanding of coral-algal symbiosis functioning, what
   leads to its breakdown and what can prevent it, remains incomplete. The
   main obstacles are low amenability of corals to experimental handling
   and, owing to its obligatory nature, the difficulties of manipulating
   the coral-algal association. Indeed, many studies on the symbiotic
   partnership are conducted on other cnidarian model organisms and their
   results may therefore not be fully transferable to tropical
   reef-building corals. Here, we identify the tropical stony coral species
   Galaxea fascicularis as a novel candidate coral model system. Individual
   polyps of this species can be separated, enabling highly replicated
   genotype studies, and are well suited to experimental investigation of
   the symbiosis as they can be easily and effectively rid of their algal
   symbionts (bleached). We show that bleached adult individuals can
   reestablish symbiosis with non-native symbionts, and we report the
   completion of the gametogenic cycle ex situ, with the successful
   spawning in aquaria over multiple years. These achievements help
   overcome several of the major limitations to direct research on corals
   and highlight the potential of G. fascicularis as an important new model
   system for investigations of symbiosis functioning and manipulation.},

Title = {Effects of thermal history on the responses to thermal stress of a large
   benthic foraminifera, <i>Calcarina gaudichaudii</i>},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Marine ecosystems, particularly coastal environments, are rapidly
   changing due to anthropogenic impacts resulting in increased global
   climate change (ocean warming), ocean acidification, hypoxia, and
   eutrophication. On coral reefs, symbiont-bearing large benthic
   foraminifera (LBFs) can play a key role as reef constituents and
   carbonate producers, contributing up to 5\% of reef-scale carbonate
   budgets. However, projected climate change, particularly ocean warming,
   has the potential to significantly alter the conditions in which marine
   organisms persist. While the response of LBFs to elevated thermal stress
   is well documented in laboratory studies, the potential influence of
   adaptation or acclimatization through prior environmental thermal
   history on this response remains largely unknown. In this study,
   specimens of Calcarina gaudichaudii, an LBF from the Penghu Islands,
   Taiwan, were collected from thermally variable intertidal and thermally
   stable subtidal (similar to 6 m depth) environments representing thermal
   history. LBFs were then acclimated to laboratory conditions at ambient
   (25 degrees C) and elevated (28 degrees C) temperatures for three weeks,
   and subsequently exposed to control and heat stress treatments (25
   degrees C, 28 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 33 degrees C) for an additional
   one week. Photosynthetic rates (determined through oxygen flux
   measurements) of C. gaudichaudii significantly decreased in specimens
   collected at subtidal depths acclimated at 25 degrees C when compared to
   those acclimated at 28 degrees C, whereas there was no effect of thermal
   history on respiration, indicating that symbiont and holobiont responses
   may differ in LBFs. Additionally, maximum photochemical efficiency
   (Fv/Fm) significantly decreased as a result of heat stress, although
   bleaching was not visually observed after one week. These results
   highlight the plastic responses of the algal microbiome and indicate
   that thermal history, acclimatization temperature, and heat stress
   interact to affect the physiological status of C. gaudichaudii. This
   study adds to the growing literature which highlights the larger
   implications of understanding thermal history as an important factor to
   consider to better understand how ecosystem processes (e.g., carbonate
   production) are altered on modern coral reefs.},

Abstract = {Elevated temperature (28-34-degrees-C) has been hypothesized as the
   primary cause of the loss of algal endosymbionts in coral
   reef-associated invertebrates, a phenomenon observed on a world-wide
   scale over the last decade. In past studies of this ``bleaching{''}
   phenomenon, there has been an underlying assumption that temperature
   adversely affects the animal hosts, the algae thereby being relegated to
   a more passive role. Because photosynthesis is a sensitive indicator of
   thermal stress in plants and has a central role in the nutrition of
   symbiotic invertebrates, we have tested the hypothesis that elevated
   temperature adversely affects photosynthesis in the symbiotic
   dinoflagellate Symbiodinium microadriaticum. The results, based on
   analyses of light-mediated O2 evolution and in vivo fluorescence,
   indicate that photosynthesis is impaired at temperatures above
   30-degrees-C and ceases completely at 34-36-degrees-C. These
   observations are discussed in the context of possible mechanisms that
   may function in the disassociation of algal-invertebrate symbioses in
   response to elevated temperature.},

Abstract = {In 2007 and 2008, multiple sites were identified in the Wakatobi Marine
   National Park, South East Sulawesi, Indonesia, which each represented a
   point along a gradient of light quality, temperature and turbidity. This
   gradient included `optimal', intermediate and marginal sites, where
   conditions were close to the survival threshold limit for corals. Coral
   communities changed across this gradient from diverse, mixed growth form
   assemblages to specialised, massive growth form dominated communities.
   The massive coral Goniastrea aspera was the only species identified at
   the most marginal and optimal sites. Branching species Acropora formosa
   and Porites cylindrica were only identified at optimal sites. The in
   hospite Symbiodinium community also changed across the environmental
   gradient from members of the Symbiodinium clade C on optimal reefs (in
   branching and massive species) to clade D on marginal reefs ( in massive
   species). Substantial variability in respiration and photosynthesis was
   observed in massive coral species under different environmental
   conditions, which suggests that all corals cannot be considered equal
   across environments. Studying present-day marginal environments is
   crucial to further understanding of future reef bio-diversity,
   functioning and accretion, and from work presented here, it is likely
   that as future climate change extends marginal reef range, branching
   coral diversity may decrease relative to massive, more resilient corals.

Abstract = {Elevated temperatures and solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation have been
   implicated as recent causes for the loss of symbiotic algae (i.e.,
   bleaching) in corals and other invertebrates with photoautotrophic
   symbionts. One hypothesized mechanism of coral bleaching involves the
   production of reduced oxygen intermediates, or toxic oxygen, in the
   dinoflagellate symbionts and]lost tissues that subsequently causes
   cellular damage and expulsion of symbionts. Measurements of
   photosynthesis in the Caribbean coral Agaricia tenuifolia, taken during
   temperature-induced stress and exposure to full solar radiation, showed
   a decrease in photosynthetic performance followed by bleaching. Exposure
   of corals to exogenous antioxidants that scavenge reactive oxygen
   species during temperature-induced stress improves maximum
   photosynthetic capacity to rates indistinguishable from corals measured
   at the ambient temperature of their site of collection. Additionally,
   these antioxidants prevent the coral from `'bleaching'' and affect the
   mechanism of symbiont loss from the coral host. These observations
   confirm a role for oxidative stress, whether caused by elevated
   temperatures or exposure to UV radiation, in the bleaching phenomenon.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2015},

Abstract = {Large-amplitude internal waves (LAW) cause intense drops in sea water
   temperature (6-9 degrees C) and acidity (0.6 pH units) within minutes,
   posing a major disturbance factor for shallow water corals in the
   Andaman Sea. During periods of elevated temperatures, however, they may
   provide a vital source of relief to heat-stressed corals. To assess the
   effect of LAIW on the thermal tolerance of the massive coral Porites
   lutea, we carried out a onemonth reciprocal LAIW simulation experiment
   with coral nubbins collected from the LAIW-exposed and LAIW-sheltered
   sides of the Similan Islands, an offshore archipelago near the Thai
   Andaman shelf break (distance of sampling locations <3 km). Corals from
   either origin were subjected to (1) ambient (29 degrees C, pH 839) vs.
   elevated (31.5 degrees C) temperatures; and (2) ambient temperatures
   with simulated LAIW (30 minute drops to 23.8 degrees C, pH 7.9, twice
   per day) vs. elevated temperatures with LAIW (30 minute drops to 24.9
   degrees C, pH 7.9, twice per day). Simulated LAIW reduced heat stress
   responses in all corals. However, nubbins from the LAIW-exposed site
   showed a higher tolerance to the heat stress than sheltered corals, i.e.
   lower bleaching- and mortality rates, higher photosynthetic performances
   and higher protein contents at the end of the experiment, despite
   identical algal symbiont genotypes (ITS-2, C15). Our results suggest
   that LAIW-induced nutrient availability, enhanced heterotrophic feeding
   and thermal variability increased the upper thermal resistance of P.
   lutea, supporting the notion that LAIW-exposed reefs might be important
   refugia for coral survival in a warming ocean. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {The consideration of `mutual benefits' and partner cooperation have long
   been the accepted standpoint from which to draw inference about the
   onset, maintenance and breakdown of the coral-algae endosymbiosis. In
   this paper, I review recent research into the climate-induced breakdown
   of this important symbiosis (namely `coral bleaching') that challenges
   the validity of this long-standing belief. Indeed, I introduce a more
   parsimonious explanation, in which the coral host exerts a `controlled
   parasitism' over its algal symbionts that is akin to an enforced
   domestication arrangement. Far from being pathogenic, a range of
   well-established cellular processes are reviewed that support the role
   of the coral host as an active `farmer' of the energy-rich
   photoassimilates from its captive symbionts. Importantly, this new
   paradigm reposes the deleterious bleaching response in terms of an
   envelope of environmental conditions in which the exploitative and
   captive measures of the coral host are severely restricted. The
   ramification of this new paradigm for developing management strategies
   that may assist the evolution of bleaching resistance in corals is
   discussed.},

Title = {Potential geochemical evidence of <i>Porites</i> corals responding to

Abstract = {To better understand the long-term survival of modern coral reefs under
   global warming, the history of past coral bleaching events prior to
   modern marine ecological surveys must be investigated. Here, 11 dead
   Porites and 2 Porites with growth hiatuses growing in the 20th century
   were collected from the Nansha Islands, southern South China Sea (SCS)
   for monthly Sr/Ca, delta O-18 and delta C-13 analyses to explore the
   climatic conditions and metabolic information corresponding to these
   growth structures. Among the 13 episodes, the results showed that 8
   mortalities occurred in the summers, coral MJ8 died in spring, and the
   other 2 mortalities and 2 growth hiatuses occurred in the cooling
   season. In addition to the dead surface of the coral mortalities, stress
   bands with significantly reduced growth rates could also be observed in
   the corals. Negative shifts in delta C-13 occurred prior to 5 coral
   mortalities and most stress bands were caused in summer, suggesting a
   sharp reduction in photosynthesis by decreased symbiotic zooxanthellae
   or photosynthetic pigments. Overall, the mortalities can be concluded to
   have occurred in summer and stress bands with abrupt delta C-13
   decreases in the last century were mainly caused by thermal coral
   bleaching in the southern SCS. This in turn suggests that the repeated
   coral bleaching and mortalities occurred much earlier before the 1980s,
   which is a longer-term response to modern global warming during the last
   century.},

Title = {Warm preconditioning protects against acute heat-induced respiratory

Abstract = {Preconditioning to non-stressful warming can protect some symbiotic
   cnidarians against the high temperature-induced collapse of their
   mutualistic endosymbiosis with photosynthetic dinoflagellates
   (Symbiodinium spp.), a process known as bleaching. Here, we sought to
   determine whether such preconditioning is underpinned by differential
   regulation of aerobic respiration. We quantified in vivo metabolism and
   mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activity in the naturally symbiotic sea
   anemone Exaiptasia pallida preconditioned to 30 degrees C for > 7 weeks
   as well as anemones kept at 26 degrees C. Preconditioning resulted in
   increased Symbiodinium photosynthetic activity and holobiont (host+
   symbiont) respiration rates. Biomassnormalised activities of host
   respiratory enzymes {[}citrate synthase and the mitochondrial electron
   transport chain (mETC) complexes I and IV] were higher in preconditioned
   animals, suggesting that increased holobiont respiration may have been
   due to host mitochondrial biogenesis and/or enlargement. Subsequent
   acute heating of preconditioned and ` thermally naive' animals to 33
   degrees C induced dramatic increases in host mETC complex I and
   Symbiodinium mETC complex II activities only in thermally naive E.
   pallida. These changes were not reflected in the activities of other
   respiratory enzymes. Furthermore, bleaching in preconditioned E. pallida
   (defined as the significant loss of symbionts) was delayed by several
   days relative to the thermally naive group. These findings suggest that
   changes to mitochondrial biogenesis and/or function in symbiotic
   cnidarians during warm preconditioning might play a protective role
   during periods of exposure to stressful heating.},

Abstract = {Massive coral bleaching events result in extensive coral loss throughout
   the world. These events are mainly caused by seawater warming, but are
   exacerbated by the subsequent decrease in nutrient availability in
   surface waters. It has therefore been shown that nitrogen, phosphorus or
   iron limitation contribute to the underlying conditions by which thermal
   stress induces coral bleaching. Generally, information on the trophic
   ecology of trace elements (micronutrients) in corals, and on how they
   modulate the coral response to thermal stress is lacking. Here, we
   demonstrate for the first time that heterotrophic feeding (i.e. the
   capture of zooplankton prey by the coral host) and thermal stress induce
   significant changes in micro element concentrations and isotopic
   signatures of the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata. The results
   obtained first reveal that coral symbionts are the major sink for the
   heterotrophically acquired micronutrients and accumulate manganese,
   magnesium and iron from the food. These metals are involved in
   photosynthesis and antioxidant protection. In addition, we show that fed
   corals can maintain high micronutrient concentrations in the host tissue
   during thermal stress and do not bleach, whereas unfed corals experience
   a significant decrease in copper, zinc, boron, calcium and magnesium in
   the host tissue and bleach. In addition, the significant increase in
   Cu-65 and Zn-66 signature of symbionts and host tissue at high
   temperature suggests that these isotopic compositions are good proxy for
   stress in corals. Overall, present findings highlight a new way in which
   coral heterotrophy and micronutrient availability contribute to coral
   resistance to global warming and bleaching.},

Title = {Exploring mechanisms that affect coral cooperation: symbiont
   transmission mode, cell density and community composition},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {DEC 3},
Abstract = {The coral symbiosis is the linchpin of the reef ecosystem, yet the
   mechanisms that promote and maintain cooperation between hosts and
   symbionts have not been fully resolved. We used a phylogenetically
   controlled design to investigate the role of vertical symbiont
   transmission, an evolutionary mechanism in which symbionts are inherited
   directly from parents, predicted to enhance cooperation and holobiont
   fitness. Six species of coral, three vertical transmitters and their
   closest horizontally transmitting relatives, which exhibit environmental
   acquisition of symbionts, were fragmented and subjected to a 2-week
   thermal stress experiment. Symbiont cell density, photosynthetic
   function and translocation of photosynthetically fixed carbon between
   symbionts and hosts were quantified to assess changes in physiological
   performance and cooperation. All species exhibited similar decreases in
   symbiont cell density and net photosynthesis in response to elevated
   temperature, consistent with the onset of bleaching. Yet baseline
   cooperation, or translocation of photosynthate, in ambient conditions
   and the reduction in cooperation in response to elevated temperature
   differed among species. Although Porites lobata and Galaxea acrhelia did
   exhibit the highest levels of baseline cooperation, we did not observe
   universally higher levels of cooperation in vertically transmitting
   species. Post hoc sequencing of the Symbiodinium ITS-2 locus was used to
   investigate the potential role of differences in symbiont community
   composition. Interestingly, reductions in cooperation at the onset of
   bleaching tended to be associated with increased symbiont community
   diversity among coral species. The theoretical benefits of evolving
   vertical transmission are based on the underlying assumption that the
   host-symbiont relationship becomes genetically uniform, thereby reducing
   competition among symbionts. Taken together, our results suggest that it
   may not be vertical transmission per se that influences host-symbiont
   cooperation, but genetic uniformity of the symbiont community, although
   additional work is needed to test this hypothesis.},

Title = {Response of the temperate scleractinian coral <i>Cladocora
   caespitosa</i> to high temperature and long-term nutrient enrichment},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic nutrient enrichment and increased seawater temperatures
   are responsible for coral reef decline. In particular, they disrupt the
   relationship between corals and their dinoflagellate symbionts
   (bleaching). However, some coral species can afford either high
   temperatures or nutrient enrichment and their study can bring new
   insights into how corals acclimate or adapt to stressors. Here, we
   focused on the role of the nutrient history in influencing the response
   of the Mediterranean scleractinian coral Cladocora caespitosa to thermal
   stress. Colonies living naturally in nutrient-poor (<0.5 mu M nitrogen,
   <0.2 mu M phosphorus, LN) and nutrient-rich (ca. 10-20 mu M nitrogen,
   0.4 mu M phosphorus, HN) locations were sampled, maintained under the
   right nutrient conditions, and exposed to a temperature increase from 17
   degrees C to 24 degrees C and 29 degrees C. While both HN and LN
   colonies decreased their concentrations of symbionts and/or
   photosynthetic pigments, HN colonies were able to maintain significant
   higher rates of net and gross photosynthesis at 24 degrees C compared to
   LN colonies. In addition, while there was no change in protein
   concentration in HN corals during the experiment, proteins continuously
   decreased in LN corals with increased temperature. These results are
   important in that they show that nutrient history can influence the
   response of scleractinian corals to thermal stress. Further
   investigations of under-studied coral groups are thus required in the
   future to understand the processes leading to coral resistance to
   environmental perturbations.},

Abstract = {Coral bleaching events are increasing in frequency and severity
   worldwide. From the perspective of energy supply, a decrease in
   symbiotic zooxanthellae density (ZD) during bleaching leads to a
   reduction in the amount of energy provided by photosynthesis to the
   coral host. However, there are still many unknowns about how corals
   maintain the stability of their energy supply when zooxanthellae
   decrease. In this study, 89 coral samples, including the relatively
   stress-tolerant massive Favia palauensis and Porites lutea and the
   relatively vulnerable branching Acropora millepora and Pocillopora
   damicornis, were collected from the Xisha Islands in the South China Sea
   in spring and summer 2020. The physiological parameters ZD, chl a,
   tissue biomass and lipid content were measured. The delta C-13
   compositions of zooxanthellae and hosts were analyzed to explore the
   changes in trophic status in summer. Results show that the ZDs of A.
   millepora, P. damicornis, F. palauensis and P. lutea significantly
   decreased by 32, 29, 22 and 22\%, respectively, in summer. P. lutea and
   F. palauensis maintained metabolic energy requirements depending largely
   on heterotrophy. A. millepora and P. damicornis were more dependent on
   consuming their own lipids. Our study shows that there are intergeneric
   differences in the energy maintenance mechanisms used to cope with
   decreases in ZD. We suggest that the higher heterotrophic ability of F.
   palauensis and P. lutea renders their trophic status more plastic than
   that of A. millepora and P. damicornis. This characteristic may
   potentially affect their bleaching resilience.},

Abstract = {Coral bleaching events, predicted to increase in frequency and severity
   as a result of climate change, are a threat to tropical coral-reef
   ecosystems worldwide. Although the onset of spatially extensive, or
   `mass', bleaching events can be predicted using simple temperature
   stress metrics, no models are available for predicting coral mortality
   risk or sub-lethal stress associated with bleaching. Here, we develop a
   model that links the functional response of colony energy balance and
   energy-store dynamics to coral mortality risk and recovery during and
   following bleaching events.
   In a series of simulations using response functions and parameter values
   derived from experimental studies for two Indo-Pacific coral species
   (Acropora intermedia and Montipora monasteriata), we demonstrate that
   prior energy-costly disturbances and alternative energy sources are both
   important determinants of coral mortality risk during and following
   bleaching.
   The timing of the onset of coral mass mortality is determined by a
   combination of bleaching severity (loss rate of photopigments), duration
   of the bleaching event, heterotrophy and the size of energy reserves (as
   lipid stores) before bleaching occurs.
   Depending on initial energy reserves, model results showed that high
   rates of heterotrophy could delay the onset of coral mortality by up to
   three weeks. Survival following bleaching was also strongly influenced
   by remaining lipid reserves, rates of heterotrophy, and rates of
   photopigment (or symbiont) recovery.
   Our results indicate that energy-costly disturbances and low
   availability of food, before and during bleaching events, respectively,
   work to increase bleaching-induced coral mortality risk for acroporid
   corals on Indo-Pacific reefs.},

Abstract = {Bleaching of reef corals is a phenomenon linked to temperature stress
   which involves loss of the symbiotic algae of the coral, which are known
   as zooxanthellae, and/or loss of algal pigments, The photosynthetic
   efficiency of zooxanthellae within the corals Montastrea annularis,
   Agaricia lamarki, Agaricia agaricites and Siderastrea radians was
   examined by pulse-amplitude modulation fluorometry (PAM) during exposure
   to elevated temperatures (30-36 degrees C). Zooxanthellae within M.
   annularis and A. lamarki were found to be more sensitive to elevated
   temperature, virtually complete disruption of photosynthesis being noted
   during exposure to temperatures of 32 and 34 degrees C. The
   photosynthetic efficiency of zooxanthellae within S. radians and A.
   agaricites decreased to a lesser extent, Differences in the loss of
   algal cells on an aerial basis and in the cellular chlorophyll
   concentration were also found between these species. By combining the
   noninvasive PAM technique with whole-cell fluorescence of freshly
   isolated zooxanthellae, we have identified fundamental differences in
   the physiology of the symbionts within different species of coral.
   Zooxanthellae within M. annularis appear to be more susceptible to
   heat-induced damage at or near the reaction centre of Photosystem II,
   while zooxanthellae living in S. radians remain capable of dissipating
   excess excitation energy through non-photochemical pathways, thereby
   protecting the photosystem from damage during heat exposure.},

Abstract = {Coral bleaching events are increasing in frequency, demanding
   examination of the physiological and molecular responses of
   scleractinian corals and their algal symbionts (Symbiodinium sp.) to
   stressors associated with bleaching. Here, we quantify the effects of
   long-term (95-day) thermal and CO2-acidification stress on photochemical
   efficiency of in hospite Symbiodinium within the coral Siderastrea
   siderea, along with corresponding coral color intensity, for corals from
   two reef zones (forereef, nearshore) on the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef
   System. We then explore the molecular responses of in hospite
   Symbiodinium to these stressors via genome-wide gene expression
   profiling. Elevated temperatures reduced symbiont photochemical
   efficiencies and were highly correlated with coral color loss. However,
   photochemical efficiencies of forereef symbionts were more negatively
   affected by thermal stress than nearshore symbionts, suggesting greater
   thermal tolerance and/or reduced photodamage in nearshore corals. At
   control temperatures, CO2-acidification had little effect on symbiont
   physiology, although forereef symbionts exhibited constitutively higher
   photochemical efficiencies than nearshore symbionts. Gene expression
   profiling revealed that S. siderea were dominated by Symbiodinium
   goreaui (C1), except under thermal stress, which caused shifts to
   thermotolerant Symbiodinium trenchii (D1a). Comparative transcriptomics
   of conserved genes across the host and symbiont revealed few
   differentially expressed S. goreaui genes when compared to S. siderea,
   highlighting the host's role in the coral's response to environmental
   stress. Although S. goreaui transcriptomes did not vary in response to
   acidification stress, their gene expression was strongly dependent on
   reef zone, with forereef S. goreaui exhibiting enrichment of genes
   associated with photosynthesis. This finding, coupled with
   constitutively higher forereef S. goreaui photochemical efficiencies,
   suggests that functional differences in genes associated with primary
   production exist between reef zones.},

Title = {Evidence for mitigation of coral bleaching by manganese},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 14},
Abstract = {Unprecedented mass coral bleaching events due to global warming and
   overall seawater pollution have been observed worldwide over the last
   decades. Although metals are often considered as toxic substances for
   corals, some are essential at nanomolar concentrations for physiological
   processes such as photosynthesis and antioxidant defenses. This study
   was designed to elucidate, the individual and combined effects of
   nanomolar seawater enrichment in manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe), on the
   main physiological traits of Stylophora pistillata, maintained under
   normal growth and thermal stress conditions. We provide, for the first
   time, evidence that Mn is a key trace element for coral symbionts,
   enhancing cellular chlorophyll concentrations, photosynthetic efficiency
   and gross photosynthetic rates at ambient temperature. Our experiment
   also highlights the key role of Mn in increasing coral resistance to
   heat stress-induced bleaching. While Mn-enriched corals did not bleach
   and did not reduce their rates of photosynthesis and calcification,
   control corals experienced significant bleaching. On the contrary to Mn,
   Fe enrichment not only impaired calcification but induced significant
   bleaching. Such information is an important step towards a better
   understanding of the response of corals to seawater enrichment in
   metals. It can also explain, to some extent, species susceptibility to
   environmental stress.},

Abstract = {The temperate, symbiotic coral Cladocora caespitosa occurs naturally
   with variable numbers of zooxanthellae. This allows us to study
   differences in the physiology of symbiotic and `'non-symbiotic'' polyps
   and to correlate them with zooxanthellae activities.
   Zooxanthellae density in `'dark'' (normal-colored) polyps was 50 times
   higher than in `'white'' (bleached) polyps.
   The chlorophyll a content per zooxanthella was 3 times, and Chl c was 13
   times higher in white polyps than in dark ones. O2-flux experiments were
   conducted with colonies in situ and with single polyps - dark and white
   - under laboratory conditions. Two approaches were used to evaluate the
   contribution of zooxanthellae translocation products to animal
   respiration. Both revealed that the animal tissues derive a higher
   benefit from the zooxanthellae during periods of low water temperature
   than during warm periods.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs across the globe are threatened by warming oceans. The last
   few years have seen the worst mass coral bleaching events recorded, with
   more than one quarter of all reefs irreversibly impacted. Considering
   the widespread devastation, we need to increase our efforts to
   understanding the physiological and metabolic shifts underlying the
   breakdown of this important symbiotic ecosystem. Here, we investigated
   the proteome (PRIDE accession \# PXD011668) of both host and symbionts
   of the reef-building coral Acropora millepora exposed to ambient
   (similar to 28 degrees C) and elevated temperature (similar to 32
   degrees C for 2 days, following a five-day incremental increase) and
   explored associated biomolecular changes in the symbiont, with the aim
   of gaining new insights into the mechanisms underpinning the collapse of
   the coral symbiosis. We identified 1,230 unique proteins (774 host and
   456 symbiont) in the control and thermally stressed corals, of which 107
   significantly increased and 125 decreased in abundance under elevated
   temperature relative to the control. Proteins involved in oxidative
   stress and proteolysis constituted 29\% of the host proteins that
   increased in abundance, with evidence of impairment to endoplasmic
   reticulum and cytoskeletal regulation proteins. In the symbiont, we
   detected a decrease in proteins responsible for photosynthesis and
   energy production (33\% of proteins decreased in abundance), yet minimal
   signs of oxidative stress or proteolysis. Lipid stores increased >
   twofold despite reduction in photosynthesis, suggesting reduced
   translocation of carbon to the host. There were significant changes in
   proteins related to symbiotic state, including proteins linked to
   nitrogen metabolism in the host and the V-ATPase (-0.6 fold change)
   known to control symbiosome acidity. These results highlight key
   differences in host and symbiont proteomic adjustments under elevated
   temperature and identify two key proteins directly involved in bilateral
   nutrient exchange as potential indicators of symbiosis breakdown.},

Abstract = {The sensitivity of corals and their Symbiodinium to warming has been
   extensively documented; however very few studies considered that
   anthropogenic inputs such as metal pollution have already an impact on
   many fringing reefs. Thus, today, nickel releases are common in coastal
   ecosystems. In this study, two major reef-building species Acropora
   muricata and Pocillopora damicornis were exposed in situ to ambient and
   moderate nickel concentrations on a short-term period (1 h) using
   benthic chamber experiments. Simultaneously, we tested in laboratory
   conditions the combined effects of a chronic exposure (8 weeks) to
   moderate nickel concentrations and ocean warming on A. muricata. The in
   situ experiment highlighted that nickel enrichment, at ambient
   temperature, stimulated by 27 to 47\% the calcification rates of both
   species but not their photosynthetic performances. In contrast, an
   exposure to higher nickel concentration, in combination with elevated
   temperature simulated in aquaria, severely depressed by 30\% the growth
   of A. muricata.},

Title = {Physiological acclimatization in Hawaiian corals following a 22-month
   shift in baseline seawater temperature and pH},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Climate change poses a major threat to coral reefs. We conducted an
   outdoor 22-month experiment to investigate if coral could not just
   survive, but also physiologically cope, with chronic ocean warming and
   acidification conditions expected later this century under the Paris
   Climate Agreement. We recorded survivorship and measured eleven
   phenotypic traits to evaluate the holobiont responses of Hawaiian coral:
   color, Symbiodiniaceae density, calcification, photosynthesis,
   respiration, total organic carbon flux, carbon budget, biomass, lipids,
   protein, and maximum Artemia capture rate. Survivorship was lowest in
   Montipora capitata and only some survivors were able to meet metabolic
   demand and physiologically cope with future ocean conditions. Most M.
   capitata survivors bleached through loss of chlorophyll pigments and
   simultaneously experienced increased respiration rates and negative
   carbon budgets due to a 236\% increase in total organic carbon losses
   under combined future ocean conditions. Porites compressa and Porites
   lobata had the highest survivorship and coped well under future ocean
   conditions with positive calcification and increased biomass,
   maintenance of lipids, and the capacity to exceed their metabolic demand
   through photosynthesis and heterotrophy. Thus, our findings show that
   significant biological diversity within resilient corals like Porites,
   and some genotypes of sensitive species, will persist this century
   provided atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are controlled. Since Porites
   corals are ubiquitous throughout the world's oceans and often major reef
   builders, the persistence of this resilient genus provides hope for
   future reef ecosystem function globally.},

Title = {Phytotoxicity of Photosystem II (PSII) herbicides to coral},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {261},
Pages = {149-159},
Abstract = {Recent reports of contamination of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park by
   herbicides used in antifouling paints and in agriculture have caused
   concern over the possible effects on corals in nearshore areas.
   Pulse-Amplitude Modulated (PAM) chlorophyll fluorescence techniques were
   used to examine changes in the maximum effective quantum yield
   (DeltaF/F-m') of symbiotic dinoflagellates within the host tissues (in
   hospite) of the coral Seriatopora hystrix exposed to a number of
   Photosystem 11 (PSII) inhibiting herbicides in short-term toxicity
   tests. The concentration of herbicide required to reduce DeltaF/F-m' by
   50\% (median effective concentration {[}EC50]) differed by over 2 orders
   of magnitude: Irgarol 1051 (0.7 mug l(-1)) > ametryn (1.7 mug l(-1)) >
   diuron (2.3 mug l(-1)) > hexazinone (8.8 mug l(-1)) > atrazine (45 mug
   l(-1)) > simazine (150 mug l(-1)) > tebuthiuron (175 mug l(-1)) >
   ionynil (>1 mg l(-1)). Similar absolute and relative toxicities were
   observed with colonies of the coral Acropora formosa (Irgarol 1051 EC50:
   1.3 mug l(-1), diuron EC50: 2.8 mug l(-1)). Time-course experiments
   indicated that DeltaF/F-m' was rapidly reduced (i.e. within minutes) in
   S. hystrix exposed to Irgarol 1051 and diuron. On return to fresh
   running seawater, DeltaF/F-m' recovered quickly in diuron-exposed corals
   (i.e. in minutes to hours), but slowly in corals exposed to Irgarol 1051
   (i.e. hours to days). Time-course experiments indicated that the effects
   of diuron (3 mug l(-1)) on S. hystrix were inversely related to
   temperature over the range 20 to 30degreesC, although initially the
   effects were less at the lower temperatures. Repeated exposure to pulses
   of Irgarol 1051 (daily 2 h exposure to 30 mug l(-1) over 4 d) resulted
   in a 30\% decrease in the density of symbiotic dinoflagellates in the
   tissues of S. hystrix.},

Abstract = {The climate and environmental significance of the stable strontium
   isotope composition (delta Sr-88) in coral skeletons deserves further
   investigation. To improve our understanding of stable strontium isotope
   fractionation during the biomineralization process, correlations between
   monthly coral skeletal delta Sr-88 values and climatic and environmental
   variables (along with their corresponding geochemical proxies) between
   2008 and 2009 were studied using a massive zooxanthellae Porites coral
   head from Sanya Bay on the south coast of Hainan Island in the northern
   South China Sea. Sea surface temperature and its corresponding
   geochemical proxies (Sr/Ca and delta O-18), pH and its proxy delta B-11,
   and precipitation (representing river runoff) show clear annual cycles,
   but their correlations with coral delta Sr-88 were not significant
   during 2008 and 2009. However, both total solar irradiance (TSI) and
   coral delta Sr-88 values followed a gradually increasing trend over the
   study period and showed a statistically significant correlation. These
   results indicate that the fractionation associated with coral skeleton
   delta Sr-88 is not temperature-dependent, but TSI may play a major role
   in controlling coral delta Sr-88 values at our study site. The
   underlying mechanism of TSI-induced Sr-88/Sr-86 fractionation in coral
   skeletons may be similar to that associated with coral delta C-13. That
   is, symbiotic zooxanthellae preferentially uptakes Sr-86 during
   photosynthesis leaving the internal strontium reservoirs enriched in
   Sr-88; consequently, increased uptake of Sr-88 by the coral skeleton
   occurs when photosynthetic rates increase. However, the correlation
   between coral delta Sr-88 and delta C-13 values may be masked by the
   carbon input from terrestrial river runoff and the kinetic isotope
   fractionation effect during the calcification process.},

Title = {Fast Growth May Impair Regeneration Capacity in the Branching Coral
   <i>Acropora muricata</i>},

Abstract = {Regeneration of artificially induced lesions was monitored in nubbins of
   the branching coral Acropora muricata at two reef-flat sites
   representing contrasting environments at Reunion Island (21 degrees
   07'S, 55 degrees 32'E). Growth of these injured nubbins was examined in
   parallel, and compared to controls. Biochemical compositions of the
   holobiont and the zooxanthellae density were determined at the onset of
   the experiment, and the photosynthetic efficiency (F-v/F-m) of
   zooxanthellae was monitored during the experiment. Acropora muricata
   rapidly regenerated small lesions, but regeneration rates significantly
   differed between sites. At the sheltered site characterized by high
   temperatures, temperature variations, and irradiance levels,
   regeneration took 192 days on average. At the exposed site,
   characterized by steadier temperatures and lower irradiation, nubbins
   demonstrated fast lesion repair (81 days), slower growth, lower
   zooxanthellae density, chlorophyll a concentration and lipid content
   than at the former site. A trade-off between growth and regeneration
   rates was evident here. High growth rates seem to impair regeneration
   capacity. We show that environmental conditions conducive to high
   zooxanthellae densities in corals are related to fast skeletal growth
   but also to reduced lesion regeneration rates. We hypothesize that a
   lowered regenerative capacity may be related to limited availability of
   energetic and cellular resources, consequences of coral holobionts
   operating at high levels of photosynthesis and associated growth.},

Abstract = {Throughout the coral reef scientific literature, there are many examples
   where the words `synergy' and `synergism' are being misused,
   particularly in the area of study involving interactions between
   physical stressors. This Perspective discusses the concept of synergy
   and more generally, interactions; summarises the tools available for
   detecting and interpreting interactions, including the use of ANOVA,
   generalized linear models, classification and regression trees and
   isobolographic analysis; and critically examines specific areas of the
   scientific literature where synergy has been reported. The aim is to
   promote further discussion of this topic, avoid future misuse of the
   term, and assist future experimental design and research into this
   subject.},

Title = {Interactive effects of climate change and eutrophication on the
   dinoflagellate-bearing benthic foraminifer Marginopora vertebralis},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {401-414},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Elevated sea surface temperatures caused by global climate change and
   increased nutrient concentrations resulting from land runoff both are
   stressors for calcifying coral reef organisms. Here, we test the
   hypothesis that increased temperature leads to bleaching in
   dinoflagellate-bearing foraminifera similar to corals and that increased
   nutrients through runoff can exaggerate stress on the holobiont. In an
   experiment manipulating temperatures alone, we have shown that mortality
   of Marginopora vertebralis increased with temperatures. Most individuals
   died after 7 days at 34A degrees C, similar to 5A degrees C above
   current summer maxima. Survival at 37 days was > 98\% at 28A degrees C.
   After 7 days of exposure to 31 or 32A degrees C, photosynthesis of the
   endosymbionts was compromised, as indicated by several
   photophysiological parameters (effective quantum yield and apparent
   photosynthetic rate). In a flow-though experiment manipulating both
   temperature (three levels, 26, 29 and 31A degrees C) and nitrate
   concentrations (3 levels, similar to 0.5, 1.0 and 1.4 mu mol l(-1) NO3
   (-)), elevated temperature had a significant negative effect on most
   parameters measured. At 31A degrees C, most photopigments (measured by
   UPLC) in the foraminifera were significantly reduced. The only pigment
   that increased was the photoprotective diatoxanthin. Several other
   parameters measured (maximum and effective quantum yield, O-2 production
   in light, organic carbon contents) also significantly decreased with
   temperature. Optode-based respirometry demonstrated that the presence of
   symbionts at elevated temperatures represents a net carbon loss for the
   host. Growth rates of M. vertebralis and mortality at the end of the
   experiment were significantly affected by both temperature increase and
   nitrate addition. We conclude that these foraminifera bleach in a
   similar fashion to corals and that global sea surface temperature change
   and nitrate increases are stressors for these protists. Furthermore,
   this provides support for the hypothesis that management of local
   stressors elevates resilience of coral reefs to global stressors.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},
Number = {182},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Coral reefs are constructed by calcifying coral animals that engage in a
   symbiosis with dinoflagellate microalgae harboured in their tissue. The
   symbiosis takes place in the presence of steep and dynamic gradients of
   light, temperature and chemical species that are affected by the
   structural and optical properties of the coral and their interaction
   with incident irradiance and water flow. Microenvironmental analyses
   have enabled quantification of such gradients and bulk coral tissue and
   skeleton optical properties, but the multi-layered nature of corals and
   its implications for the optical, thermal and chemical microenvironment
   remains to be studied in more detail. Here, we present a multiphysics
   modelling approach, where three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations of
   the light field in a simple coral slab morphology with multiple tissue
   layers were used as input for modelling the heat dissipation and
   photosynthetic oxygen production driven by photon absorption. By
   coupling photon, heat and mass transfer, the model predicts light,
   temperature and O-2 gradients in the coral tissue and skeleton, under
   environmental conditions simulating, for example, tissue
   contraction/expansion, symbiont loss via coral bleaching or different
   distributions of coral host pigments. The model reveals basic
   structure-function mechanisms that shape the microenvironment and
   ecophysiology of the coral symbiosis in response to environmental
   change.},

Abstract = {During the past several decades, corals worldwide have been affected by
   severe bleaching events leading to wide-spread coral mortality triggered
   by global warming. The symbiotic Red Sea coral Stylophora pistillata
   from the Gulf of Eilat is considered an opportunistic r' strategist. It
   can thrive in relatively unstable environments and is considered a
   stress-tolerant species. Here, we used a S. pistillata custom microarray
   to examine gene expression patterns and cellular pathways during
   short-term (13-day) heat stress. The results allowed us to identify a
   two-step reaction to heat stress, which intensified significantly as the
   temperature was raised to a 32 degrees C threshold, beyond which, coping
   strategies failed at 34 degrees C. We identified potential early warning
   genes' and severe heat-related genes'. Our findings suggest that during
   short-term heat stress, S. pistillata may divert cellular energy into
   mechanisms such as the ER-unfolded protein response (UPR) and
   ER-associated degradation (ERAD) at the expense of growth and
   biomineralization processes in an effort to survive and subsequently
   recover from the stress. We suggest a mechanistic theory for the heat
   stress responses that may explain the success of some species which can
   thrive under a wider range of temperatures relative to others.},

   Different Corals Subjected to Environmental Stress in Hong Kong},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {APR 23},
Abstract = {Coral reefs are extremely vulnerable to global climate change, as
   evidenced by increasing bleaching events. Previous studies suggest that
   both algal and microbial partners benefit coral hosts, but the nature of
   interactions between Symbiodiniaceae and prokaryotic microbes and their
   effects on coral hosts remains unclear. In the present study, we
   examined correlations between Symbiodiniaceae and prokaryotic microbes
   in Montipora spp. and Porites lutea sampled from two sites in Hong Kong
   with contrasting environmental conditions in March and October 2014. The
   results showed that the prokaryotic microbial communities had adaptable
   structures in both Montipora spp. and P. lutea, and environmental
   conditions had greater effects on the algal/microbial communities in
   Montipora spp. than in P. lutea. Further network analysis revealed a
   greater number of prokaryotic microbes were significantly correlated
   with potentially stress-resistant Symbiodiniaceae in P. lutea than in
   Montipora spp. Stress-resistant Symbiodiniaceae played more important
   roles in the community and in the algal-microbial correlations in P.
   lutea than in Montipora spp. Since P. lutea is faring better in Hong
   Kong as the seawater temperature gradually increases, the results
   suggest that the correlations between stress-resistant algae and
   prokaryotic microbes could provide a compensation mechanism allowing
   coral hosts to adapt to higher temperatures, particularly as the
   prokaryotic microbes correlated with Symbiodiniaceae provide the
   ecological functions of photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation.},

Abstract = {There is overwhelming evidence that tropical coral reefs are severely
   impacted by human induced climate change. Assessing the capability of
   reef-building corals to expand their tolerance limits to survive
   projected climate trajectories is critical for their protection and
   management. Acclimation mechanisms such as developmental plasticity may
   provide one means by which corals could cope with projected ocean
   warming and acidification. To assess the potential of preconditioning to
   enhance thermal tolerance in the coral Pocillopora acuta, colonies were
   kept under three different scenarios from settlement to 17 months old:
   present day (0.9 \& DEG;C-weeks (Degree Heating Weeks), + 0.75 \& DEG;C
   annual, 400 ppm pCO(2)) mid-century (2.5 \& DEG;C-weeks, + 1.5 \& DEG;C
   annual, 685 ppm pCO(2)) and end of century (5 \& DEG;C-weeks, + 2 \&
   DEG;C annual, 900 ppm pCO(2)) conditions. Colonies from the present-day
   scenario were subsequently introduced to the mid-century and end of
   century conditions for six weeks during summer thermal maxima to examine
   if preconditioned colonies (reared under these elevated conditions) had
   a higher physiological performance compared to naive individuals.
   Symbiodiniaceae density and chlorophyll a concentrations were
   significantly lower in mid-century and end of century preconditioned
   groups, and declines in symbiont density were observed over the six-week
   accumulated heat stress in all treatments. Maximum photosynthetic rate
   was significantly suppressed in mid-century and end of century
   preconditioned groups, while minimum saturating irradiances were highest
   for 2050 pre-exposed individuals with parents originating from specific
   populations. The results of this study indicate preconditioning to
   elevated temperature and pCO(2) for 17 months did not enhance the
   physiological performance in P. acuta. However, variations in trait
   responses and effects on tolerance found among treatment groups provides
   evidence for differential capacity for phenotypic plasticity among
   populations which could have valuable applications for future
   restoration efforts.},

Title = {Effects of climate change and light limitation on coral recruits},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {690},
Pages = {65-82},
Month = {JUN 2},
Abstract = {Climate change impacts and light attenuation from suspended sediments,
   due to runoff, natural resuspension or dredging, can both impede the
   replenishment of coral populations. Here we tested the independent and
   combined impacts of climate change (current temperature and dissolved
   CO2, and 2 future climate scenarios) and a 1 mo long light attenuation
   period at 5 different light levels (0.1 to 4 mol photons m(-2) d(-1)) on
   early Acropora millepora recruits. Additionally, we evaluated whether
   the effects were age dependent by comparing responses of recruits that
   were 1 mo old ('early attenuation') vs. 2 mo old ('late attenuation').
   Recruit survival, size and Symbiodiniaceae densities increased slightly
   under moderate future climate conditions (current temperature + 0.44
   degrees C, 692 ppm pCO(2)), but decreased under a more severe climate
   scenario (+ 0.94 degrees C, 985 ppm pCO(2)). Light attenuation
   significantly decreased recruit survival, size and Symbiodiniaceae
   densities only for recruits exposed to the late attenuation, suggesting
   an increasing reliance on photosynthesis as recruits age. Under the more
   severe climate scenario tested, recruit survival was diminished by both
   climate change (<= 18 +/- 4\% {[}SE] in the early attenuation) and light
   limitation (<= 32 +/- 6\% in the late attenuation) compared with
   controls. However, there was no interaction between future climate
   scenarios and light attenuation, indicating that these effects were
   additive. This study demonstrates the potential effects of light
   limitation and future climate conditions on coral recruitment success
   and highlights the need to manage the timing of sediment-generating
   activities near reefs to optimise light availability for several months
   post settlement.},

Title = {Increased coral biomineralization due to enhanced symbiotic activity
   upon volcanic ash exposure},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {912},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {Coral reefs, which are among the most productive ecosystems on earth,
   are in global decline due to rapid climate change. Volcanic activity
   also results in extreme environmental changes at local to global scales,
   and may have significant impacts on coral reefs compared to other
   natural disturbances. During explosive eruptions, large amounts of
   volcanic ash are generated, significantly disrupting ecosystems close to
   a volcano, and depositing ash over distal areas (10s -1000s of km
   depending on i.a. eruption size and wind direction). Once volcanic ash
   interacts with seawater, the dissolution of metals leads to a rapid
   change in the geochemical properties of the seawater column. Here, we
   report the first known effects of volcanic ash on the physiology and
   elemental cycling of a symbiotic scleractinian coral under laboratory
   conditions. Nubbins of the branching coral Stylophora pistillata were
   reared in aquaria under controlled conditions (insolation, temperature,
   and pH), while environmental parameters, effective quantum yield, and
   skeletal growth rate were monitored. Half the aquaria were exposed to
   volcanic ash every other day for 6 weeks (250 mg L-1 week-1), which
   induced significant changes in the fluorescence-derived photochemical
   parameters (phi PSII, Fv/Fm, NPQ, rETR), directly enhanced the
   efficiency of symbiont photosynthesis (Pg, Pn), and lead to increased
   biomineralization rates. Enhancement of symbiont photosynthesis is
   induced by the supply of essential metals (Fe and Mn), derived from
   volcanic ash leaching in ambient seawater or within the organism
   following ingestion. The beneficial role of volcanic ash as an important
   micronutrient source is supported by the fact that neither
   photophysiological stress nor signs of lipid peroxi-dation were
   detected. Subaerial volcanism affects micronutrient cycling in the coral
   ecosystem, but the impli-cation for coral ecophysiology on a reef scale
   remains to be tested. Nevertheless, exposure to volcanic ash can improve
   coral health and thus influence resilience to external stressors.},

Abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is a gas displaying multiple physiological functions
   in plants, animals and bacteria. The enzymes nitrate reductase and NO
   synthase have been suggested to be involved in the production of NO in
   plants and algae, but the implication of those enzymes in NO production
   under physiological conditions remains obscure. Symbiodinium
   microadriaticum, commonly referred to as zooxanthellae, is a marine
   microalga commonly found in symbiotic association with a cnidarian host
   including reef-building corals. Here we demonstrate NO production in
   zooxanthellae upon supplementation of either sodium nitrite or
   L-arginine as a substrate. The nitrite-dependent NO production was
   detected electrochemically and confirmed by the application of
   2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide
   (cPTIO), a specific NO scavenger. Cells stained with the
   diaminofluorescein, DAF-2 DA, an NO fluorescent probe, showed an
   increase in fluorescence intensity upon supplementation of both sodium
   nitrite and L-arginine. Microscopic observations of DAF-stained cells
   verified that NO was produced inside the cells. NO production in S.
   microadriaticum was found to increase upon exposure of cells to an acute
   heat stress which also caused a decline in the photosynthetic efficiency
   of PSII (F-v/F-m). This study provides substantial evidence to confirm
   that zooxanthellae can synthesize NO even when they are not in a
   symbiotic association with a coral host. The increase in NO production
   at high temperatures suggests that heat stress stimulates the microalgal
   NO production in a temperature-dependent manner. The implications of
   these findings are discussed in the light of the coral bleaching
   phenomenon which is associated with elevated sea surface temperature due
   to global warming.},

Abstract = {Hermatypic-zooxanthellate corals track the diel patterns of the main
   environmental parameters temperature, UV and visible light - by
   acclimation processes that include biochemical responses. The diel
   course of solar radiation is followed by photosynthesis rates and
   thereby elicits simultaneous changes in tissue oxygen tension due to the
   shift in photosynthesis/respiration balance. The recurrent patterns of
   sunlight are reflected in fluorescence yields, photosynthetic pigment
   content and activity of the two protective enzymes superoxide dismutase
   (SOD) and catalase (CAT), enzymes that are among the universal defenses
   against free radical damage in living tissue. All of these were
   investigated in three scleractinian corals: Favia favus, Plerogyra
   sinuosa and Goniopora lobata. The activity of SOD and CAT in the animal
   host followed the course of solar radiation, increased with the rates of
   photosynthetic oxygen production and was correlated with a decrease in
   the maximum quantum yield of photochemistry in Photosystem H (PSII)
   (Delta F'/F-m'). SOD and CAT activity in the symbiotic algae also
   exhibited a light intensity correlated pattern, albeit a less pronounced
   one. The observed rise of the free-radical-scavenger enzymes, with a
   time scale of minutes to several hours, is an important protective
   mechanism for the existence and remarkable success of the unique
   cnidarian-dinoflagellate associations, in which photosynthetic oxygen
   production takes place within animal cells. This represents a facet of
   the precarious act of balancing the photosynthetic production of oxygen
   by the algal symbionts with their destructive action on all living
   cells, especially those of the animal host.},

Abstract = {The correlation between solar radiation and sea surface temperature
   (SST) and growth was assessed along a latitudinal gradient. Extension
   rate and skeletal density were both correlated with calcification rate,
   indicating that calcium carbonate deposition was allocated evenly
   between skeletal density and linear extension. Unlike most studies on
   other tropical and temperate corals, in which calcification was
   positively correlated with solar radiation and SST, in the present study
   calcification was not correlated with solar radiation, whereas it was
   negatively correlated with SST. We hypothesize that photosynthesis of
   the symbiotic algae of Balanophyllia europaea is inhibited at high
   temperatures, consequently causing an inhibition of calcification. The
   regressions between calcification and SST predicted that the
   calcification of B. europaea would be depressed at 20.5-21.0 degrees C
   mean annual SST. The scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change conclude that by 2100, SST will exceed this physiological
   threshold for most of the populations considered in this study. This
   study comprises the first field investigation of the relationships
   between environmental parameters and calcification of a Mediterranean
   coral and highlights the risks of losing Mediterranean marine
   biodiversity over the course of future decades.},

Title = {ATP Supply May Contribute to Light-Enhanced Calcification in Corals More
   Than Abiotic Mechanisms},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Zooxanthellate corals are known to increase calcification rates when
   exposed to light, a phenomenon called light-enhanced calcification that
   is believed to be mediated by symbionts' photosynthetic activity. There
   is controversy over the mechanism behind this phenomenon, with
   hypotheses coarsely divided between abiotic and biologically-mediated
   mechanisms. At the same time, accumulating evidence shows that
   calcification in corals relies on active ion transport to deliver the
   skeleton building blocks into the calcifying medium, making it is an
   energetically costly activity. Here we build on generally accepted
   conceptual models of the coral calcification machinery and conceptual
   models of the energetics of coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis to develop a
   model that can be used to isolate the biologically-mediated and abiotic
   effects of photosynthesis, respiration, temperature, and seawater
   chemistry on coral calcification rates and related metabolic costs. We
   tested this model on data from the Mediterranean scleractinian Cladocora
   caespitosa, an acidification resistant species. We concluded that most
   of the variation in calcification rates due to photosynthesis,
   respiration and temperature can be attributed to biologically-mediated
   mechanisms, in particular to the ATP supplied to the active ion
   transports. Abiotic effects are also present but are of smaller
   magnitude. Instead, the decrease in calcification rates caused by
   acidification, albeit small, is sustained by both abiotic and
   biologically-mediated mechanisms. However, there is a substantial extra
   cost of calcification under acidified conditions. Based on these
   findings and on a literature review we suggest that the energy aspect of
   coral calcification might have been so far underappreciated.},

   explains annual changes in coral productivity},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUL 10},
Abstract = {The potential effects of seasonal acclimatization on coral sensitivity
   to heat-stress, has received limited attention despite differing
   bleaching thresholds for summer and winter. In this study, we examined
   the response of two contrasting phenotypes, termed winter and summer, of
   four Caribbean reef corals to similar light and heat-stress levels. The
   four species investigated were categorized into two groups: species with
   the ability to harbour large number of symbionts, Orbicella annularis
   and O. faveolata, and species with reduced symbiont density (Montastraea
   cavernosa and Pseudodiploria strigosa). The first group showed higher
   capacity to enhance photosynthetic rates per area (Pmax), while Pmax
   enhancement in the second group was more dependent on Symbiodinium
   performance (Psym). In summer all four species presented higher
   productivity, but also higher sensitivity to lose coral photosynthesis
   under heat-stress. In contrast, corals in winter exhibit symbionts with
   higher capacity to photoacclimate to the increased levels of light-
   stress elicited by heat-stress. Overall, our study supports the
   importance of the acclimatory coral condition in addition to the
   previous thermal history, to determine the severity of the impact of
   heat- stress on coral physiology, but also the dependence of this
   response on the particular structural and functional traits of the
   species.},

Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {This study explored the interactive effects of near-term CO2 increases
   (40-90 ppm above current ambient) during a simulated bleaching event (34
   A degrees C for 5 d) of Acropora aspera by linking physiology to
   expression patterns of genes involved in carbon metabolism. Symbiodinium
   photosynthetic efficiency (F (v) /F (m) ) was significantly depressed by
   the bleaching event, while elevated pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) slightly
   mitigated the effects of increased temperature on F (v) /F (m) during
   the final 4 d of the recovery period, however, did not affect the loss
   of symbionts. Elevated pCO(2) alone had no effect on F (v) /F (m) or
   symbiont density. Expression of targeted Symbiodinium genes involved in
   carbon metabolism and heat stress response was not significantly altered
   by either increased temperature and/or CO2. Of the selected host genes,
   two carbonic anhydrase isoforms (coCA2 and coCA3) exhibited the largest
   changes, most notably in crossed bleaching and elevated pCO(2)
   treatments. CA2 was significantly down-regulated on day 14 in all
   treatments, with the greatest decrease in the crossed treatment
   (relative expression compared to control = 0.16; p < 0.05); CA3 showed a
   similar trend, with expression levels 0.20-fold of controls on day 14 (p
   < 0.05) in the elevated temperature/pCO(2) treatment. The synergistic
   effects of ocean acidification and bleaching were evident during this
   study and demonstrate that increased pCO(2) in surface waters will
   impact corals much sooner than many studies utilising end-of-century
   pCO(2) concentrations would indicate.},

Title = {High salinity conveys thermotolerance in the coral model Aiptasia},
Journal = {BIOLOGY OPEN},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {The endosymbiosis between dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium
   and stony corals provides the foundation of coral reef ecosystems. Coral
   bleaching, the expulsion of endosymbionts from the coral host tissue as
   a consequence of heat or light stress, poses a threat to reef ecosystem
   functioning on a global scale. Hence, a better understanding of the
   factors contributing to heat stress susceptibility and tolerance is
   needed. In this regard, some of the most thermotolerant corals live in
   particularly saline habitats, but possible effects of high salinity on
   thermotolerance in corals are anecdotal. Here we test the hypothesis
   that high salinity may lead to increased thermotolerance. We conducted a
   heat stress experiment at low, intermediate, and high salinities using a
   set of hostendosymbiont combinations of the coral model Aiptasia. As
   expected, all host-endosymbiont combinations showed reduced
   photosynthetic efficiency and endosymbiont loss during heat stress, but
   the severity of bleaching was significantly reduced with increasing
   salinities for one of the host-endosymbiont combinations. Our results
   show that higher salinities can convey increased thermotolerance in
   Aiptasia, although this effect seems to be dependent on the particular
   host strain and/or associated symbiont type. This finding may help
   explain the extraordinarily high thermotolerance of corals in high
   salinity environments, such as the Red Sea and the Persian/Arabian Gulf,
   and provides novel insight regarding factors that contribute to
   thermotolerance. Since our results are based on a salinity effect in
   symbiotic sea anemones, it remains to be determined whether this
   salinity effect can also be observed in stony corals.},

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In many cases, understanding species' responses to climate change
   requires understanding variation among individuals in response to such
   change. For species with strong symbiotic relationships, such as many
   coral reef species, genetic variation in symbiont responses to
   temperature may affect the response to increased ocean temperatures. To
   assess variation among symbiont genotypes, we examined the population
   dynamics and physiological responses of genotypes of Breviolum
   antillogorgium in response to increased temperature. We found broad
   temperature tolerance across genotypes, with all genotypes showing
   positive growth at 26, 30, and 32 degrees C. Genotypes differed in the
   magnitude of the response of growth rate and carrying capacity to
   increasing temperature, suggesting that natural selection could favor
   different genotypes at different temperatures. However, the historical
   temperature at which genotypes were reared (26 or 30 degrees C) was not
   a good predictor of contemporary temperature response. We found
   increased photosynthetic rates and decreased respiration rates with
   increasing contemporary temperature, and differences in physiology among
   genotypes, but found no significant differences in the response of these
   traits to temperature among genotypes. In species with such broad
   thermal tolerance, selection experiments on symbionts outside of the
   host may not yield results sufficient for evolutionary rescue from
   climate change.},

Abstract = {Although prior exposure to high light is reported to make the coral
   Goniastrea aspera more tolerant to bleaching, effects of prior exposure
   to high temperature have not been studied. We examined the influence of
   prior exposure to high temperature on the photoinhibition-sensitivity of
   photosynthetic activity in the zooxanthellae of two
   bleaching-susceptible corals, Stylophora pistillata and Montipora
   digitata, and two bleaching-tolerant corals, Pachyseris rugosa and
   Pavona divaricata from Okinawa, Japan. Coral fragments were acclimated
   either at 24 or 31degreesC for 5 days, and then exposed to high light
   (1,200 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1)) for 2 h at 24 or 31degreesC.
   Bleaching-susceptible species acclimated at 31degreesC showed
   significant increase in photosynthetic activity (P-max) and total
   chlorophyll content, while bleaching-tolerant species showed the
   opposite pattern. The rate of dark respiration (R) was significantly
   higher in fragments acclimated at 31degreesC than in those acclimated at
   24degreesC in all investigated coral species. F-v/F-m decreased to a
   similar extent after high light treatment at 31degreesC in corals
   acclimated at 24 and 31degreesC in both tolerant and susceptible
   species. Pmax and chlorophyll content of bleaching-susceptible corals
   showed a more pronounced decline after high light exposure at 31degreesC
   than those of bleaching-tolerant species. The extent of reduction in
   P-max and chlorophyll content was significantly higher in fragments of
   S. pistillata and M. digitata acclimated at 31degreesC than in those
   acclimated at 24degreesC. Significant decrease in R was evident only in
   susceptible species acclimated at 31degreesC and exposed to high light
   at 31degreesC. These results suggest that mechanisms underlying the
   thermal acclimation of photosynthesis vary with coral species. A high
   photosynthetic acclimation potential to temperature might be associated
   with a response of P-max but not F-v/F-m. Susceptibility of S.
   pistillata and M. digitata to synergistic effects of high light and
   elevated temperature depends on a decreased capacity of their
   zooxanthellae to cope with photodamage, although the role of the host
   can not be excluded.},

Abstract = {Changes in land use and water management practices in south Florida have
   altered the quality and quantity of freshwater flowing into Florida Bay.
   By the 1980s, reduced inflow and drought led to an extensive hypersaline
   phase in the bay. This phase had a drastic effect on benthic communities
   within the bay and possibly also on coral communities within the bay and
   the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Physical oceanographic
   measurements demonstrate the presence of warm, hypersaline, and turbid
   water on coral reefs offshore from the Florida Keys, especially near
   passes which conduct water from Florida Bay to the Atlantic Ocean.
   To examine the effect of Florida Bay water intrusions on coral reefs, we
   tested for significant effects of two stressors, elevated temperature
   and salinity, on coral production, respiration, and survival. Elevated
   temperatures produce significant reductions in photosynthesis,
   respiration, and net P:R ratios after 6 h of exposure, and elevated
   salinities produce similar results after 30 h. Exposure to both elevated
   temperature and salinity produces a highly significant (P > 0.01), but
   short-term, mitigative interactive effect. The combination of the two
   stressors was less stressful (for the response variables measured) than
   the sum of the stressors acting independently. After 36 h of exposure,
   however, the mitigating effect disappeared and corals exposed to the
   combined stresses did not survive. A three-dimensional response surface,
   which predicts P: R ratios as a function of varying salinity and
   temperature, is used to construct a testable hypothesis to explain
   recent declines in coral cover on some reefs within Florida Bay and the
   Florida Keys. We chose salinity and temperature to test a multiple
   stressor model because they are relatively easy to manipulate. However,
   any environmentally realistic model must include other potential
   stressors, such as turbidity, elevated nutrients, and environmental
   contaminants.},

Abstract = {Functional traits define species by their ecological role in the
   ecosystem. Animals themselves are host-microbe ecosystems (holobionts),
   and the application of ecophysiological approaches can help to
   understand their functioning. In hard coral holobionts, communities of
   dinitrogen (N-2)-fixing prokaryotes (diazotrophs) may contribute a
   functional trait by providing bioavailable nitrogen (N) that could
   sustain coral productivity under oligotrophic conditions. This study
   quantified N-2 fixation by diazotrophs associated with four genera of
   hermatypic corals on a northern Red Sea fringing reef exposed to high
   seasonality. We found N-2 fixation activity to be 5- to 10-fold higher
   in summer, when inorganic nutrient concentrations were lowest and water
   temperature and light availability highest. Concurrently, coral gross
   primary productivity remained stable despite lower Symbiodinium
   densities and tissue chlorophyll a contents. In contrast, chlorophyll a
   content per Symbiodinium cell increased from spring to summer,
   suggesting that algal cells overcame limitation of N, an essential
   element for chlorophyll synthesis. In fact, N-2 fixation was positively
   correlated with coral productivity in summer, when its contribution was
   estimated to meet 11\% of the Symbiodinium N requirements. These results
   provide evidence of an important functional role of diazotrophs in
   sustaining coral productivity when alternative external N sources are
   scarce.},

Abstract = {Although coral species exhibit differential susceptibility to stressors,
   little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here we
   compared scleractinian corals Montipora peltiformis and Platygyra
   carnosa collected during the 2017 El Nin??o heat wave. Zooxanthellae
   density and chlorophyll a content declined and increased substantially
   during and after heat stress event, respective. However, the magnitude
   of change was larger in M. peltiformis. Transcriptome analysis showed
   that heat-stressed corals corresponded to metabolic depression and
   catabolism of amino acids in both hosts which might promote their
   survival. However, only M. peltiformis has developed the bleached coral
   phenotype with corresponding strong stress- and immune-related responses
   in the host and symbiont, and strong suppression of
   photosynthesis-related genes in the symbiont. Overall, our study reveals
   differences among species in the homeostatic capacity to prevent the
   development of the bleached phenotype under environmental stressors,
   eventually determining their likelihood of survival in the warming
   ocean.},

Abstract = {There is growing evidence that different coral species and algal
   symbionts (Symbiodinium spp.) can vary greatly in their response to
   rising temperatures and also ocean acidification. In a fully crossed
   factorial experimental design, two threatened Caribbean reef-building
   coral species, Acropora cervicornis hosting a mixture of Symbiodinium
   clades A and C and Orbicella faveolata hosting Symbiodinium D, were
   exposed to combinations of a normal (26 degrees C) and elevated (32
   degrees C) temperature and normal (380 ppm) and elevated (800 ppm) CO2
   for 62 d and then recovered at 26 degrees C and 380 ppm or 32 degrees C
   and 380 ppm for an additional 56 d. CO2 enrichment did not confer
   enhanced thermal tolerance as had been suggested in other studies. A.
   cervicornis was more sensitive to heat stress (maximum monthly mean +
   1.5 degrees C) experiencing 100\% mortality after 25 d while all O.
   faveolata survived. Conversely, O. faveolata was more sensitive to high
   CO2 experiencing a 47\% reduction in growth while A. cervicornis
   experienced no significant reduction. It is predicted that A.
   cervicornis is unlikely to survive past 2035. O. faveolata with D
   symbionts might survive to 2060 and later but its abundance will be
   impacted by CO2 effects on recruitment potential.},

Title = {Light is an active contributor to the vital effects of coral skeleton
   proxies},
Journal = {GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {140},
Pages = {671-690},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Symbiotic colonies of the coral Acropora sp. were cultured in a
   factorial design of three temperatures (21, 25 and 28 degrees C) and two
   light intensities (200 and 400 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1)), under
   constant conditions. A temperature of 25 degrees C and a light intensity
   of 200 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1) was the starting culture condition.
   Metabolic (photosynthesis, respiration, calcification and surface
   expansion rate) and geochemical measurements (delta O-18, delta C-13,
   Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca) were conducted on 6 colonies for each experimental
   condition. Metabolic measurements confirmed that respiration,
   photosynthesis, calcification and surface expansion rate responded to
   the combined effect of temperature and light. Under each light
   intensity, mean calcification rate was linearly correlated with mean
   photosynthetic activity. Geochemical measurements were also influenced
   by temperature and, to a lesser degree, by light. All geochemical
   proxies measured on 6 nubbins showed a wide scattering of values,
   regardless of the environmental condition. Compared to the other
   proxies, delta O-18 exhibited a different behavior. It was the only
   proxy exhibiting temperature tracer behavior. However, while mean values
   of Sr/Ca, Mg/Ca and delta C-13 were well correlated, the correlation
   between the later and mean delta O-18 differed with light level. This
   suggests that both skeleton deposition and temperature oxygen
   fractionation differs according to light intensity. Overall, the effect
   of light on geochemical values seems to compromise the use of proxy
   calibrations solely based on temperature influence.
   Under high light conditions, the great amplitude shown by individual net
   photosynthesis is directly proportional to the highly variable
   zooxanthellae density. As light is affecting all of the proxies, we thus
   assume that the strong geochemical variability observed could be
   explained by various algae densities, each nubbin responding according
   to its zooxanthellae amount. Accordingly, we suggest that each
   symbiosome (the assemblage of few corallites with their symbionts)
   presents its own vital effect influence over time. Therefore, at a bulk
   sample scale, light could be considered as one of the major causes of
   what is commonly referred to as the `vital effect'. The meaning of delta
   O-18 calibration versus temperature established from distinct colonies
   differs from calibration calculated from samples collected following the
   growth axis of a single coral head.
   Finally, in order to quantitatively reconstruct climatic condition, we
   suggest a new paradigm based on the statistical treatment of the
   combination of time-series information from several proxies, all
   measured on the same sample from a continuous symbiosome. (C) 2014

   damicornis but absent from healthy corals. The bacterium was isolated in
   pure culture, characterized microbiologically, and shown to cause
   bleaching when it was inoculated onto healthy corals at 25degreesC. The
   pathogen was reisolated from the diseased tissues of the infected
   corals. The zooxanthella concentration in the bacterium-bleached corals
   was less than 12\% of the zooxanthella concentration in healthy corals.
   When P. damicornis was infected with V. coralliidyticus at higher
   temperatures (27 and 29degreesC), the corals lysed within 2 weeks,
   indicating that the seawater temperature is a critical environmental
   parameter in determining the outcome of infection. A large increase in
   the level of the extracellular protease activity of V. coralliilyticus
   occurred at the same temperature range (24 to 28degreesC) as the
   transition from bleaching to lysis of the corals. We suggest that
   bleaching of P. damicornis results from an attack on the algae, whereas
   bacterium-induced lysis and death are promoted by bacterial
   extracellular proteases. The data presented here support the bacterial
   hypothesis of coral bleaching.},

Abstract = {It has been proposed that corals with symbiotic algae (Symbiodinium)
   bleach under thermal stress due to temperature-dependent inactivation of
   the Rubisco protein that impairs CO2 uptake, causing a backlog of
   electrons that result in the formation of damaging Reactive Oxygen
   Species. We present a numerical model of this mechanism of
   photoinhibition for symbiotic algae residing within coral tissue. The
   resulting rate of bleaching depended on temperature, light intensity,
   and the rate of heterotrophic feeding. The model was validated using
   three independently published experimental data sets. The model was
   capable of capturing both the diurnal change in the state of the
   photosystem, as well as changes in the symbiont population and the coral
   host caused by different temperature, light, and feeding treatments.
   Elevated temperatures and light led to a degradation of the photosystem
   and the expulsion of symbiont cells. If the coral fed heterotrophically,
   this degradation of the photosynthetic apparatus was reduced, but still
   a clear decrease in maximum quantum yield (F-v : F-m) and cell numbers
   was observed when the coral was exposed to elevated temperature. The
   reduction in chlorophyll content of cells at elevated temperatures and
   light was compared with the observational bleaching index Degree Heating
   Days (DHD). As quantified by DHD, the model was found to bleach under
   similar thermal stress regimes as field studies, except under elevated
   heterotrophic feeding conditions, which resulted in reduced severity of
   bleaching over a 90 d period.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are dominated by symbioses between marine invertebrates
   (e.g. corals, clams, sea anemones, sponges) and the dinoflagellate
   Symbiodinium. Increases in seawater temperature linked to global warming
   have lead to the phenomenon known as ``bleaching{''}, involving the
   disassociation of these symbioses and mass mortalities of the
   invertebrate host. Mass bleaching events have been linked to a thermal
   lesion in the photosynthesis of Symbiodinium, either at photosystem II
   or in the dark reactions of photosynthesis. Examination of two of the
   proposed lesion points, the carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM) and
   form II Rubisco, indicate that, over the temperature range examined, the
   CCM is not disrupted in Symbiodinium isolated from giant clams, however
   it was not possible to determine if Rubisco is the point of thermal
   lesion resulting in bleaching. Maximum photosynthetic rates were
   measured between 28 and 31degreesC and declined as temperature was
   increased. Despite a low correlation between Rubisco activity, oxygen
   evolution and temperature, Rubisco activity declined with increasing
   temperature.},

Title = {The implications of reduced metabolic rate in resource-limited corals},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {219},
Number = {6},
Pages = {870-877},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Many organisms exhibit depressed metabolism when resources are limited,
   a change that makes it possible to balance an energy budget. For
   symbiotic reef corals, daily cycles of light and periods of intense
   cloud cover can be chronic causes of food limitation through reduced
   photosynthesis. Furthermore, coral bleaching is common in present-day
   reefs, creating a context in which metabolic depression could have
   beneficial value to corals. In the present study, corals (massive
   Porites spp.) were exposed to an extreme case of resource limitation by
   starving them of food and light for 20 days. When resources were
   limited, the corals depressed area-normalized respiration to 37\% of
   initial rates, and coral biomass declined to 64\% of initial amounts,
   yet the corals continued to produce skeletal mass. However, the declines
   in biomass cannot account for the declines in area-normalized
   respiration, as mass-specific respiration declined to 30\% of the first
   recorded time point. Thus, these corals appear to be capable of
   metabolic depression. It is possible that some coral species are better
   able to depress metabolic rates than others; such variation could
   explain differential survival during conditions that limit resources
   (e.g. shading). Furthermore, we found that maintenance of existing
   biomass, in part, supports the production of skeletal mass. This
   association could be explained if maintenance supplies needed energy
   (e.g. ATP) or inorganic carbon (i.e. CO2) that otherwise limits the
   production of skeletal mass. Finally, the observed metabolic depression
   can be explained as a change in pool sizes, and does not require a
   change in metabolic rules.},

Abstract = {Vibrio shiloi is the first and well-documented bacterium which causes
   coral bleaching, particularly, during summer, when seawater temperature
   is between 26 and 31A degrees C. Coral bleaching is the disruption of
   the symbiotic association between coral hosts and their photosynthetic
   microalgae zooxanthellae. This is either due to lowered resistance in
   corals to infection or increased virulence of the bacterium at the
   higher sea surface temperature. The concentration of the oxygen and
   resulting oxygen radicals produced by the zooxanthellae during
   photosynthesis are highly toxic to bacteria, which also assist corals in
   resisting the infection. Hence, in this study we examined the effect of
   different temperatures on the activity of a novel extracellular SOD in
   V. shiloi. We also partially characterized the SOD and clearly confirmed
   that the extracellular SOD produced by V. shiloi is Mn-SOD type, as it
   was not inhibited by H2O2 or KCN. Performing chemical susceptibility
   killing assay, we confirmed that extracellular SOD may act as first line
   of defense for the bacteria against the reactive oxygen species. Since,
   increased activity of novel Mn-SOD at higher temperature, leads to the
   neutralization of radical toxicity and facilitates the survival of V.
   shiloi. Hence, the extracellular Mn-SOD may be considered as a virulence
   factor.},

Abstract = {Thermal priming of reef corals can enhance their heat tolerance;
   however, the legacy effects of heat stress during parental brooding on
   larval resilience remain understudied. This study investigated whether
   preconditioning adult coral Pocillopora damicornis to high temperatures
   (29 degrees C and 32 degrees C) could better prepare their larvae for
   heat stress. Results showed that heat-acclimated adults brooded larvae
   with reduced symbiont density and shifted thermal performance curves.
   Reciprocal transplant experiments demonstrated higher bleaching
   resistance and better photosynthetic and autotrophic performance in
   heat-exposed larvae from acclimated adults compared to unacclimated
   adults. RNA-seq revealed strong cellular stress responses in larvae from
   heat-acclimated adults that could have been effective in rescuing host
   cells from stress, as evidenced by the widespread upregulation of genes
   involved in cell cycle and mitosis. For symbionts, a molecular
   coordination between light harvesting, photoprotection and carbon
   fixation was detected in larvae from heat-acclimated adults, which may
   help optimize photosynthetic activity and yield under high temperature.
   Furthermore, heat acclimation led to opposing regulations of symbiont
   catabolic and anabolic pathways and favoured nutrient translocation to
   the host and thus a functional symbiosis. Notwithstanding, the improved
   heat tolerance was paralleled by reduced light-enhanced dark
   respiration, indicating metabolic depression for energy saving. Our
   findings suggest that adult heat acclimation can rapidly shift thermal
   tolerance of brooded coral larvae and provide integrated physiological
   and molecular evidence for this adaptive plasticity, which could
   increase climate resilience. However, the metabolic depression may be
   maladaptive for long-term organismal performance, highlighting the
   importance of curbing carbon emissions to better protect corals.},

Abstract = {The synergistic effect of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and a polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) was tested on the coral Porites divaricata.
   Small branches were incubated in different concentrations of
   fluoranthene followed by exposure to ecologically relevant levels of
   natural solar radiation, with and without UVR. Exposure to the highest
   concentration of fluoranthene (60 mu g L-1) resulted in decreased
   photochemical efficiency of corals exposed concomitantly to UVR but not
   in corals exposed to 60 mu g L-1 fluoranthene without UVR. After 6 days,
   most coral samples that were exposed to fluoranthene and UVR bleached or
   died (78\%) on the upper side of the branches. At 60 mu g L-1
   fluoranthene with UVR, 11 out of 12 samples died and the remaining
   sample bleached, much greater than the number of samples that bleached
   in manipulation or solvent controls. On the under side of the same
   samples, where the coral polyps are naturally protected from UVR, 11 out
   of 12 samples remained healthy and intact. The high UVR doses that
   shallow water dwelling corals receive combined with the results of this
   study show that photoinduced toxicity of PAHs is a stress factor that
   needs to be studied in more detail in coral reef ecosystems.},

Title = {Ocean acidification elicits differential bleaching and gene expression

Abstract = {The successful dispersal of coral larvae is vital to the population
   replenishment and reef recovery and resilience. De -spite that this
   critical early stage is susceptible to ocean warming and acidification,
   little is known about the responses of coral larvae to warming and
   acidification across different biological scales. This study explored
   the influences of el-evated temperature (29 ? versus 33 ?) and pCO2 (500
   mu atm versus 1000 mu atm) on brooded larvae of Pocillopora damicornis
   at the organismal, cellular and gene expression levels. Heat stress
   caused bleaching, depressed light-enhanced dark respiration,
   photosynthesis and autotrophy, whereas high pCO(2) stimulated
   photosynthesis. Although survival was unaffected, larvae at 33 ? were
   ten-times more likely to settle than those at 29 ?, suggesting reduced
   capacity to disperse and differentiate suitable substrate. Remarkably,
   heat stress induced greater symbiont loss at am -bient pCO(2) than at
   high pCO(2), while cell-specific pigment concentrations of symbionts at
   33 \& DEG;C increased twofold under ambient pCO2 relative to high pCO(2)
   suggesting pCO(2)-dependent bleaching patterns. Considerable increases
   in activities of host antioxidants superoxide dismutase (SOD) and
   catalase (CAT) at 33 ? indicated oxidative stress, whereas lipid
   peroxidation and caspase activities were contained, thereby restraining
   larval mortality at 33 ?. Fur -thermore, the coral host mounted stronger
   transcriptional responses than symbionts. High pCO(2) stimulated host
   met-abolic pathways, possibly because of the boosted algal productivity.
   In contrast, host metabolic processes and symbiont photosystem genes
   were downregulated at 33 ?. Interestingly, the upregulation of
   extracellular matrix genes and glycosaminoglycan degradation pathway at
   33 ? was more evident under ambient pCO(2) than high pCO(2), suggesting
   compromised host tissue integrity that could have facilitated symbiont
   expulsion and bleaching. Our results provide insights into how coral
   larvae respond to warming and acidification at different levels of
   biological organization, and demonstrate that ocean acidification can
   mediate thermal bleaching and gene expression in coral larvae under heat
   stress.},

Abstract = {After three decades of coral research on the impacts of climate change,
   there is a wide consensus on the adverse effects of heat-stress, but the
   impacts of ocean acidification (OA) are not well established. Using a
   review of published studies and an experimental analysis, we confirm the
   large species-specific component of the OA response, which predicts
   moderate impacts on coral physiology and pigmentation by 2100
   (scenario-B1 or SSP2-4.5), in contrast with the severe disturbances
   induced by only +2 \& DEG;C of thermal anomaly. Accordingly, global
   warming represents a greater threat for coral calcification than OA. The
   incomplete understanding of the moderate OA response relies on
   insufficient attention to key regulatory processes of these symbioses,
   particularly the metabolic dependence of coral calcification on algal
   photosynthesis and host respiration. Our capacity to predict the future
   of coral reefs depends on a correct identification of the main targets
   and/or processes impacted by climate change stressors.},

Abstract = {Extensive coral bleaching Occurred intertidally in early August 2003 in
   the Capricorn Bunker group (Wistari Reef, Heron and One Tree Islands;
   Southern Great Barrier Reef). The affected intertidal coral had been
   exposed to unusually cold (minimum = 13.3degreesC; wet bulb temperature
   = 9degreesC) and dry winds (44\% relative humidity) for 2 d during
   predawn low tides. Coral bleached in the upper 10 cm of their branches
   and had less than 0.2 x 10(6) cell cm(-2) as compared with over 2.5 x
   10(6), Cell cm(-2) in nonbleached areas. Dark-adapted quantum yields did
   not differ between symbionts in bleached and nonbleached areas. Exposing
   symbionts to light, however, led to greater quenching of Photosystem 11
   in symbionts in the bleached coral. Bleached areas of the affected
   colonies had died by September 2003, with areas that were essentially
   covered by more than 80\% living coral decreasing to less than 10\%
   visible living coral cover. By January 2004, coral began to recover,
   principally from areas of colonies that were not exposed during low tide
   (i.e., from below dead, upper regions). These data highlight the
   importance of understanding local weather patterns as well as the
   effects of longer term trends in global climate.},

Abstract = {Ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 280-400nm) is one of the potential factors
   involved in the induction of coral bleaching, loss of the endosymbiotic
   dinoflagellate Symbiodinium or their photosynthetic pigments. However,
   little has been documented on its effects on the behavior and
   recruitment of coral larvae, which sustains coral reef ecosystems. Here,
   we analyzed physiological changes in larvae of the scleractinian coral
   Pocillopora damicornis and examined the photophysiological performance
   of the symbiont algae, following exposure to incident levels of UVR and
   subsequently observed the development of coral larvae. The endosymbiotic
   algae exhibited a high sensitivity to UV-B (295-320nm) during a 6h
   exposure, showing lowered photosynthetic performance per larva and per
   algal cell, whereas the presence of UV-A (320-395nm) significantly
   stimulated photosynthesis. UVR decreased chlorophyll a concentration
   only at higher surface temperature or at the higher doses or intensities
   of UVR. Correlations between UV-absorbing compound (UVAC) contents or
   UVR sensitivity and temperature were identified, implying that UVACs
   might act as a screen or antioxidants in Pocillopora damicornis larvae.
   Larvae reared under UVR exposures showed lower levels of survivorship,
   metamorphosis and settlement, with inhibition by UV-A being much greater
   than that caused by UV-B.},

Abstract = {Coral bleaching is intensifying with global climate change. Although the
   causes for these catastrophic events are well understood, the cellular
   mechanism that triggers bleaching is not well established. Our
   understanding of coral bleaching processes is hindered by the lack of
   robust methods for studying interactions between host and symbiont at
   the single-cell level. Here, we exposed coral explants to acute thermal
   stress and measured oxidative stress, more specifically, reactive oxygen
   species (ROS), in individual symbiont cells. Furthermore, we measured
   concentrations of dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) and
   dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) to elucidate the role of these compounds in
   coral antioxidant function. This work demonstrates the application of
   coral explants for investigating coral physiology and biochemistry under
   thermal stress and delivers a new approach to study host-symbiont
   interactions at the microscale, allowing us to directly link
   intracellular ROS with DMSP and DMSO dynamics.},

Abstract = {Bleaching in stony-corals is the result of disruption of symbiosis
   between the coral hosts and photosynthetic microalgal endosymbionts
   (zooxanthellae). Coral bleaching events of unprecedented frequency and
   global extent have been reported during the last two decades. Recently,
   we demonstrated that bleaching of the coral Oculina patagonica in the
   Mediterranean Sea is caused by the bacterium Vibrio shiloi, when
   seawater temperature rises and allows the bacterium to become virulent.
   The first step in the infection process is host-specific adhesion of V.
   shiloi to O. patagonica via a beta-galactoside receptor on the coral
   surface. The bacterium then penetrates into the coral tissue and
   produces extracellular materials which rapidly inhibit photosynthesis of
   zooxanthellae and bleach and lyse the algae. The inhibition of
   pothosynthesis is due to a low molecular weight, heat stable toxin and
   ammonia. Bleaching and lysis are due to a heat-labile, high molecular
   weight materials, probably lytic enzymes. Elevated temperature induces
   different virulence factors within the infectious agent of the disease,
   V. shiloi. Adhesion was found to be temperature-regulated. When the
   bacteria were grown at 16 degrees C there was no adhesion to corals
   maintained at either 25 degrees C or 16 degrees. However, when the
   bacteria were grown at 25 degrees C they adhered avidly to corals
   maintained at 16 degrees C and 25 degrees C. In addition, the production
   of lytic enzymes and the photosynthesis inhibitor was also found to be
   temperature dependent. Production of the latter toxin was ten times
   greater at 29 degrees C than at 16 degrees C, and extracellular protease
   was 5-fold higher in cultures grown at 29 degrees C than at 16 degrees
   C. The data presented here suggest an explanation for the correlation
   between elevated seawater temperatures and seasonal coral bleaching.},

Abstract = {To survive in nutrient-poor waters corals rely on a symbiotic
   association with intracellular microalgae. However, increased sea
   temperatures cause algal loss-known as coral bleaching-often followed by
   coral death. Some of the most compelling evidence in support of the
   `oxidative stress theory of coral bleaching' comes from studies that
   exposed corals, cultures of their algal endosymbionts, or the coral
   model Exaiptasia diaphana to exogenous antioxidants during thermal
   stress. Here, we replicate these experiments using E.diaphana with the
   addition of the antioxidants ascorbate + catalase, catechin, or mannitol
   under ambient and elevated temperatures along with an antioxidant-free
   control. In the absence of exogenous antioxidants, E.diaphana exposed to
   elevated temperatures bleached with no change in reactive oxygen species
   (ROS) levels associated with their microalgal cells. Ascorbate +
   catalase and mannitol treatments rescued the anemones from bleaching,
   although microalgal ROS levels increased in these antioxidant treatments
   under elevated temperature conditions. While bleaching was not
   associated with changes in net ROS for the intracellular algal
   symbionts, it is evident from our findings that excess ROS is connected
   to the bleaching phenotype as exogenous antioxidants were successful in
   mitigating the effects of thermal stress in cnidarians. This
   understanding may assist applied research that aims to reduce the impact
   of climate change on coral reefs.},

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {31},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG 21},
Abstract = {The strontium-to-calcium ratio (Sr/Ca) of reef coral skeleton is an
   important tool for reconstructing past sea surface temperatures (SSTs).
   However, the accuracy of paleoSSTs derived from fossil coral Sr/Ca is
   challenged by evidence that physiological processes influence skeletal
   chemistry. Here we show that water level variations from tidal forcing
   are correlated with changes in coral Sr/Ca that cannot be accounted for
   by changes in SST. Ion microprobe measurements of Sr/Ca ratios in a
   Pacific Porites lutea reveal high-frequency variations at periods of
   similar to6, similar to10, and similar to25 days. The relationship
   between Sr/Ca and temperature on these short timescales does not follow
   trends observed at longer periods, indicating that an additional forcing
   is required to explain our observations. We demonstrate that Sr/Ca is
   correlated with both tidal water level variations and SST, and that
   their contributions to the Sr/Ca content of the skeleton vary as a
   function of period. We propose that water level influences Sr/Ca
   indirectly via modulation of photosynthetically-active radiation (PAR)
   that drives large changes in zooxanthellate photosynthesis.},

Title = {Extensive phenotypic plasticity of a Red Sea coral over a strong
   latitudinal temperature gradient suggests limited acclimatization
   potential to warming},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {Global warming was reported to cause growth reductions in tropical
   shallow water corals in both, cooler and warmer, regions of the coral
   species range. This suggests regional adaptation with less heat-tolerant
   populations in cooler and more thermo-tolerant populations in warmer
   regions. Here, we investigated seasonal changes in the in situ metabolic
   performance of the widely distributed hermatypic coral Pocillopora
   verrucosa along 12 degrees latitudes featuring a steep temperature
   gradient between the northern (28.5 degrees N, 21-27 degrees C) and
   southern (16.5 degrees N, 28-33 degrees C) reaches of the Red Sea.
   Surprisingly, we found little indication for regional adaptation, but
   strong indications for high phenotypic plasticity: Calcification rates
   in two seasons (winter, summer) were found to be highest at 28-29
   degrees C throughout all populations independent of their geographic
   location. Mucus release increased with temperature and nutrient supply,
   both being highest in the south. Genetic characterization of the coral
   host revealed low inter-regional variation and differences in the
   Symbiodinium clade composition only at the most northern and most
   southern region. This suggests variable acclimatization potential to
   ocean warming of coral populations across the Red Sea: high
   acclimatization potential in northern populations, but limited ability
   to cope with ocean warming in southern populations already existing at
   the upper thermal margin for corals.},

Title = {A new paradigm for δ<SUP>18</SUP>O in coral skeleton oxygen isotope
   fractionation response to biological kinetic effects},
Journal = {CHEMICAL GEOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {483},
Pages = {131-140},

Abstract = {This study investigated the relative impact of temperature and light on
   oxygen isotope fractionation in the aragonite of the symbiotic coral
   Acropora sp., which was cultured under controlled conditions. Aragonite
   was randomly sampled, and the oxygen isotopic composition (delta O-18)
   was analyzed at the micrometer scale. Measurements were collected from
   six cultured colonies using a factorial design of three temperatures (22
   degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 28 degrees C) and two light intensities
   (200 and 400 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1)). Observation of the newly formed
   skeletons revealed fibrous morphology. The delta O-18 distribution
   following a bin width of 0.25\% in histograms was bimodal. Because the
   colonies were cultured under constant environmental conditions, we
   suggest this bimodality in isotope distribution was caused by the
   diurnal cycle of 12 h light and 12 h dark that is necessary for coral
   health and to mimic natural conditions. We assume that the two modal
   values correspond to the two fractionation end members present in
   daytime and nighttime fibers. Then, we investigated the precipitation
   mechanism for each. In contrast to a common assumption, that the two
   fractionations are due to differences in pH created by more or less
   efficient Ca2+ pumping, we demonstrate that the pH at the calcification
   site cannot explain the isotopic discrepancy between daytime and
   nighttime and conclude that aragonite precipitation does not obey
   classical thermodynamic rules. We suggest that secretion of proteins by
   the calicoblastic layer, different following the diurnal cycle, can
   induce distinct biological kinetic processes. We highlight the interplay
   of carbonic anhydrase (CA) and organic molecules to accelerate and
   facilitate the crystallization of coral aragonite only governed by coral
   metabolism.},

Abstract = {Climate warming is occurring at a rate not experienced by life on Earth
   for 10s of millions of years, and it is unknown whether the
   coral-dinoflagellate (Symbiodinium spp.) symbiosis can evolve fast
   enough to ensure coral reef persistence. Coral thermal tolerance is
   partly dependent on the Symbiodinium hosted. Therefore, directed
   laboratory evolution in Symbiodinium has been proposed as a strategy to
   enhance coral holobiont thermal tolerance. Using a reciprocal transplant
   design, we show that the upper temperature tolerance and temperature
   tolerance range of Symbiodinium C1 increased after similar to 80 asexual
   generations (2.5 years) of laboratory thermal selection. Relative to
   wild-type cells, selected cells showed superior photophysiological
   performance and growth rate at 31 degrees C invitro, and performed no
   worse at 27 degrees C; they also had lower levels of extracellular
   reactive oxygen species (exROS). In contrast, wild-type cells were
   unable to photosynthesise or grow at 31 degrees C and produced up to 17
   times more exROS. In symbiosis, the increased thermal tolerance acquired
   ex hospite was less apparent. In recruits of two of three species
   tested, those harbouring selected cells showed no difference in growth
   between the 27 and 31 degrees C treatments, and a trend of positive
   growth at both temperatures. Recruits that were inoculated with
   wild-type cells, however, showed a significant difference in growth
   rates between the 27 and 31 degrees C treatments, with a negative growth
   trend at 31 degrees C. There were no significant differences in the rate
   and severity of bleaching in coral recruits harbouring wild-type or
   selected cells. Our findings highlight the need for additional
   Symbiodinium genotypes to be tested with this assisted evolution
   approach. Deciphering the genetic basis of enhanced thermal tolerance in
   Symbiodinium and the cause behind its limited transference to the coral
   holobiont in this genotype of Symbiodinium C1 are important next steps
   for developing methods that aim to increase coral bleaching tolerance.},

Abstract = {Successful reproductive output and recruitment is crucial to coral
   persistence and recovery following anthropogenic stress. Feeding is
   known to alter coral physiology and increase resilience to bleaching.
   The goal of the study was to address the knowledge gap of the influence
   of feeding on reproductive output and offspring phenotype. Colonies of
   Stylophora pistillata from the Northern Gulf of Aqaba (Red Sea) were fed
   an Artemia diet or unfed for 5 months during gametogenesis,
   fertilization, and brooding. In addition, time to settlement and
   mortality of planulae were assessed at water temperatures ranging from
   winter temperature (22 degrees C) to three degrees above average peak
   summer temperature (31 degrees C). A range of physiological parameters
   was measured in parents and offspring. In brooding parents, feeding
   significantly increased protein concentration and more than tripled the
   number of released planulae. Planulae from unfed colonies had higher
   chlorophyll per symbiont concentration and concomitantly higher
   photosynthetic efficiency compared to planulae from fed parents. In
   settlement assays, planulae showed a similar thermal resistance as known
   for this Red Sea adult population. Mortality was greater in planulae
   from unfed parents at ambient and 3 degrees C above ambient temperature
   despite higher per offspring investment in terms of total fatty acid
   content. Fatty acid profiles and relative abundances were generally
   conserved between different fed and unfed colonies but planulae were
   enriched in monounsaturated fatty acids relative to adults, that is,
   16:1, 18:1, 20:1, 22:1, and 24:1 isomers. Ultimately the availability of
   zooplankton could influence population physiology and recruitment in
   corals.},

Abstract = {Reef-building corals depend upon a nutritional endosymbiosis with
   photosynthetic dinoflagellates of the family Symbiodiniaceae for the
   majority of their energetic needs. While this mutualistic relationship
   is impacted by numerous stressors, warming oceans are a predominant
   threat to coral reefs, placing the future of the world's reefs in peril.
   Some Symbiodiniaceae species exhibit tolerance to thermal stress, but
   the in hospite symbiont response to thermal stress is underexplored. To
   describe the underpinnings of symbiosis and heat stress response, we
   compared in hospite and free-living transcriptomes of Durusdinium
   trenchii, a pan-tropical heat-tolerant Symbiodiniaceae species, under
   stable temperature conditions and acute hyperthermal stress. We
   discovered that symbiotic state was a larger driver of the
   transcriptional landscape than heat stress. The majority of
   differentially expressed transcripts between in hospite and free-living
   cells were downregulated, suggesting the in hospite condition is
   associated with the shutdown of numerous processes uniquely required for
   a free-living lifestyle. In the free-living state, we identified
   enrichment for numerous cell signalling pathways and other functions
   related to detecting and responding to a changing environment, as well
   as transcripts relating to mitosis, meiosis, and motility. In contrast,
   in hospite cells exhibited enhanced transcriptional activity for
   photosynthesis and carbohydrate transport as well as chromatin
   modifications and a disrupted circadian clock. Hyperthermal stress
   induced drastic alteration of transcriptional activity in hospite,
   suggesting symbiotic engagement with the host elicited an exacerbated
   stress response when compared to free-living D. trenchii. Altogether,
   the dramatic differences in gene expression between in hospite and
   free-living D. trenchii indicate the importance of considering symbiotic
   state in investigations of symbiosis and hyperthermal stress in
   Symbiodiniaceae.},

Title = {High salinity tolerance of the Red Sea coral <i>Fungia granulosa</i>
   under desalination concentrate discharge conditions: an <i>in situ</i>
   photophysiology experiment},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {1},
Abstract = {Seawater reverse osmosis desalination concentrate may have chronic
   and/or acute impacts on the marine ecosystems in the near-field area of
   the discharge. Environmental impact of the desalination plant discharge
   is supposedly site- and volumetric- specific, and also depends on the
   salinity tolerance of the organisms inhabiting the water column in and
   around a discharge environment. Scientific studies that aim to
   understand possible impacts of elevated salinity levels are important to
   assess detrimental effects to organisms, especially for species with no
   mechanism of osmoregulation, e.g., presumably corals. Previous studies
   on corals indicate sensitivity toward hypo- and hyper-saline
   environments with small changes in salinity already affecting coral
   physiology. In order to evaluate sensitivity of Red Sea corals to
   increased salinity levels, we conducted a long-term (29 days) in situ
   salinity tolerance transect study at an offshore seawater reverse
   osmosis (SWRO) discharge on the coral Fungia granulosa. While we
   measured a pronounced increase in salinity and temperature at the direct
   outlet of the discharge structure, effects were indistinguishable from
   the surrounding environment at a distance of 5 m. Interestingly, corals
   were not affected by varying salinity levels as indicated by
   measurements of the photosynthetic efficiency. Similarly, cultured coral
   symbionts of the genus Symbiodinium displayed remarkable tolerance
   levels in regard to hypo- and hypersaline treatments. Our data suggest
   that increased salinity and temperature levels from discharge outlets
   wear off quickly in the surrounding environment. Furthermore, F.
   granulosa seem to tolerate levels of salinity that are distinctively
   higher than reported for other corals previously. It remains to be
   determined whether Red Sea corals in general display increased salinity
   tolerance, and whether this is related to prevailing levels of high(er)
   salinity in the Red Sea in comparison to other oceans.},

Volume = {28},
Number = {7},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Climate change-related increase in seawater temperature has become a
   leading cause of coral bleaching and mortality. However, corals from the
   northern Red Sea show high thermal tolerance and no recorded massive
   bleaching event. This specific region is frequently subjected to intense
   dust storms, coming from the surrounding arid deserts, which are
   expected to increase in frequency and intensity in the future. The
   aerial dust deposition supplies essential bioelements to the water
   column. Here, we investigated the effect of dust deposition on the
   physiology of a Red Sea coral, Stylophora pistillata. We measured the
   modifications in coral and Symbiodiniaceae metallome (cellular metal
   content), as well as the changes in photosynthesis and oxidative stress
   status of colonies exposed during few weeks to dust deposition. Our
   results show that 1 mg L-1 of dust supplied nanomolar amounts of nitrate
   and other essential bioelements, such as iron, manganese, zinc and
   copper, rapidly assimilated by the symbionts. At 25 degrees C, metal
   bioaccumulation enhanced the chlorophyll concentration and
   photosynthesis of dust-exposed corals compared to control corals. These
   results suggest that primary production was limited by metal
   availability in seawater. A 5 degrees C increase in seawater temperature
   enhanced iron assimilation in both control and dust-enriched corals.
   Temperature rise increased the photosynthesis of control corals only,
   dust-exposed ones having already reached maximal photosynthesis rates at
   25 degrees C. Finally, we observed a combined effect of temperature and
   bioelement concentration on the assimilation of molybdenum, cadmium,
   manganese and copper, which were in higher concentrations in symbionts
   of dust-exposed corals maintained at 30 degrees C. All together these
   observations highlight the importance of dust deposition in the supply
   of essential bioelements, such as iron, to corals and its role in
   sustaining coral productivity in Red Sea reefs.},

Title = {Internal carbonic anhydrase activity in the tissue of scleractinian
   corals is sufficient to support proposed roles in photosynthesis and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {218},
Number = {13},
Pages = {2039-2048},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Reef-building corals import inorganic carbon (Ci) to build their calcium
   carbonate skeletons and to support photosynthesis by the symbiotic algae
   that reside in their tissue. The internal pathways that deliver Ci for
   both photosynthesis and calcification are known to involve the enzyme
   carbonic anhydrase (CA), which interconverts CO2 and HCO3-. We have
   developed a method for absolute quantification of internal CA (iCA)
   activity in coral tissue based on the rate of O-18-removal from labeled
   Ci. The method was applied to three Caribbean corals (Orbicella
   faveolata, Porites astreoides and Siderastrea radians) and showed that
   these species have similar iCA activities per unit surface area, but
   that S. radians has similar to 10-fold higher iCA activity per unit
   tissue volume. A model of coral Ci processing shows that the measured
   iCA activity is sufficient to support the proposed roles for iCA in Ci
   transport for photosynthesis and calcification. This is the case even
   when iCA activity is homogeneously distributed throughout the coral, but
   the model indicates that it would be advantageous to concentrate iCA in
   the spaces where calcification (the calcifying fluid) and photosynthesis
   (the oral endoderm) take place. We argue that because the rates of
   photosynthesis and calcification per unit surface area are similar among
   the corals studied here, the areal iCA activity used to deliver Ci for
   these reactions should also be similar. The elevated iCA activity per
   unit volume of S. radians compared with that of the other species is
   probably due to the thinner effective tissue thickness in this species.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {There is currently much debate about the ecological advantages for reef
   corals of hosting multiple types of the symbiotic dinoflagellate
   Symbiodinium. Amongst these is their apparent capacity to tolerate
   higher than normal water temperatures. There is strong photokinetic
   evidence that the trait of heat-tolerance in plants is accompanied by
   energetic tradeoffs but little such evidence yet exists for corals. We
   use rapid light curves (RLCs) to investigate the photokinetic basis for
   thermo-tolerance in the reef coral Acropora millepora with symbionts of
   contrasting thermal tolerance for which there are measured differences
   in energetics. Our results show that under non-stressful temperatures,
   corals with heat-tolerant type D Symbiodinium had a 41\% lower maximum
   relative electron transport rate (rETRmax) and lower light absorption
   efficiency (alpha) due to lower cell Chl a content compared with corals
   with heat-sensitive type C2 symbionts. Our results provide support for a
   photokinetic link between heat tolerance and deficits in holobiont
   (coral + symbiont) growth, lipid stores and reproduction. Reduced
   electron transport rate and light absorption capacity may be

Title = {Effect of photosynthetic light dosage on carbon isotope composition in
   the coral skeleton:: Long-term culture of <i>Porites</i> spp.},

Abstract = {Whereas the oxygen isotope ratio of the coral skeleton is used for
   reconstruction of past information on seawater, the carbon isotope ratio
   is considered a proxy for physiological processes, principally
   photosynthesis and respiration. However, the fractionation of carbon
   isotopes in biogenic carbonate such as coral skeleton is still unclear.
   We conducted a long-term culture experiment of Porites spp. corals at
   different light dosages ( light intensity, 100, 300, or 500 mu mol m(-2)
   s(-1); daily light period, 10 or 12 h) at 25 +/- 0.6 degrees C to
   examine the contribution of photosynthetic activity to skeletal carbon
   isotope composition. Corals were grown in sand-filtered seawater and not
   fed; thus, they subsisted from photosynthesis of symbiotic algae. As the
   daily dose of photosynthetically active radiation increased, the rate of
   annual extension also increased. Mean isotope compositions shifted; the
   carbon isotope compositions (delta C-13) became heavier and the oxygen
   isotope compositions ( delta O-18) became lighter at higher radiation
   dose. Skeletal delta O-18 decrease coincided with increasing skeletal
   growth rate, indicating the influence of so-called kinetic isotope
   effects. The observed delta C-13 increase should be subject to both
   kinetic and metabolic isotope effects, with the latter reflecting
   skeletal delta C-13 enrichment due to photosynthesis by symbiotic algae.
   Using a vector approach in the delta C-13 - delta O-18 plane, we
   discriminated between kinetic and metabolic isotope effects on delta
   C-13. The calculated delta C-13 changes from metabolic isotope effects
   were light dose dependent. The delta C-13 fractionation curve related to
   metabolic isotope effects is very similar to the photosynthesis -
   irradiance curve, indicating the direct contribution of photosynthetic
   activity to metabolic isotope effects. In contrast, delta C-13
   fractionation related to kinetic isotope effects gradually increased as
   the growth rate increased. Our experiment demonstrated that the kinetic
   and metabolic isotope effects in coral skeleton were successfully
   differentiated.},

Title = {Heat stress differentially impacts key calcification mechanisms in
   reef-building corals},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Number = {2},
Pages = {459-471},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Coral reefs are increasingly threatened by climate change, mass
   bleaching events and ocean acidification (OA). Coral calcification, a
   process that is critical to build and maintain the structure of tropical
   coral reefs, is highly sensitive to both warming and acidifying oceans.
   However, in contrast to the impacts of OA on coral calcification,
   significant knowledge gaps remain regarding how coral biomineralization
   mechanisms are impacted by heat stress and bleaching. Using a combined
   physiological and geochemical approach, we investigated how a marine
   heatwave impacted coral symbiotic status (chlorophyll a, algal symbiont
   density), the carbonate chemistry of the coral calcifying fluid (via
   delta B-11 and B/Ca) and skeletal trace element composition in the
   branching coral Acropora aspera. Importantly, we recorded in situ
   temperature throughout the bleaching event and recovery as well as coral
   symbiotic status during peak bleaching and after 7 months of recovery.
   We show that heat-stressed Acropora corals continued to upregulate the
   pH of their calcifying fluid (cf); however, dissolved inorganic carbon
   upregulation inside the cf was significantly disrupted by heat stress.
   Similarly, we observed suppression of the typical seasonality in the
   trace element (TE) temperature proxies Sr/Ca, Mg/Ca, Li/Ca and Li/Mg,
   indicating disruption of important calcification mechanisms, Rayleigh
   fractionation and reduced growth rates. Anomalies in TE/Ca ratios were
   still observed 7 months after peak bleaching, even though algal symbiont
   densities and chlorophyll a concentrations were fully restored at this
   point. Interestingly, the biomineralization response to heat stress did
   not differ between thermally distinct reef habitats harbouring coral
   populations with different heat tolerance, nor between heat-stressed
   colonies with different severity of bleaching. Our findings suggest that
   coral biomineralization mechanisms in Acropora are highly sensitive to
   heat stress, showing similar patterns of biogeochemical stress response
   as other coral taxa.},

Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Coral bleaching, caused by the loss of brownish-colored dinoflagellate
   photosymbionts from the host tissue of reef-building corals, is a major
   threat to reef survival. Occasionally, bleached corals become
   exceptionally colorful rather than white. These colors derive from
   photoprotective green fluorescent protein (GFP)-like pigments produced
   by the coral host. There is currently no consensus regarding what causes
   colorful bleaching events and what the consequences for the corals are.
   Here, we document that colorful bleaching events are a recurring
   phenomenon in reef regions around the globe. Our analysis of temperature
   conditions associated with colorful bleaching events suggests that
   corals develop extreme coloration within 2 to 3 weeks after exposure to
   mild or temporary heat stress. We demonstrate that the increase of light
   fluxes in symbiontdepleted tissue promoted by reflection of the incident
   light from the coral skeleton induces strong expression of the
   photoprotective coral host pigments. We describe an optical feedback
   loop involving both partners of the association, discussing that
   themitigation of light stress offered by host pigments could facilitate
   recolonization of bleached tissue by symbionts. Our data indicate that
   colorful bleaching has the potential to identify local environmental
   factors, such as nutrient stress, that can exacerbate the impact of
   elevated temperatures on corals, to indicate the severity of heat stress
   experienced by corals and to gauge their post-stress recovery potential.},

Abstract = {Warming and changes in ocean carbonate chemistry alter marine coastal
   ecosystems at an accelerating pace. The interaction between these
   stressors has been the subject of recent studies on reef organisms such
   as corals, bryozoa, molluscs, and crustose coralline algae. Here we
   investigated the combined effects of elevated sea surface temperatures
   and pCO(2) on two species of photosymbiont-bearing coral reef
   Foraminifera: Heterostegina depressa (hosting diatoms) and Marginopora
   vertebralis (hosting dinoflagellates). The effects of single and
   combined stressors were studied by monitoring survivorship, growth, and
   physiological parameters, such as respiration, photochemistry (pulse
   amplitude modulation fluorometry and oxygen production), and chl a
   content. Specimens were exposed in flow-through aquaria for up to seven
   weeks to combinations of two pCO(2) (similar to 790 and similar to 490 A
   mu atm) and two temperature (28 and 31 A degrees C) regimes. Elevated
   temperature had negative effects on the physiology of both species.
   Elevated pCO(2) had negative effects on growth and apparent
   photosynthetic rate in H.depressa but a positive effect on effective
   quantum yield. With increasing pCO(2), chl a content decreased in H.
   depressa and increased in M. vertebralis. The strongest stress responses
   were observed when the two stressors acted in combination. An
   interaction term was statistically significant in half of the measured
   parameters. Further exploration revealed that 75 \% of these cases
   showed a synergistic (= larger than additive) interaction between the
   two stressors. These results indicate that negative physiological
   effects on photosymbiont-bearing coral reef Foraminifera are likely to
   be stronger under simultaneous acidification and temperature rise than
   what would be expected from the effect of each of the stressors
   individually.},

   resolution and 12 bit signal resolution, was analysed. II informs about
   the structure and function of photosystem 2 being at different
   physiological states established by adaptation to different irradiance
   and temperature. The test needs a measuring time in vivo of only 1 to 5
   s, and thus many samples can be analysed. The measurements can be done
   continuously even on a single cell in a test tube or on the reef. The
   reef foraminifers tested here were Amphistegina and Amphisorus, freshly
   collected in Mauritius. As a temperate foraminifer, Sorites from the
   Mediterranean Sea was tested. The cells are very sensitive to slight
   temperature changes (25 to 32 degrees C). The comparison showed that the
   more the foraminifers live in an environment with constant temperature
   the less they are able to respond to temperature changes and, thus, the
   less they can adapt. Rising the temperature increases in general the
   sensitivity to different stress factors, such as high irradiance, pH,
   CO2, etc. After the test series, the cells recovered fully and were kept
   in an aquarium for long time observation.},

Abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) may damage cellular components but may
   also contribute to signaling that mitigates damage. In this context, the
   role of ROS in the stress response that leads to coral bleaching was
   investigated in three series of experiments with octocorals Sarcothelia
   sp. and Sympodium sp. Using video and fluorescent microscopy, the first
   experiments examined ROS and symbiont migration. Colonies mildly
   stressed with increased temperature and light showed increases in both
   ROS and numbers of migrating symbionts compared with stress-free
   controls. Symbionts migrating in the gastrovascular lumen may escape
   programmed cell death and provide a reservoir of healthy symbionts once
   conditions return to normal. In the second series of experiments,
   colonies were mildly stressed with elevated temperature and light.
   During stress, treated colonies were incubated in seawater enriched with
   two concentrations of bicarbonate (1 and 3 mmol/L), while controls were
   incubated in normal seawater. Bicarbonate enrichment provides additional
   carbon for photosynthesis and at some concentrations diminished the ROS
   emissions of stressed colonies of Sympodium sp. and Sarcothelia sp. In
   all experiments, the latter species tended to exhibit more ROS.
   Sympodium sp. contains Cladocopium sp. symbionts, which are less
   tolerant of stress, while Sarcothelia sp. contains the more resistant
   Durusdinium sp. Indeed, in direct comparisons, Sarcothelia sp.
   experienced higher levels of ROS under stress-free conditions and thus
   is conditioned to endure the stress associated with bleaching.
   Generally, ROS levels provide important insight into the cnidarian
   stress response and should be measured more often in studies of this
   response.},

Title = {Light effects on the isotopic fractionation of skeletal oxygen and

   implications for coral-growth rates},
Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {7},

Pages = {893-906},
Abstract = {Skeletal isotopic and metabolic measurements of the branching coral
   Acropora cultured in constant conditions and subjected to two light
   intensities were revisited. We individually compared the data recorded
   at low light (LL) and high light (HL) for 24 colonies, all derived from
   the same parent colony. Metabolic and isotopic responses to the
   different light levels were highly variable. High light led to
   productivity enhancement, reduction of surface extension, doubling of
   aragonite deposited weight and increased delta O-18 levels in all
   nubbins; responses in respiration and delta C-13 were not clear. The
   partitioning of the colonies cultured at HL into two groups, one showing
   a delta C-13 enrichment and the other a delta C-13 decrease revealed
   common behaviors. Samples showing an increase in delta C-13 were
   associated with the co-variation of low surface extension and high
   productivity while samples showing a decrease in delta C-13 were
   associated with the co-variation of higher surface extension and limited
   productivity.
   This experiment, which allowed for the separation of temperature and
   light effects on the coral, highlighted the significant light influences
   on both skeletal delta O-18 and delta C-13. The high scattering of
   inter-colony delta O-18 observed at one site could be due to the
   differing photosynthetic responses of symbiotic algal assemblages.
   We compared our results with observations by Gladfelter on Acropora
   cervicornis (1982). Both set of results highlight the relationships
   between coral-growth rates, micro-structures and photosynthetic
   activity. It appears that extension growth and skeleton thickening are
   two separate growth modes, and thickening is light-enhanced while
   extension is light-suppressed. There are multiple consequences of these
   findings for paleoclimatic reconstructions involving corals.},

Title = {δ<SUP>11</SUP>B, Sr, Mg and B in a modern <i>Porites</i> coral: the

Journal = {GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA},
Year = {2010},

Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Sr/Ca, B/Ca, Mg/Ca and delta B-11 were determined at high spatial
   resolution across similar to 1 year of a modern Hawaiian Porites lobata
   coral by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). We observe significant
   variations in B/Ca, Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and delta B-11 over short skeletal
   distances (nominally equivalent to periods of <20 days). This
   heterogeneity probably reflects variations in the composition of the
   extracellular calcifying fluid (ECF) from which the skeleton
   precipitates. Calcification site pH (total scale) was estimated from
   skeletal delta B-11 and ranged from 8.3 to 8.8 (+/- similar to 0.1) with
   a mean of similar to 8.6. Sr/Ca and B/Ca heterogeneity is not simply
   correlated with calcification site pH, as might be expected if Ca-ATPase
   activity increases the pH and decreases the Sr/Ca and B(OH)(4)(-)/CO32-
   ratios of the ECF. We produced a simple model of the ECF composition and
   the skeleton deposited from it, over a range of calcium transport and
   carbonate scenarios, which can account for these observed geochemical
   variations. The relationship between the pH and Sr/Ca of the ECF is
   dependent on the concentration of DIC at the calcification site. At
   higher DIC concentrations the ECF has a high capacity to buffer the
   {[}H+] changes induced by Ca-ATPase pumping. Conversely, at low DIC
   concentrations, this buffering capacity is reduced and ECF pH changes
   more rapidly in response to Ca-ATPase pumping. The absence of a simple
   correlation between ECF pH and skeletal Sr/Ca implies that calcification
   occurred under a range of DIC concentrations, reflecting variations in
   the respiration and photosynthesis of the coral and symbiotic
   zooxanthellate in the overlying coral tissues. Our observations have
   important implications for the use of coral skeletons as indicators of
   palaeo-occan pH. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Year = {2010},

Number = {1-2},
Pages = {27-33},
Month = {APR 30},
Abstract = {Zooxanthellate colonies of the scleractinian coral Astrangia poculata
   were grown under combinations of ambient and elevated nutrients (5 mu M
   NO3-, 0.3 mu M PO4-3, and 2 nM Fe+2) and CO2 (similar to 780 ppmv)
   treatments for a period of 6 months. Coral calcification rates,
   estimated from buoyant weights, were not significantly affected by
   moderately elevated nutrients at ambient CO2 and were negatively
   affected by elevated CO2 at ambient nutrient levels. However,
   calcification by corals reared under elevated nutrients combined with
   elevated CO2 was not significantly different from that of corals reared
   under ambient conditions, suggesting that CO2 enrichment can lead to
   nutrient limitation in zooxanthellate corals. A conceptual model is
   proposed to explain how nutrients and CO2 interact to control
   zooxanthellate coral calcification. Nutrient limited corals are unable
   to utilize an increase in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) as nutrients
   are already limiting growth, thus the effect of elevated CO2 on
   saturation state drives the calcification response. Under nutrient
   replete conditions, corals may have the ability to utilize more DIC,
   thus the calcification response to CO2 becomes the product of a negative
   effect on saturation state and a positive effect on gross carbon
   fixation, depending upon which dominates, the calcification response can
   be either positive or negative. This may help explain how the range of
   coral responses found in different studies of ocean acidification can be
   obtained. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Community dynamics and physiology of Symbiodinium associated with
   Orbicella (= Montastraea) faveolata were examined before, during, and
   after a thermally induced coral bleaching event in Puerto Morelos,
   Mexico. We combined microsampling molecular genotyping with in situ
   pulse-amplitude modulated fluorometry to correlate colony variability of
   Symbiodinium population identities and the phenomena of partial coral
   bleaching. Pigmented nonbleached portions of O. (= M.) faveolata were
   compared with bleached portions of the same colony. During bleaching,
   maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII; F-v : F-m) was
   significantly lower and highly variable (range 0.110 to 0.680) compared
   with previous summers in which coral bleaching was absent (range 0.516
   to 0.661) and recovery (range 0.480 to 0.716). Differential
   susceptibility to environmental perturbation of F-v : F-m corresponded
   to distinct genetic identities of Symbiodinium. Analysis of ribosomal
   deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2)
   revealed regions of the coral colonies that had phylotype A3 prior to
   bleaching were more resistant to the bleaching perturbation than
   adjacent bleaching-prone patches that harbored phylotypes B17 and C7.
   During environmental perturbation, regions of the colonies containing
   predominantly Symbiodinium phylotypes A3 or D1a retained significantly
   higher F-v : F-m values than adjacent regions with phylotypes B17 and
   C7. Following bleaching, rapid recovery of symbiotic algal densities
   greatly exceeded normal seasonal oscillations. During recovery we
   document shifts in Symbiodinium populations and increase prevalence of
   Symbiodinium types A3 and D1a, phylotypes known to have enhanced thermal
   tolerances. Thermal tolerance of Symbiodinium spp. influences the
   changes of coral-Symbiodinium communities during disturbance events and
   the dynamics of coral-Symbiodinium repopulation.},

Title = {A comparison of mesophotic and shallow sponge holobionts resilience to
   predicted future temperature elevation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 5},
Abstract = {Climate change is predicted to have detrimental impacts on sessile
   invertebrates, including sponges. Mesophotic ecosystems have been
   suggested to play a major role as refugia for coral reef sponge species,
   however knowledge regarding the ability of mesophotic sponges to cope
   with thermal stress is scarce. In this study we compared the response of
   the sponge Diacarnus erythraeanus, a widespread Red Sea sponge, from the
   shallow and mesophotic reef, to moderate and acute temperature elevation
   (2 degrees C and 6 degrees C, respectively) for short and long term
   periods (two and 35 days, respectively) by measuring physiological
   parameters (respiration, oxygen removal, pumping rates, and
   photosynthetic efficiency), and the microbiome composition change. The
   results indicated that mesophotic and shallow populations of D.
   erythraeanus are highly tolerant to both moderate and acute heat stress,
   demonstrating a high survival rate (100\%) across the experimental
   treatments, with no visible signs of bleaching or necrosis. Exposure to
   heat stress resulted in significant alterations in the physiological
   parameters of sponges, including higher respiration rate and lower
   photosynthetic efficiency. These alterations were accompanied by
   correspondingly significant microbial adjustments, thus emphasizing the
   essential role of the microbiome in the host's ability to persist when
   facing essential environmental stress. Moreover, while shallow and
   mesophotic sponges showed similar physiological tolerance to heat
   stress, their microbial response differed: while the microbiome
   diversity of the mesophotic sponges remained stable throughout the
   experiment, the shallow one significantly changed. This result suggests
   that their underlying coping mechanisms might differ between mesophotic
   and shallow populations. Since the associated-microbiome is largely
   regulated by the sponge-host genetics, difference in microbial
   adjustments to stress between populations, could indicate genetic
   variability between hosts. Therefore, while the results of this study
   support the hypothesis that mesophotic coral reefs could serve as
   thermal refugia for some sponge species, it raises the question
   regarding the validity of MCEs as a refuge for shallow populations.
   Finally, it emphasizes the crucial need to elucidate the underlying
   mechanisms governing the sponge-microbiome interactions, specifically in
   the context of the anticipated climate change scenarios.},

Abstract = {Large amplitude internal waves (LAIW) cause frequent and severe changes
   in the physico-chemical environment of Andaman Sea coral reefs and are a
   potentially important source of disturbance for corals. To explore the
   coral response to LAIW, prey capture disposition and photosynthesis were
   investigated in relation to changes in seawater temperature, pH, flow
   speed and food availability in LAIW simulation studies under controlled
   laboratory conditions, using Porites lutea as a model organism. Although
   food presence stimulated polyp expansion, we found an overriding effect
   of low temperature (19 degrees C) causing retraction of the coral polyps
   into their calices, particularly when pH was altered concomitantly.
   Decreases in pH alone, however, caused the expansion of the polyps. The
   exposure history of the colonies played a crucial role in coral
   responses: prior field exposure to LAIW yielded lower retraction levels
   than in LAIW-inexperienced corals, suggesting acclimatization. Low
   temperature (19 degrees C) exposure did not seem to influence the
   photosynthetic performance, but LAIW-experienced corals showed higher
   values of maximum dark-adapted quantum yield (F-v/F-m) of photosystem II
   than LAIW-inexperienced controls. Collectively, these data suggest that
   P. lutea, the dominant hermatypic coral in the Andaman Sea, can
   acclimatize to extreme changes in its abiotic environment by modulating
   its mixotrophic nutrition, through polyp expansion and potential
   feeding, as well as its photosynthetic efficiency.},

Abstract = {Coral skeletal boron geochemistry offers opportunities to probe the pH
   of the calcification media (pHCM) of modern and fossil specimens, to
   estimate past changes in seawater pH and to explore the
   biomineralisation response to future ocean acidification. In this
   research we grew 2 Stylophora pistillata coral microcolonies over glass
   coverslips to allow analysis of the pH sensitive dye SNARF-1, in the
   extracellular calcification medium at the growing edge of colonies where
   the first aragonite crystals are formed, under both light and dark
   conditions. We use secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) to measure the
   boron isotopic composition (811B) of the skeleton close to the growth
   edge after 2 to 3 days of additional calcification had enlarged the
   crystals until they joined, generating a continuous sheet of aragonite.
   Mean skeletal 811B-pHCM estimates are higher than those by SNARF-1 by
   0.35-0.44 pH units. These differences either reflect real variations in
   the pH of the calcification media associated with each measurement
   technique or indicate other changes in the biomineralisation process
   which influence skeletal 811B. SNARF-1 measures directly the pH of the
   extracellular calcification medium while skeletal 811B analyses
   aragonite potentially formed via both extracellular and intracellular
   biomineralisation pathways. Analysis of a third coral specimen, also
   growing on a glass slide but with a 5 cm long branch, indicated good
   agreement between the 811B value of the apex of the branch and the
   skeletal growth edge. The tissues overlying both these regions were
   transparent indicating they had low symbiont densities. This suggests
   that the biomineralisation process is broadly comparable between these
   sites and that studies growing corals over glass slides/coverslips
   provide representative data for the colony apex.},

Title = {Differing Responses of Three Scleractinian Corals from Phuket Coast in
   the Andaman Sea to Experimental Warming and Hypoxia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {An unprecedented decline in the diversity and health of coral reefs is
   occurring around the world as they are threatened by multiple global and
   local stressors. Rising seawater temperature and low dissolved oxygen
   (DO) conditions are expected to intensify as a result of climate change.
   Understanding the responses of corals to these stressors is necessary
   for making predictions and devising mitigation strategies. The three
   coral species-Porites lutea, Montipora tuberculosa, and Pocillopora
   verrucosa-were sampled from Patong Bay, Phuket, Thailand, as
   representatives of different coral morphologies. Coral nubbins were
   subjected to experimental investigation under ambient conditions (29
   degrees C, DO > 6 mgL(-1)), heat stress (32 degrees C), hypoxia (DO < 2
   mgL(-1)), and heat stress + hypoxia treatments. Photosynthetic
   performance indicators Fv/Fm and Fv/F0 and physiological parameters
   Symbiodiniaceae density, pigment concentration, and growth rate were
   quantified. We found P. verrucosa (branching) to be the most sensitive
   and severely affected by heat stress or hypoxia, more so than P. lutea
   (massive) and M. tuberculosa (tabular). The combination of these
   stressors had less impact on these species, except for a decline in
   growth rate of M. tuberculosa. This study also suggests that the corals
   respond differently to high temperature and low oxygen, with their
   sensitivity depending on species. These responses, however, may differ
   according to the lighting, especially in hypoxic conditions. The results
   fill a research gap to help predict the vulnerability of these three
   coral species in shallow reef habitats under climate change scenarios.},

Title = {The giant clam <i>Tridacna squamosa</i> quickly regenerates iridocytes
   and restores symbiont quantity and phototrophic potential to
   above-control levels in the outer mantle after darkness-induced
   bleaching},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Giant clams are ecologically and economically relevant reef inhabitants
   that host photosynthetic dinoflagellates inside tubules located mainly
   in their colorful outer mantle. This study examined the effects of
   exposure to darkness for 30 days and the subsequent 11 days of recovery
   under a normal photoperiod on the outer mantle of the fluted giant clam
   Tridacna squamosa. Changes in the abundance of iridocytes and symbionts
   were assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Light microscopy was applied
   to quantify symbionts isolated from the outer mantle, while chlorophyll
   was extracted and analyzed by spectroscopy. The transcript levels of the
   host's vacuolar-type H+-ATPase subunit A (ATP6V1A) and symbionts' form
   II ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Zoox-rbcII) were
   determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and used as proxies for
   iridocyte abundance and phototrophic potential, respectively. The
   protein abundance of ATP6V1A and Zoox-RBCII was quantified by western
   blotting. After exposure to darkness for 30 days, the outer mantle of T.
   squamosa individuals lost the distinct multiple color patterns, and the
   gene and protein expression levels of ATP6V1A/ATP6V1A and
   Zoox-rbcII/Zoox-RBCII decreased dramatically. Microscopy assessment
   confirmed the reduction in iridocyte and symbiont populations, and the
   chlorophyll level also decreased considerably. However, just 11 days
   after returning to a normal light:dark regimen, the quantity of coccoid
   dinoflagellates and the expression of Zoox-rbcII/Zoox-RBCII in the outer
   mantle increased significantly to levels higher than those of the
   individuals prior to exposure to darkness (control), while the
   chlorophyll content returned to the control level. Additionally, the
   outer mantle regained most of its coloration with partial recovery of
   the iridocyte population. These results are relevant not only for
   understanding the phenomena of light deprivation and symbiont loss in
   dinoflagellate-associated reef organisms, but also signify that the
   giant clam-coccoid dinoflagellate holobiont is phototrophically plastic
   and particularly tolerant to bleaching.},

Volume = {40},

Abstract = {Climate change is causing ocean temperature and partial pressure of
   carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) to increase. For sea anemones that have
   Symbiodiniaceae, high temperatures induce bleaching, whereas rises in
   pCO(2) can enhance photosynthesis and increase host growth and
   abundance. It is, however, not clear how the interaction of these two
   stressors impacts sea anemones that provide habitat for anemonefishes.
   Here, we investigated the bleaching response of the sea anemone
   Entacmaea quadricolor, under four conditions: (i) current temperature
   and current pCO(2) (control); (ii) future pCO(2); (iii) future
   temperature; and (iv) future temperature and future pCO(2). After 16
   days of exposure, future temperature, but not pCO(2) nor their
   interaction, significantly reduced the Symbiodiniaceae density and total
   chlorophyll Symbiodiniaceae cell(-1). Colour score was lower in the sea
   anemones exposed to future temperature than current temperature from day
   4 onwards. In contrast, total chlorophyll symbiont cell(-1) increased in
   the future temperature treatments, and light-adapted effective quantum
   yield remained similar in all treatments. Although pCO(2) had no impact
   within the time frame of our experiment, the predicted future
   temperature induced bleaching in E. quadricolor. As bleaching events
   increase in frequency and severity, this will likely impact the
   abundance of host sea anemones and their symbiotic anemonefishes.},

Abstract = {The early effects of heat stress on the photosynthesis of symbiotic
   dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae) within the tissues of a reef-building
   coral were examined using pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) chlorophyll
   fluorescence and photorespirometry. Exposure of Stylophora pistillata to
   33 and 34 degrees C for 4 h resulted in (1) the development of strong
   non-photochemical quenching (qN) of the chlorophyll fluorescence signal,
   (2) marked decreases in photosynthetic oxygen evolution, and (3)
   decreases in optimal quantum yield (F-v/F-m) of photosystern II (PSII),
   Quantum yield decreased to a greater extent on the illuminated surfaces
   of coral branches than on lower (shaded) surfaces, and also when high
   irradiance intensities were combined with elevated temperature (33
   degrees C as opposed to 28 degrees C), qN collapsed in heat-stressed
   samples when quenching analysis was conducted in the absence of oxygen,
   Collectively, these observations are interpreted as the initiation of
   photoprotective dissipation of excess absorbed energy as heat (qN) and
   O-2-dependent electron flow through the Mehler-Ascorbate-Peroxidase
   cycle (MAP-cycle) following the point at which the rate of light-driven
   electron transport exceeds the capacity of the Calvin cycle. A model for
   coral bleaching is proposed whereby the primary site of heat damage in
   S, pistillata is carboxylation within the Calvin cycle, as has been
   observed during heat damage in higher plants, Damage to PSII and a
   reduction in F-v/F-m (i.e. photoinhibition) are secondary effects
   following the overwhelming of photoprotective mechanisms by light. This
   secondary factor increases the effect of the primary variable,
   temperature. Potential restrictions of electron flow in heat-stressed
   zooxanthellae are discussed with respect to Calvin cycle enzymes and the
   unusual status of the dinoflagellate Rubisco, Significant features of
   our model are that (1) damage to PSII is not the initial step in the
   sequence of heat stress in zooxanthellae, acid (2) light plays a key
   secondary role in the initiation of the bleaching phenomena.},

Abstract = {The impact of elevated CO2 and temperature on photosynthesis and
   calcification in the symbiont-bearing benthic foraminifer Marginopora
   vertebralis was studied. Individual specimens of M. vertebralis were
   collected from Heron Island on the southern Great Barrier Reef
   (Australia). They were maintained for 5 weeks at different temperatures
   (28, 32 A degrees C) and pCO(2) (400, 1,000 A mu atm) levels spanning a
   range of current and future climate-change scenarios. The photosynthetic
   capacity of M. vertebralis was measured with O-2 microsensors and a
   pulse-amplitude-modulated chlorophyll (Chl) fluorometer, in combination
   with estimates of Chl a and Chl c (2) concentrations and calcification
   rates. After 5 weeks, control specimens remained unaltered for all
   parameters. Chlorophyll a concentrations significantly decreased in the
   specimens at 1,000 A mu atm CO2 for both temperatures, while no change
   in Chl c (2) concentration was observed. Photoinhibition was observed
   under elevated CO2 and temperature, with a 70-80 \% decrease in the
   maximum quantum yield of PSII. There was no net O-2 production at
   elevated temperatures in both CO2 treatments as compared to the control
   temperature, supporting that temperature has more impact on
   photosynthesis and O-2 flux than changes in ambient CO2. Photosynthetic
   pigment loss and a decrease in photochemical efficiency are thus likely
   to occur with increased temperature. The elevated CO2 and high
   temperature treatment also lead to a reduction in calcification rate
   (from +0.1 to >-0.1 \% day(-1)). Thus, both calcification and
   photosynthesis of the major sediment-producing foraminifer M.
   vertebralis appears highly vulnerable to elevated temperature and ocean
   acidification scenarios predicted in climate-change models.},

Title = {Detecting hyperthermal stress in larvae of the hermatypic coral
   <i>Porites astreoides</i>: the suitability of using biomarkers of
   oxidative stress versus heat-shock protein transcriptional expression},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Scleractinian coral populations are declining worldwide in response to a
   variety of factors including increases in sea surface temperatures. To
   evaluate the effects of predicted elevated seawater temperatures on
   coral recruitment, larvae from the coral Porites astreoides were exposed
   to seawater at ambient (27.3 A degrees C) or elevated temperature (30.8
   A degrees C) conditions for 4, 24, or 48 h. Following exposure, larvae
   were tested for survival and settlement, oxidative stress, respiratory
   demand, and mRNA expression of heat-shock proteins (Hsps) 16 and 60.
   While elevated temperature had no effect on larval survival, settlement,
   or expression of Hsps, it did cause a significant increase in larval
   respiration, oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation), and antioxidant
   enzyme activity (catalase). The absence of a significant up-regulation
   of Hsp 16 or 60 expression in response to thermal stress suggests that
   the transcriptional expression of these genes is a less sensitive
   diagnostic tool compared to biomarkers of oxidative stress at the
   temperatures examined. The results of this study provide evidence that
   enhanced levels of oxidative stress are encountered in
   zooxanthellae-containing coral larvae in response to elevated
   temperatures and that this occurrence should be strongly considered for
   use as a biomarker when monitoring sub-lethal cellular responses to
   rising sea surface temperatures.},

Title = {The effect of elevated temperature and substrate on free-living
   <i>Symbiodinium</i> cultures},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1},
Pages = {161-171},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Elevated temperatures can produce a range of serious, deleterious
   effects on marine invertebrate-Symbiodinium symbioses. The responses of
   free-living Symbiodinium to elevated temperature, however, have been
   little studied, especially in the context of their natural habitat. In
   this study, we investigated physiological responses of two Symbiodinium
   cultures to elevated temperature, an exclusively free-living ITS2 clade
   A (strain HI-0509) and the symbiosis-forming ITS2 type A1 (strain
   CCMP2467). Free-living Symbiodinium strains have recently been isolated
   from benthic sediments, and both cultures were therefore grown with or
   without a microhabitat of carbonate sediment at 25, 28 or 31 A degrees
   C. Maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (F (v)/F (m)) and specific
   growth rate were measured as response variables. In culture,
   Symbiodinium cells exhibit motility in a helical swimming pattern, and
   therefore, revolutions per minute (RPM) were also measured with video
   microscopy. The exclusively free-living clade A was physiologically
   superior to Symbiodinium A1 across all measured variables and treatment
   combinations. F (v)/F (m) remained relatively stable through time (at
   approximately 0.55) and was not substantially affected by temperature or
   the presence or the absence of sediment. Populations of the exclusively
   free-living Symbiodinium A reproduced faster with sediment than without
   and exhibited high levels of motility across all treatments (surpassing
   300 RPM). In contrast, the F (v)/F (m) of A1 dropped to 0.42 in sediment
   (relative to cultures without sediment) and exhibited dramatic declines
   in cell concentration, most severely at 31 A degrees C. A > 50 \%
   reduction in motility was also observed at 31 A degrees C. Even in the
   absence of sediment, elevated temperature was observed to reduce
   population growth and cell motility of type A1. We suggest that vital
   behaviours linked to motility (such as vertical migration and the
   locating of potential hosts) may become impaired during future thermal
   anomalies and that populations of Symbiodinium A1 may only live
   transiently in sediment or outside coral hosts. Such differences in
   physiology between distinct Symbiodinium types may represent adaptations
   that are either conserved or lost depending on the differing selection
   pressures that come with living in symbiosis or free in the environment.},

Abstract = {Larval dispersal and postsettlement survival of corals play significant
   roles in the maintenance of coral populations. Most corals acquire their
   symbiotic algae (Symbiodiniaceae) from the environment in each
   generation (horizontal transmission). For horizontal transmitters, the
   quick establishment of symbiosis is important for their survival, since
   the photosynthetic activity of symbiotic algae provides energy. However,
   recent studies have indicated that oxidative stress resulting from
   photosynthesis might also harm coral larvae. Therefore, it remains
   unclear whether symbionts contribute energy sources along with intrinsic
   lipids from eggs and assist in settlement/metamorphosis in early life
   stages. In the present study, we show that symbiotic algae contribute
   supplemental energy and are also associated with settlement.
   Furthermore, although juveniles acquired symbiotic algae after
   settlement, the acquisition of symbiotic algae in the larval stages
   caused higher growth (number of polyps and size) and low mortality in
   the juvenile stage. Our data suggest that symbiotic larvae potentially
   have longer dispersal periods due to their lower lipid consumption
   rates, which make them better able to retain buoyancy and motility,
   increasing the ability of symbiotic larvae to settle in favored
   locations compared with aposymbiotic larvae. Moreover, postsettlement
   juveniles may continue to benefit from symbiotic relationships formed
   during the larval stage. Overall, these findings reveal that the effects
   of symbiotic algae on Acropora tenuis coral larvae are beneficial,
   particularly under normal seawater temperature conditions.},

Abstract = {Sponges are major components of benthic communities across the world and
   have been identified as potential ``winners{''} on coral reefs in the
   face of global climate change as result of their tolerance to ocean
   warming and acidification (OA). Previous studies have also hypothesised
   that photosymbiont-containing sponges might have higher productivity
   under future OA conditions as a result of photosymbionts having
   increased access to CO2 and subsequently greater carbon production. Here
   we test this hypothesis for a widespread and abundant
   photosymbiont-containing sponge species Lamellodysidea herbacea at a CO2
   seep in Papua New Guinea simulating OA conditions. We found seep sponges
   had relatively higher cyanobacterial abundance, chlorophyll
   concentrations and symbiont photosynthetic efficiency than non-seep
   sponges, and a three-fold higher sponge abundance at the seep site.
   However, while gross oxygen production was the same for seep and
   non-seep sponges, seep sponge dark respiration rates were higher and
   instantaneous photosynthesis: respiration (P:R) ratios were lower. We
   show that while photosymbiont containing sponges may not have increased
   productivity under OA, they are able to show flexibility in their
   relationships with microbes and offset increased metabolic costs
   associated with climate change associated stress.},

Abstract = {Environmental change, including global warming and chemical pollution,
   can compromise cnidarian-(e.g., coral-) dinoflagellate symbioses and
   cause coral bleaching. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate these
   symbioses will inform strategies for sustaining healthy coral-reef
   communities. A model system for corals is the symbiosis between the sea
   anemone Exaiptasia pallida (common name Aiptasia) and its dinoflagellate
   partners (family Symbiodiniaceae). To complement existing studies of the
   interactions between these organisms, we examined the impact of menthol,
   a reagent often used to render cnidarians aposymbiotic, on the
   dinoflagellate Breviolum minutum, both in culture and in hospite. In
   both environments, the growth and photosynthesis of this alga were
   compromised at either 100 or 300 mu M menthol. We observed reduction in
   PSII and PSI functions, the abundances of reaction-center proteins, and,
   at 300 mu M menthol, of total cellular proteins. Interestingly, for
   free-living algae exposed to 100 mu M menthol, an initial decline in
   growth, photosynthetic activities, pigmentation, and protein abundances
   reversed after 5-15 d, eventually approaching control levels. This
   behavior was observed in cells maintained in continuous light, but not
   in cells experiencing a light-dark regimen, suggesting that B. minutum
   can detoxify menthol or acclimate and repair damaged photosynthetic
   complexes in a light- and/or energy-dependent manner. Extended exposures
   of cultured algae to 300 mu M menthol ultimately resulted in algal
   death. Most symbiotic anemones were also unable to survive this menthol
   concentration for 30 d. Additionally, cells impaired for photosynthesis
   by pre-treatment with 300 mu M menthol exhibited reduced efficiency in
   re-populating the anemone host.},

Title = {Intermittent shading can moderate coral bleaching on shallow reefs},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {The health of coral reefs is declining from the effects of human
   activity and climate change. Mass coral bleaching is often triggered by
   elevated water temperature and excessive solar irradiance. Shading can
   reduce coral bleaching risk. Shading-based management interventions,
   such as whole-of-reef marine fogging, have been proposed as a
   conservation tool for periods when coral undergoes excessive thermal
   stress. This study examined the effect of intermittent shade (30\% for
   0, 4, or 24 h) on two coral species, Duncanopsammia axifuga and
   Turbinaria reniformis, held at either 26.4 \& DEG;C or 32.4 \& DEG;C for
   18 days. Coral fragments were assessed for bleaching (relative mean
   intensity of grey, chlorophyll a, and symbiont density), photochemistry
   (PAM fluorometry), and antioxidant biomarkers (SOD and CAT). Shading
   responses were species-specific, with T. reniformis more responsive to
   shading than D. axifuga. Thirty per cent shading delayed bleaching up to
   three-degree heat weeks (DHW), and 24 h shade was more protective than 4
   h shade. Shading suppressed catalase activity in T. reniformis. Overall,
   our results suggest that intermittently shading corals for 4 h can
   moderate light stress and slow bleaching in some corals and could
   improve the efficiency of active solar radiation management in marine
   ecosystems.},

Title = {Zooxanthellae expelled from bleached corals at 33°C are
   photosynthetically competent},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {220},
Pages = {163-168},
Abstract = {While a number of factors have been linked to coral bleaching, such as
   high light, high temperature, low salinity, and UV exposure, the best
   explanation for recent coral bleaching events are small temperature
   excursions of 1 to 2 degreesC above summer sea-surface temperatures in
   the tropics which induce the dinoflagellate. symbionts (zooxanthellae)
   to be expelled from the host. The mechanism that triggers this expulsion
   of the algal symbionts is not resolved, but has been attributed to
   damage to the photosynthetic mechanism of the zooxanthellae. In the
   present investigation we addressed the question of whether such expelled
   zooxanthellae are indeed impaired irreversibly in their photosynthesis.
   We employed a Microscopy Pulse Amplitude-Modulated (PAM) fluorometer, by
   which individual zooxanthellae can be examined to study photosynthesis
   in zooxanthellae expelled when corals are subjected to a temperature of
   33 degreesC. We show that the expelled zooxanthellae from Cyphastrea
   serailia were largely unaffected in their photosynthesis and could be
   heated to 37 degreesC before showing temperature-induced photosynthetic
   impairment. These results suggest strongly that the early events that
   trigger temperature-induced expulsion of zooxanthellae involve a
   dysfunction in the interaction of the zooxanthellae and the coral host
   tissue, and not a dysfunction in the zooxanthellae per se.},

Abstract = {With coral reefs declining globally, resilience of these ecosystems
   hinges on successful coral recruitment. However, knowledge of the

   challenges such as ocean acidification (OA) in earliest life stages is
   limited. Our combination of physiological measurements, microscopy,
   computed tomography techniques and gene expression analysis allowed us
   to thoroughly elucidate the mechanisms underlying the response of
   early-life stages of corals, together with their algal partners, to the
   projected decline in oceanic pH. We observed extensive physiological,
   morphological and transcriptional changes in surviving recruits, and the
   transition to a less-skeleton/more-tissue phenotype. We found that
   decreased pH conditions stimulate photosynthesis and endosymbiont
   growth, and gene expression potentially linked to photosynthates
   translocation. Our unique holistic study discloses the previously unseen
   intricate net of interacting mechanisms that regulate the performance of
   these organisms in response to OA.},

Title = {Effects of thermal stress and nitrate enrichment on the larval

Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {173-182},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The effects of multiple stressors on the early life stages of
   reef-building corals are poorly understood. Elevated temperature is the
   main physiological driver of mass coral bleaching events, but increasing
   evidence suggests that other stressors, including elevated dissolved
   inorganic nitrogen (DIN), may exacerbate the negative effects of thermal
   stress. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the performance of
   larvae of Orbicella faveolata and Porites astreoides, two important
   Caribbean reef coral species with contrasting reproductive and algal
   transmission modes, under increased temperature and/or elevated DIN. We
   used a fluorescence-based microplate respirometer to measure the oxygen
   consumption of coral larvae from both species, and also assessed the
   effects of these stressors on P. astreoides larval settlement and
   mortality. Overall, we found that (1) larvae increased their respiration
   in response to different factors (O. faveolata in response to elevated
   temperature and P. astreoides in response to elevated nitrate) and (2)
   P. astreoides larvae showed a significant increase in settlement as a
   result of elevated nitrate, but higher mortality under elevated
   temperature. This study shows how microplate respirometry can be
   successfully used to assess changes in respiration of coral larvae, and
   our findings suggest that the effects of thermal stress and nitrate
   enrichment in coral larvae may be species specific and are neither
   additive nor synergistic for O. faveolata or P. astreoides. These
   findings may have important consequences for the recruitment and
   community reassembly of corals to nutrient-polluted reefs that have been
   impacted by climate change.},

Title = {Diazotroph-Derived Nitrogen Assimilation Strategies Differ by
   Scleractinian Coral Species},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUL 28},
Abstract = {Reef-building corals generally thrive in nutrient-poor tropical waters,
   where among other elements, nitrogen (N) availability often limits
   primary productivity. In addition to their close association with
   endosymbiotic dinoflagellates of the family Symbiodiniaceae, enabling an
   effective use and retention of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN),
   scleractinian corals have developed strategies to acquire new N: (1)
   They can ingest N-rich sediment particles and preys (from picoplankton
   to macro-zooplankton) via heterotrophy, including diazotrophs
   {[}plankton fixing dinitrogen (N2) and releasing part of this
   nitrogen-Diazotroph-Derived N (DDN)-in seawater], a pathway called
   ``heterotrophic nutrition on diazotrophs{''}; (2) Symbiotic diazotrophs
   located in the coral holobiont have the molecular machinery to fix N2, a
   pathway called ``symbiotic N2 fixation{''}. Here we used the 15N2
   isotopic labeling in a series of incubations to investigate the relative
   contribution of each of these DDN transfer pathways in three worldwide
   distributed coral species: Acropora muricata, Galaxea fascicularis, and
   Pocillopora damicornis. We show that N provision via ``symbiotic N2
   fixation{''} is negligible compared to that obtained via ``heterotrophic
   nutrition on diazotrophs,{''} with DDN assimilation rates about a
   thousand times lower for P. damicornis and G. fascicularis, or
   assimilation rates via ``symbiotic N2 fixation{''} almost nil for A.
   muricata. Through heterotrophic feeding on planktonic diazotrophs, only
   G. fascicularis and P. damicornis can successfully obtain N and fulfill
   a large part of their N requirements (DDN asimilation rates: 0.111 +/-
   0.056 and 0.517 +/- 0.070 mu g N cm-2 h-1 in their Symbiodiniaceae,
   respectively). Whereas this contribution is again negligible for A.
   muricata. They also largely consume the picoplankton that likely benefit
   from this DDN (Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus cells; respectively,
   2.56 +/- 1.57 104 and 2.70 +/- 1.66 104 cell h-1 cm-2 for G.
   fascicularis; 3.02 +/- 0.19 105 and 1.14 +/- 0.79 104 cell h-1 cm-2 for
   P. damicornis). The present study confirms the different dependencies of
   the three tested species regarding heterotrophy, with P. damicornis and
   G. fascicularis appearing highly efficient at capturing plankton, while
   A. muricata, considered as mainly autotroph, does not rely on these food
   resources to meet its N and energy needs.

Title = {The coral <i>Platygyra verweyi</i> exhibits local adaptation to
   long-term thermal stress through host-specific physiological and
   enzymatic response},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Climate change threatens coral survival by causing coral bleaching,
   which occurs when the coral's symbiotic relationship with algal
   symbionts (Symbiodiniaceae) breaks down. Studies on thermal adaptation
   focus on symbionts because they are accessible both in vitro and in
   hospite. However, there is little known about the physiological and
   biochemical response of adult corals (without Symbiodiniaceae) to
   thermal stress. Here we show acclimatization and/or adaptation potential
   of menthol-bleached aposymbiotic coral Platygyra verweyi in terms of
   respiration breakdown temperature (RBT) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH)
   enzyme activity in samples collected from two reef sites with
   contrasting temperature regimes: a site near a nuclear power plant
   outlet (NPP-OL, with long-term temperature perturbation) and Wanlitong
   (WLT) in southern Taiwan. Aposymbiotic P. verweyi from the NPP-OL site
   had a 3.1 degrees C higher threshold RBT than those from WLT. In
   addition, MDH activity in P. verweyi from NPP-OL showed higher thermal
   resistance than those from WLT by higher optimum temperatures and the
   activation energy required for inactivating the enzyme by heat. The MDH
   from NPP-OL also had two times higher residual activity than that from
   WLT after incubation at 50 degrees C for 1 h. The results of RBT and
   thermal properties of MDH in P. verweyi demonstrate potential
   physiological and enzymatic response to a long-term and regular thermal
   stress, independent of their Symbiodiniaceae partner.},

Abstract = {Stable carbon and oxygen isotope measurements of biogenic carbonate
   provide information for reconstructing past oceanic environments. In
   particular, O-18/O-16 ratios correlate with the temperature and salinity
   of seawater and C-13/C-12 is a proxy for dissolved inorganic carbon in
   seawater and symbiont photosynthesis. Here, we report C-13/C-12 and
   O-18/O-16 values for skeletons of corals (genus Porites) with various
   growth rates. In faster-growing coral S, C-13/C-12 and O-18/O-16 showed
   out-of-phase annual fluctuations. In slower-growing corals, the isotopes
   fluctuated in phase. We developed a simple vector notation to show two
   patterns of C-13/C-12 annual fluctuation, each with a different offset
   in relation to O-18/O-16 annual fluctuation. The phase offset between
   C-13/C-12 and O-18/O-16 annual fluctuations depends on the relative
   intensities of kinetic isotope effects on calcification and metabolic
   isotope effects such as photosynthesis. This model might improve our
   ability to infer past climate and oceanographic conditions from coral
   skeletons. Copyright (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Coral reef ecosystems have great economic, social, and ecological value.
   The ecological success of coral reef ecosystems critically depends on
   coral-algal symbiosis and coral-prokaryotic partnership. However,
   seasonal changes underlying these relationships in subtropical hard
   corals of Hong Kong are poorly studied. Here, we compared the community
   changes of algal symbionts and prokaryotic partners in Platygyra carnosa
   and Galaxea fascicularis from Hong Kong collected at two seasonal time
   points of winter and summer via massively parallel sequencing of genetic
   markers and multivariate analysis. The results indicated that algal
   symbionts showed no significant changes between the two seasonal time
   points but prokaryotic partners changed substantially. Prokaryotic
   partners putatively involved in photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, and
   sulfur oxidation increased significantly from winter to summer, while
   prokaryotic partners potentially associated with chemosynthesis, ammonia
   oxidation, and nitrite oxidation decreased significantly from winter to
   summer. Dissolved oxygen and pH served as the main contributors
   influencing prokaryotic partners in winter, while temperature,
   turbidity, and salinity played a dominant role in shaping prokaryotic
   partners in summer. The findings of the present study suggest that
   season structures prokaryotic partners but not algal symbionts in
   subtropical hard corals.},

Abstract = {To examine the response to exposure to a thermal gradient in coral, we
   assessed the effect of a gradual 10 degrees C temperature increase (22
   to 32 degrees C over 10 h) on normal (N), partially bleached (P) and
   control (C) samples collected from different branches of the same coral
   (Pocillopora capitata). We examined markers of oxidative stress,
   including lipid peroxidation (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)
   activity, indicators of bleaching, including chlorophyll a (Chl a) and
   carotenoid pigment (PC) levels, as well as zooxanthellae density. Our
   results revealed that N, P and C coral samples all contained higher
   levels of PC versus Chl a. The levels of both pigments increased as the
   temperature increased from 22 to 28 degrees C only in N and C samples,
   whereas P samples showed less cellular damage than N and C samples at
   temperatures between 26 and 28 degrees C, and had greater antioxidant
   activities at temperatures between 26 and 30 degrees C. The rate of
   zooxanthellar expulsion consistently increased with temperature in all
   three coral types across the entire temperature range. Collectively,
   these results indicate that temperature has a direct effect on the
   antagonistic relationship between temperature-induced damage and
   protective antioxidant mechanisms in this type of coral. (c) 2006

Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},

Abstract = {Coral reefs occupy only similar to 0.1 percent of the ocean's habitat,
   but are the most biologically diverse marine ecosystem. In recent
   decades, coral reefs have experienced a significant global decline due
   to a variety of causes, one of the major causes being widespread coral
   bleaching events. During bleaching, the coral expels its symbiotic
   algae, thereby losing its main source of nutrition generally obtained
   through photosynthesis. While recent coral bleaching events have been
   extensively investigated, there is no scientific data on historical
   coral bleaching prior to 1979. In this study, we employ high-resolution
   femtosecond Laser Ablation Multiple Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma
   Mass Spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS) to demonstrate a distinct biologically
   induced decline of boron (B) isotopic composition (delta B-11) as a
   result of coral bleaching. These findings and methodology offer a new
   use for a previously developed isotopic proxy to reconstruct paleo-coral
   bleaching events. Based on a literature review of published delta B-11
   data and our recorded vital effect of coral bleaching on the delta B-11
   signal, we also describe at least two possible coral bleaching events
   since the Last Glacial Maximum. The implementation of this bleaching
   proxy holds the potential of identifying occurrences of coral bleaching
   throughout the geological record. A deeper temporal view of coral
   bleaching will enable scientists to determine if it occurred in the past
   during times of environmental change and what outcome it may have had on
   coral population structure. Understanding the frequency of bleaching
   events is also critical for determining the relationship between natural
   and anthropogenic causes of these events.},

Abstract = {The Ligurian Sea ( NW Mediterranean) experienced warm summers in 1998,
   1999 and from 2003 to 2005. The temperature was 1-3 degrees C higher
   than the mean summer value (24 degrees C) and remained high over a long
   period. During these summers, mass-mortality events, affecting several
   sessile benthic species, were reported. In the present study, we tested
   the long-term (3-7 weeks) effect of different temperatures (20 degrees C
   measured in spring and autumn, 24 degrees C observed in summer, and 26
   degrees C and 28 degrees C abnormal summer values) on two Mediterranean
   corals, Cladocora caespitosa and Oculina patagonica. Growth rate,
   photosynthetic efficiency (F-v/F-m), relative electron transport rate
   (ETR), zooxanthellae and chlorophyll (chl) contents were measured during
   48 days incubation. At 20 degrees C, all parameters remained constant
   during the whole experiment for both species. At higher temperatures,
   most physiological parameters were affected by only 2-5 weeks at 24
   degrees C, and were severely depressed at higher temperatures. Small
   replicate samples (nubbins) of O. patagonica significantly decreased
   their zooxanthellae and chl concentrations at all temperatures, after 2
   weeks of incubation. Their F-v/F-m values, as well as their growth
   rates, were also gradually reduced during the incubation at all
   temperatures. However, only a few nubbins maintained at 28 degrees C
   showed signs of tissue necrosis after 34 days, and these gradually
   recovered tissue when temperature was returned to normal. In nubbins of
   C. caespitosa, chl and zooxanthellae concentrations decreased only after
   34 days of incubation at 26 degrees C and 28 degrees C. At the same
   time, tissue necrosis was observed, explaining the loss of the
   symbionts. F-v/F-m was reduced only after 34 days of incubation at the
   different temperatures, and growth rate was first enhanced, before
   collapsing by 30\% at 24 degrees C and by 90-100\% at 26 degrees C and
   28 degrees C. All samples maintained at 26 degrees C and 28 degrees C
   had died, due to tissue necrosis, by the end of the experiment. Results
   obtained suggest that O. patagonica is more able than C. caespitosa to
   resist high temperature conditions because of its rapid bleaching
   capacity. In contrast, it seems that C. caespitosa is living close to
   its thermal limit during the summer period; therefore, a long-term
   increase at 24 degrees C or above could be lethal for this coral, just
   as was observed in situ during the recent warm summers.},

Abstract = {Exposure to elevated temperature is known to cause photosynthetic
   inhibition in the coral symbiont Symbiodinium sp. Through the use of the
   artificial electron acceptor, methyl viologen, this study identified how
   reduced photosynthetic capacity occurs as a result of inhibition up-
   and/or downstream of ferredoxin in Symbiodinium sp. in hospite and in
   culture. Heterogeneity between coral species and symbiont clades was
   identified in the thermal sensitivity of photosynthesis in the symbionts
   of the scleractinian corals Stylophora pistillata and Pocillopora
   damicornis, as well as among Symbiodinium cultures of clades A, B, and
   C. The in hospite symbionts of S. pistillata and the cultured clade C
   Symbiodinium both exhibited similar patterns in that their primary site
   of thermal inhibition occurred downstream of ferredoxin at 32 degrees C.
   In contrast, the primary site of thermal inhibition occurred upstream of
   ferredoxin in clades A and B at 32 degrees C, while at 34 degrees C, all
   samples showed combined up- and downstream inhibition. Although clade C
   is common to both P. damicornis and S. pistillata, the manner of thermal
   inhibition was not consistent when observed in hospite. Results showed
   that there is heterogeneity in the primal site of thermal damage in
   Symbiodinium among coral species and symbiont clades.},

Title = {Ocean Acidification and Warming Lead to Increased Growth and Altered

   hainanensis</i>},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Ocean acidification and warming affect the growth and predominance of
   algae. However, the effects of ocean acidification and warming on the
   growth and gene transcription of thermo-tolerant algae are poorly
   understood. Here we determined the effects of elevated temperature (H)
   and acidification (A) on a recently discovered coral-associated
   thermo-tolerant alga Symbiochlorum hainanensis by culturing it under two
   temperature settings (26.0 and 32.0 degrees C) crossed with two pH
   levels (8.16 and 7.81). The results showed that the growth of S.
   hainanensis was positively affected by H, A, and the combined treatment
   (AH). However, no superimposition effect of H and A on the growth of S.
   hainanensis was observed under AH. The analysis of chlorophyll
   fluorescence, pigment content, and subcellular morphology indicated that
   the chloroplast morphogenesis (enlargement) along with the increase of
   chlorophyll fluorescence and pigment content of S. hainanensis might be
   a universal mechanism for promoting the growth of S. hainanensis.
   Transcriptomic profiles revealed the effect of elevated temperature on
   the response of S. hainanensis to acidification involved in the
   down-regulation of photosynthesis- and carbohydrate metabolism-related
   genes but not the up-regulation of genes related to antioxidant and
   ubiquitination processes. Overall, this study firstly reports the
   growth, morphology, and molecular response of the thermo-tolerant alga
   S. hainanensis to future climate changes, suggesting the predominance of
   S. hainanensis in its associated corals and/or coral reefs in the
   future.},

Abstract = {Modeling of past climates is critically dependent on estimates of past
   sea surface temperatures (SSTs), for which one of the principal
   techniques used is the measurement of Sr/Ca ratios in corals
   {[}Guilderson er al., 1994; McCulloch et al., 1999; Hughen er al.,
   1999]. The link between coral Sr/Ca and SST is not well-understood and
   there have been a number of discrepant observations {[}de Villiers et
   al., 1995; Alibert, 1998]. Corals with symbiotic zooxanthellae are known
   to show large diurnal fluctuations in calcification rate associated with
   the photosynthetic activity of their symbionts. Using detailed
   measurements with the ion microprobe, we compared the Sr/Ca content of
   discrete daytime and nighttime skeletal structures in the massive
   hermatypic coral Porites lutea over the course of 1 year and a seasonal
   temperature range of 4 degreesC. The Sr/Ca content of daytime skeleton
   is always lower than that of adjacent nighttime skeleton. While the
   slope of the nighttime Sr/Ca-SST correlation is close to that seen in
   inorganic aragonite precipitates, that of the daytime correlation is >4
   times as steep. We attribute these differences to the role of
   photosynthesis in calcification and conclude that bulk Sr/Ca is related
   principally to daytime calcification rate rather than directly to SST.
   More reliable estimates of past SST may be arrived at through selective
   analysis of nighttime skeleton.},

Abstract = {Adaptation, acclimatization and symbiont diversity are known to regulate
   thermal tolerance in corals, but the role of these mechanisms remains
   poorly constrained in other photosymbioses, such as large benthic
   foraminifera (LBFs), which are known to bleach at temperatures that are
   likely to be exceeded in the near future. LBFs inhabit a broad range of
   shallow-water settings. Within species, differences in thermal tolerance
   have been found among populations from different habitats, but it is not
   clear whether such differences occur among LBFs inhabiting similar
   habitats, but differing in other aspects, such as symbiont type. To this
   end, we compared responses to thermal stress in specimens from a
   population of Amphistegina lessonii, an abundant Indo-Pacific species,
   to specimens of Amphistegina gibbosa, its Atlantic counter-part, from a
   similar environment but two different water depths (5 and 18 m). Test
   groups of each species were exposed in a common experiment to three
   thermal stress scenarios over a four-week period. Growth, respiration,
   mortality and motility were measured to characterize the holobiont
   response. Coloration, photosynthesis and chlorophyll a content were
   measured to determine the response of the endosymbiotic diatoms. The
   photosymbionts were characterized by genetic fingerprinting. Our results
   show that, although groups of A. gibbosa were collected from different
   habitats, their responses were similar, indicating only marginally
   higher tolerance to thermal peaks in specimens from the shallower site.
   In contrast, species-specific differences were stronger, with A.
   lessonii showing higher tolerance to episodic stress and less pronounced
   impacts of chronic stress on motility, growth and photosymbiont
   performance. These interspecies variations are consistent with the
   presence of different and more diverse symbiont assemblages in A.
   lessonii compared with A. gibbosa. This study demonstrates the
   importance of considering symbiont diversity in the assessment of infra-
   and interspecific variations in stress responses in LBFs.},

Abstract = {The thermal microenvironment of corals and the thermal effects of
   changing flow and radiation are critical to understanding heat-induced
   coral bleaching, a stress response resulting from the destruction of the
   symbiosis between corals and their photosynthetic microalgae.
   Temperature microsensor measurements at the surface of illuminated stony
   corals with uneven surface topography (Leptastrea purpurea and Platygyra
   sinensis) revealed millimetre-scale variations in surface temperature
   and thermal boundary layer (TBL) that may help understand the patchy
   nature of coral bleaching within single colonies. The effect of water
   flow on the thermal microenvironment was investigated in hemispherical
   and branching corals (Porites lobata and Stylophora pistillata,
   respectively) in a flow chamber experiment. For both coral types, the
   thickness of the TBL decreased exponentially from 2.5 mm at
   quasi-stagnant flow (0.3 cm s(-1)), to 1 mm at 5 cm s(-1), with an
   exponent approximately 0.5 consistent with predictions from the heat
   transfer theory for simple geometrical objects and typical of laminar
   boundary layer processes. Measurements of mass transfer across the
   diffusive boundary layer using O-2 microelectrodes revealed a greater
   exponent for mass transfer when compared with heat transfer, indicating
   that heat and mass transfer at the surface of corals are not exactly
   analogous processes.},

Title = {Ocean warming and acidification synergistically increase coral mortality},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JAN 19},
Abstract = {Organisms that accumulate calcium carbonate structures are particularly
   vulnerable to ocean warming (OW) and ocean acidification (OA),
   potentially reducing the socioeconomic benefits of ecosystems reliant on
   these taxa. Since rising atmospheric CO2 is responsible for global
   warming and increasing ocean acidity, to correctly predict how OW and OA
   will affect marine organisms, their possible interactive effects must be
   assessed. Here we investigate, in the field, the combined temperature
   (range: 16-26 degrees C) and acidification (range: pHTS 8.1-7.4) effects
   on mortality and growth of Mediterranean coral species transplanted, in
   different seasonal periods, along a natural pH gradient generated by a
   CO2 vent. We show a synergistic adverse effect on mortality rates (up to
   60\%), for solitary and colonial, symbiotic and asymbiotic corals,
   suggesting that high seawater temperatures may have increased their
   metabolic rates which, in conjunction with decreasing pH, could have led
   to rapid deterioration of cellular processes and performance. The net
   calcification rate of the symbiotic species was not affected by
   decreasing pH, regardless of temperature, while in the two asymbiotic
   species it was negatively affected by increasing acidification and
   temperature, suggesting that symbiotic corals may be more tolerant to
   increasing warming and acidifying conditions compared to asymbiotic
   ones.},

Title = {Impact of bleaching conditions on the components of non-photochemical
   quenching in the zooxanthellae of a coral},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {322},
Number = {1},

Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {Mass coral bleaching events are a worldwide phenomenon, which generally
   occur during periods of elevated sea surface temperature and intense
   sunlight. These conditions result in a decline in photochemical
   efficiency of symbiotic microalgae (zooxanthellae) which ultimately
   leads to the expulsion of these symbionts. The physiological mechanism
   which triggers the release of the zooxanthellae has yet to be adequately
   determined. Under bleaching conditions, non-photochemical quenching
   (NPQ) is used to dissipate excess energy from photosystem II (PSII). NPQ
   was partitioned into three components, (energy dependent quenching
   {[}qE], state transition quenching {[}qT] and photoinhibitory quenching
   {[}qI]), based on relaxation kinetics upon addition of
   3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) and darkening. This
   investigation revealed that for corals not exposed to bleaching stress,
   qE was the principle means of energy dissipation (similar to 60\% of the
   total NPQ). In corals exposed to either high-light (475 mu mol photons
   m(-2) s(-1) and 25 degrees C) or elevated temperature (225 mu mol
   photons m(-2) s(-1) and 32 degrees C) treatments, the dominant component
   of NPQ was qE and the relative proportions did not change during the
   exposure period (1-8 h). When exposed to bleaching conditions (475 mu
   mol photons m(-2) s(-1) and 32 degrees C) the contribution of the
   different components changed after 4 h and the total NPQ increased. At
   this time, the contribution of qT to the total NPQ significantly
   increased to equal that of qE (40\%), suggesting state transitions
   become more important under such conditions. Throughout the exposure
   period in all treatments, no change in the proportion of qI was
   observed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   bleaching recovery},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 22},
Abstract = {In this study, we explore how the Caribbean coral Orbicella faveolata
   recovers after bleaching, using fragments from 13 coral colonies exposed
   to heat stress (32 degrees C) for ten days. Biological parameters and
   coral optical properties were monitored during and after the stress.
   Increases in both, the excitation pressure over photosystem II (Qm) and
   pigment specific absorption (a{*}(Chla)) were observed in the stressed
   corals, associated with reductions in light absorption at the
   chlorophyll a red peak (D-e675) and symbiont population density. All
   coral fragments exposed to heat stress bleached but a fraction of the
   stressed corals recovered after removing the stress, as indicated by the
   reductions in Q(m) and increases in D-e675 and the symbiont population
   observed. This subsample of the experimentally bleached corals also
   showed blooms of the endolithic algae Ostreobium spp. underneath the
   tissue. Using a numerical model, we quantified the amount of incident
   light reflected by the coral, and absorbed by the different pigmented
   components: symbionts, host-tissue and Ostreobium spp. Our study
   supports the key contribution of Ostreobium spp. blooms near the
   skeletal surface, to coral recovery after bleaching by reducing skeleton
   reflectance. Endolithic blooms can thus significantly alleviate the high
   light stress that affects the remaining symbionts during the stress or
   when the coral has achieved the bleached phenotype.},

Abstract = {Evaluating the response of organisms to stress assumes that functional
   benchmarks are available against which the response can be gauged, but
   this expectation remains unfulfilled for many taxa. As a result,
   attempts to describe the organismic effects of environmental degradation
   and physiological stress can prove misleading. Functional benchmarks and
   the effects of stress are particularly germane to coral reefs that
   globally are exposed to significant environmental challenges, and in
   this study, we compiled data on scleractinian corals to describe a
   reference against which stress responses can be gauged. Based on this
   construct, we tested the veracity of well-established
   contrasts-involving differences in physiological function among depths
   and families-to evaluate the capacity of available data to support
   synthetic analyses. Our analysis used 126 papers describing 37 genera,
   and at least 73 species, and described 13 traits, first independent of
   depth, and second, by depth. Data appropriate for these analyses were so
   sparse that depth-and family-level effects were inconspicuous, although
   the depth contrast revealed a decline in dark respiration and an
   increase in calcification (both normalized to area) in deeper water. Our
   analyses of scleractinian literature revealed limitations of the data
   available for synthetic analyses, as well for describing functional
   benchmarks within this taxon. We attribute some of these effects to
   differences in the physical environment under which measurements were
   made, and suspect that such problems are commonplace for other taxa.
   Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) models provide one means to overcome some of
   these problems, and they can be used for any taxon to quantitatively
   summarize data for comparative analyses of stressor responses. The
   suitability of these models is illustrated for scleractinian corals by
   predicting from first principles the ratio of Symbiodinium to holobiont
   carbon and the respiration.},

Title = {Warming resistant corals from the Gulf of Aqaba live close to their
   cold-water bleaching threshold},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAR 25},
Abstract = {Global climate change is causing increasing variability and extremes in
   weather worldwide, a trend set to continue. In recent decades both
   anomalously warm and cold seawater temperatures have resulted in mass
   coral bleaching events. Whilst corals' response to elevated temperature
   has justifiably attracted substantial research interest, coral
   physiology under cold water stress is relatively unfamiliar. The
   response to below typical winter water temperature was tested for two
   common reef building species from the Gulf of Aqaba in an ex situ
   experiment. Stylophora pistillata and Acropora eurystoma were exposed to
   1 or 3 degrees C below average winter temperature and a suite of
   physiological parameters were assessed. At 3 degrees C below winter
   minima (ca. 18.6 degrees C), both species had significant declines in
   photosynthetic indices (maximum quantum yield, electron transport rate,
   saturation irradiance, and photochemical efficiency) and chlorophyll
   concentration compared to corals at ambient winter temperatures. It was
   previously unknown that corals at this site live close to their
   cold-water bleaching threshold and may be vulnerable as climate
   variability increases in magnitude. In order to determine if a cold
   winter reduces the known heat resistance of this population, the corals
   were subsequently exposed to an acute warm period at 30 degrees C the
   following summer. Exposed to above typical summer temperatures, both
   species showed fewer physiological deviations compared to the cold-water
   stress. Therefore, the cold winter experience did not increase corals'
   susceptibility to above ambient summer temperatures. This study provides
   further support for the selection of heat tolerant genotypes colonising
   the Red Sea basin and thereby support the mechanism behind the Reef
   Refuge Hypothesis.},

Title = {What is the role of zooxanthellae during coral bleaching? Review of
   zooxanthellae and their response to environmental stress},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are diverse and productive but sensitive ecosystems. Due to
   the impact of climate change, these organisms are in danger of dying
   out, mainly through the process of coral bleaching, which is the process
   by which zooxanthellae (algal endosymbionts) are expelled from their
   respective coral hosts, causing the coral to lose colour and become
   white. Coral bleaching has been linked to increases in sea surface
   temperatures as well as an increase in light intensity. We reviewed the
   different zooxanthellae taxa and their ecological traits, as well as the
   information available on the protective mechanisms present in
   zooxanthellae cells when they experience environmental stress
   conditions, such as temperature fluctuations, specifically concentrating
   on heat shock proteins and their response to antioxidant stress. The
   eight clades (A-H) previously recognised were reorganised into seven
   existing genera. Different zooxanthellae taxa exhibit different
   ecological traits such as their photosynthetic stress responses to light
   and temperature. Zooxanthellae have the ability to regulate the number
   and type of heat shock proteins (Hsps) they produce during a heat
   response. They can also regulate the host's respective Hsps. Antioxidant
   responses that can prevent coral hosts from expelling the zooxanthellae,
   can be found both within exposed coral tissue and the zooxanthellae
   cells. Despite the lower likelihood of bleaching in South African coral
   reefs, genetic engineering presents a useful tool to understand and
   adapt traits within zooxanthellae genotypes to help mitigate coral
   bleaching in the future.
   Significance:
   Coral bleaching is the expulsion of zooxanthellae (algal symbionts) from
   the respective coral host, mainly due to elevated sea surface
   temperatures and light intensities, but numerous other factors, such as
   changes concerning salinity (ocean acidification), may also cause coral
   bleaching, although to a much lesser extent.
   A specific clade of zooxanthellae can be linked to their coral host's
   susceptibility to variation in oceanic temperatures, most probably by
   regulating both the host's respective heat shock proteins as well as
   their own.
   South African reefs have not experienced coral bleaching to the same
   degree as elsewhere in the world, mainly due to their unique reef
   topography and oceanic currents.
   Genetic bioengineering of zooxanthellae cells provides a plausible
   solution to save southern African coral reefs before it is too late.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUL 19},
Abstract = {Although coral reef ecosystems across the globe are in decline due to
   climate change and other anthropogenic stressors, certain inshore reefs
   of the Upper Florida Keys reef tract have persisted, with some even
   thriving, under marginalized conditions. To better understand the
   molecular basis of the thermotolerance displayed by these corals, a
   laboratory-based temperature challenge experiment that also featured
   conspecifics from a more stress-susceptible offshore reef was conducted
   with the common Caribbean reef-builder Orbicela faveolata, and the
   proteomes of both the coral hosts and their endosymbiotic dinoflagellate
   communities were profiled in (1) controls, (2) corals that succumbed to
   high-temperature stress and bleached, and (3) those that instead
   acclimated to high temperatures ex situ. Proteomic signatures varied
   most significantly across temperatures, host genotypes, and
   Symbiodiniaceae assemblages, and the two eukaryotic compartments of this
   mutualism exhibited distinct proteomic responses to high temperatures.
   Both partners maintained high levels of molecular chaperones and other
   canonical (eukaryotic) stress response (CSR) proteins in all treatments
   (including controls). Instead, proteins involved in lipid trafficking,
   metabolism, and photosynthesis played greater roles in the holobionts'
   high-temperature responses, and these energy mobilization processes may
   have sustained the elevated protein turnover rates associated with the
   constitutively active CSR.},

Abstract = {Corals at the world's southernmost coral reef of Lord Howe Island (LHI)
   experience large temperature and light fluctuations and need to deal
   with periods of cold temperature (< 18 degrees C), but few studies have
   investigated how corals are able to cope with these conditions. Our
   study characterized the response of key photophysiological parameters,
   as well as photoacclimatory and photoprotective pigments (chlorophylls,
   xanthophylls, and beta-carotene), to short-term (5-d) cold stress
   (similar to 15 degrees C; 7 degrees C below control) in three LHI coral
   species hosting distinct Symbiodinium ITS2 types, and compared the
   coral-symbiont response to that under elevated temperature (similar to
   29 degrees C; 7 degrees C above control). Under cold stress, Stylophora
   sp. hosting Symbiodinium C118 showed the strongest effects with regard
   to losses of photochemical performance and symbionts. Pocillopora
   damicornis hosting Symbiodinium C100/C118 showed less severe bleaching
   responses to reduced temperature than to elevated temperature, while
   Porites heronensis hosting Symbiodinium C111{*} withstood both reduced
   and elevated temperature. Under cold stress, photoprotection in the form
   of xanthophyll deepoxidation increased in unbleached P. heronensis (by
   178\%) and bleached Stylophora sp. (by 225\%), while under heat stress
   this parameter increased in unbleached P. heronensis (by 182\%) and in
   bleached P. damicornis (by 286\%). The xanthophyll pool size was stable
   in all species at all temperatures. Our comparative study demonstrates
   high variability in the bleaching vulnerability of these coral species
   to low and high thermal extremes and shows that this variability is not
   solely determined by the ability to activate xanthophyll de-epoxidation.},

Abstract = {Aims Fourteen percent of all living coral, equivalent to more than all
   the coral on the Great Barrier Reef, has died in the past decade as a
   result of climate change-driven bleaching. Inspired by the `oxidative
   stress theory of coral bleaching', we investigated whether a bacterial
   consortium designed to scavenge free radicals could integrate into the
   host microbiome and improve thermal tolerance of the coral model,
   Exaiptasia diaphana. Methods and Results E. diaphana anemones were
   inoculated with a consortium of high free radical scavenging (FRS)
   bacteria, a consortium of congeneric low FRS bacteria, or sterile
   seawater as a control, then exposed to elevated temperature. Increases
   in the relative abundance of Labrenzia during the first 2 weeks
   following the last inoculation provided evidence for temporary inoculum
   integration into the E. diaphana microbiome. Initial uptake of other
   consortium members was inconsistent, and these bacteria did not persist
   either in E. diaphana's microbiome over time. Given their
   non-integration into the host microbiome, the ability of the FRS
   consortium to mitigate thermal stress could not be assessed.
   Importantly, there were no physiological impacts (negative or positive)
   of the bacterial inoculations on the holobiont. Conclusions The
   introduced bacteria were not maintained in the anemone microbiome over
   time, thus, their protective effect is unknown. Achieving long-term
   integration of bacteria into cnidarian microbiomes remains a research
   priority. Significance and Impact of the Study Microbiome engineering
   strategies to mitigate coral bleaching may assist coral reefs in their
   persistence until climate change has been curbed. This study provides
   insights that will inform microbiome manipulation approaches in coral
   bleaching mitigation research.},

Abstract = {Occurrences whereby cnidaria lose their symbiotic dinoflagellate
   microalgae (Symbiodinium spp.) are increasing in frequency and
   intensity. These so-called bleaching events are most often related to an
   increase in water temperature, which is thought to limit certain
   Symbiodinium phylotypes from effectively dissipating absorbed excitation
   energy that is otherwise used for photochemistry. Here, we examined
   photosynthetic characteristics and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production,
   a possible signal involved in bleaching, from two Symbiodinium types (a
   thermally ``tolerant{''} A1 and ``sensitive{''} B1) representative of
   cnidaria-Symbiodinium symbioses of reef-building Caribbean corals. Under
   steady-state growth at 26 degrees C, a higher efficiency of PSII
   photochemistry, rate of electron turnover, and rate of O-2 production
   were observed for type A1 than for B1. The two types responded very
   differently to a period of elevated temperature (32 degrees C): type A1
   increased light-driven O-2 consumption but not the amount of H2O2
   produced; in contrast, type B1 increased the amount of H2O2 produced
   without an increase in light-driven O-2 consumption. Therefore, our
   results are consistent with previous suggestions that the thermal
   tolerance of Symbiodinium is related to adaptive constraints associated
   with photosynthesis and that sensitive phylotypes are more prone to H2O2
   production. Understanding these adaptive differences in the genus
   Symbiodinium will be crucial if we are to interpret the response of
   symbiotic associations, including reef-building corals, to environmental
   change.},

Abstract = {Increase in seawater temperature is one of the major effects of global
   climate change that affects marine organisms, including Cnidaria. Among
   them, gorgonians from the NW Mediterranean Sea, such as the species
   Eunicella singularis, have suffered spectacular and extensive damage. We
   thus investigated in a controlled laboratory experiment the response of
   E. singularis to a long-term increase in temperature and we took a
   special interest in its photosynthetic and calcification response to the
   stress. Two populations collected at 15 and 35 m depths were studied in
   order to determine whether there was a difference in sensitivity to
   thermal stress between living depths. Our results show: (a) that
   calcification and photosynthesis were impacted only when gorgonians were
   maintained for more than two weeks at 26 degrees C, and (b) that
   colonies of E. singularis living in shallow waters were less tolerant
   than those living in deep waters. Because E. singularis is a symbiotic
   species, we have also discussed the potential role of symbiosis in the
   thermotolerance response.},

Title = {The influence of irradiance on tolerance to high and low temperature

Abstract = {The coral Pocillopora damicornis hosts genetically distinct and novel
   types of dinoflagellate symbionts at the high-latitude site of Lord Howe
   Island (LHI), yet why these novel types exist at this marginal site is
   unknown. In this study, it was determined whether one of the novel
   Symbiodinium types at LHI is physiologically adapted for this
   high-latitude site, where water temperatures annually range from 18
   degrees C to 26 degrees C. Low and high short-term thermal bleaching
   thresholds of the coral-symbiont partnership were measured as 14 degrees
   C and 30 degrees C. Photochemical sensitivity to temperature (15 degrees
   C and 29 degrees C) and light treatments (100\% and 40\% of sunlight),
   measured as effective quantum yield and fast induction curves, were
   determined over a 72-h period. A greater effect on the photochemical
   reactions of LHI P. damicornis symbionts was recorded in response to a 3
   degrees C temperature increase from annual maxima than a 3 degrees C
   temperature decrease from annual minima. Corals did not bleach when
   temperature was reduced to 15 degrees C for 72 h; in contrast, a 92\%
   decline in photochemical efficiency was recorded in the 29 degrees C
   treatment (Delta F: F-m' < 0.05), compared to 35\% loss in the control
   (20 degrees C). For the first time, a Pulse Efficiency Analyser
   fluorometer was used to assess the effect of reduced temperature on
   symbionts, showing a reduced rate of Q(A) reduction, further enhanced by
   high light levels. This type of Symbiodinium at LHI may be specialized
   for cooler and more variable temperatures, so contributing to the
   success of corals at this marginal location.},

Abstract = {Skeletal delta(13)C levels in symbiotic reef corals are believed to be
   predominantly influenced by metabolic fractionation. Therefore,
   environmental variables influencing coral metabolism should also affect
   skeletal delta(13)C levels. To test this hypothesis, we measured the
   effects of light (which drives photosynthesis) and relative zooplankton
   levels (heterotrophy) on skeletal delta(13)C values in the corals Pavona
   clavus and P. gigantea at two depths (1 m and 7 m). For both species,
   decreases in light or increases in zooplankton resulted in significant
   decreases in skeletal delta(13)C levels. A significant decrease in
   delta(13)C values with depth was observed in Pavona gigantea only. Thus,
   light and zooplankton directly affect coral skeletal delta(13)C values,
   supporting the hypothesis that metabolic fractionation significantly
   contributes to skeletal delta(13)C levels. Simultaneous decreases in
   both light and zooplankton resulted in decreases in skeletal delta(13)C
   values, reflecting decreases in light. In Pavona clavus, intra-annual
   variation in skeletal delta(13)C values over one year correlated with
   seasonal changes in irradiance. Further study is needed to resolve how
   skeletal delta(13)C values vary at intermediate levels of irradiance and
   zooplankton, and in other coral species.},

Title = {Intracellular pH and its response to CO<sub>2</sub>-driven seawater

Abstract = {Regulating intracellular pH (pH(i)) is critical for optimising the
   metabolic activity of corals, yet the mechanisms involved in pH
   regulation and the buffering capacity within coral cells are not well
   understood. Our study investigated how the presence of symbiotic
   dinoflagellates affects the response of pH(i) to P-CO2-driven seawater
   acidification in cells isolated from Pocillopora damicornis. Using the
   fluorescent dye BCECF-AM, in conjunction with confocal microscopy, we
   simultaneously characterised the pH(i) response in host coral cells and
   their dinoflagellate symbionts, in symbiotic and non-symbiotic states
   under saturating light, with and without the photosynthetic inhibitor
   DCMU. Each treatment was run under control (pH 7.8) and CO2-acidified
   seawater conditions (decreasing pH from 7.8 to 6.8). After 105 min of
   CO2 addition, by which time the external pH (pH(e)) had declined to 6.8,
   the dinoflagellate symbionts had increased their pH(i) by 0.5 pH units
   above control levels when in the absence of DCMU. In contrast, in both
   symbiotic and non-symbiotic host coral cells, 15 min of CO2 addition
   (0.2 pH unit drop in pH(e)) led to cytoplasmic acidosis equivalent to
   0.3-0.4 pH units irrespective of whether DCMU was present. Despite
   further seawater acidification over the duration of the experiment, the
   pH(i) of non-symbiotic coral cells did not change, though in host cells
   containing a symbiont cell the pH(i) recovered to control levels when
   photsynthesis was not inhibited. This recovery was negated when cells
   were incubated with DCMU. Our results reveal that photosynthetic
   activity of the endosymbiont is tightly coupled with the ability of the
   host cell to recover from cellular acidosis after exposure to high
   CO2/low pH.},

Abstract = {The demographic characteristics of the solitary zooxanthellate
   scleractinian Balanophyllia europaea, endemic to the Mediterranean, were
   determined in six populations, on a latitudinal gradient along the
   Italian coast, and compared with the mean annual sea surface temperature
   (SST). Growth rate correlated negatively, and asymptotic length of the
   individuals positively with SST. With increasing SST, the distributions
   of age frequencies moved away from a typical steady state structure
   (i.e., exponential decrease in the frequency of individuals with age),
   indicating less stable populations and showed a deficiency of
   individuals in the younger-age classes. These observations suggest that
   high temperatures are an adverse factor to the B. europaea symbiosis.
   Using projected increases in seawater temperature, most of the B.
   europaea populations in the Mediterranean are expected to be close to
   their thermal limits by 2100 and the populations at that time may
   support few young individuals.},

Abstract = {Corals live in symbiosis with algal dino-flagellates, which can achieve
   outstanding photosynthetic energy efficiencies in hospite approaching
   theoretical limits. However, how such photosynthetic efficiency varies
   with environmental stress remains poorly known. Using fiber-optic and
   electrochemical microsensors in combination with variable chlorophyll
   fluorescence imaging, we investigated the combined effects of thermal
   stress and active feeding on the radiative energy budget and
   photosynthetic efficiency of the symbiotic coral Pocillopora sp. At
   ambient temperature (25 degrees C), the percentage of absorbed light
   energy used for photosynthesis under low irradiance was higher for fed
   (similar to 5-6\%) compared to unfed corals (4\%). Corals from both
   feeding treatments responded equally to stress from high light exposure
   (2400 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)), exhibiting a decrease in
   photosynthetic efficiency, down to 0.5-0.6\%. Fed corals showed
   increased resilience to thermal-induced bleaching (loss of symbionts)
   compared to unfed corals. In addition, while unfed corals decreased
   their photosynthetic efficiency almost immediately when exposed to
   thermal stress, fed corals maintained a constant and high photosynthetic
   efficiency for 5 more days after onset of thermal stress. We conclude
   that active feeding is beneficial to corals by prolonging coral health
   and resilience during thermal stress as a result of an overall healthier
   symbiont population.},

Title = {Breakdown of the coral-algae symbiosis: towards formalising a linkage
   between warm-water bleaching thresholds and the growth rate of the
   intracellular zooxanthellae},
Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Impairment of the photosynthetic machinery of the algal endosymbiont
   ({''}zooxanthellae{''}) is the proximal driver of the thermal breakdown
   of the coral-algae symbiosis ({''}coral bleaching{''}). Yet, the initial
   site of damage, and early dynamics of the impairment are still not well
   resolved. In this perspective essay, I consider further a recent
   hypothesis which proposes an energetic disruption to the
   carbon-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) of the coral host, and the
   resultant onset of CO2-limitation within the photosynthetic ``dark
   reactions{''} as a unifying cellular mechanism. The hypothesis
   identifies the enhanced retention of photosynthetic carbon for
   zooxanthellae (re) growth following an initial irradiance-driven
   expulsion event as a strong contributing cause of the energetic
   disruption. If true, then it implies that the onset of the bleaching
   syndrome and setting of upper thermal bleaching limits are emergent
   attributes of the coral symbiosis that are ultimately underpinned by the
   characteristic growth profile of the intracellular zooxanthellae; which
   is known to depend not just on temperature, but also external (seawater)
   nutrient availability and zooxanthellae genotype. Here, I review this
   proposed bleaching linkage at a variety of observational scales, and
   find it to be parsimonious with the available evidence. Future
   experiments are suggested that can more formally test the linkage. If
   correct, the new cellular model delivers a valuable new perspective to
   consider the future prospects of the coral symbiosis in an era of rapid
   environmental change, including: (i) the underpinning mechanics (and
   biological significance) of observed changes in resident zooxanthellae
   genotypes, and (ii) the now crucial importance of reef water quality in
   co-determining thermal bleaching resistance.},

Abstract = {The effects of elevated CO2 and temperature on photosynthesis and
   calcification in the calcifying algae Halimeda macroloba and Halimeda
   cylindracea and the symbiont-bearing benthic foraminifera Marginopora
   vertebralis were investigated through exposure to a combination of four
   temperatures (28 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 32 degrees C, and 34 degrees
   C) and four CO2 levels (39, 61, 101, and 203 Pa; pH 8.1, 7.9, 7.7, and
   7.4, respectively). Elevated CO2 caused a profound decline in
   photosynthetic efficiency (F-V : F-M), calcification, and growth in all
   species. After five weeks at 34 degrees C under all CO2 levels, all
   species died. Chlorophyll (Chl) a and b concentration in Halimeda spp.
   significantly decreased in 203 Pa, 32 degrees C and 34 degrees C
   treatments, but Chl a and Chl c(2) concentration in M. vertebralis was
   not affected by temperature alone, with significant declines in the 61,
   101, and 203 Pa treatments at 28 degrees C. Significant decreases in F-V
   : F-M in all species were found after 5 weeks of exposure to elevated
   CO2 (203 Pa in all temperature treatments) and temperature (32 degrees C
   and 34 degrees C in all pH treatments). The rate of oxygen production
   declined at 61, 101, and 203 Pa in all temperature treatments for all
   species. The elevated CO2 and temperature treatments greatly reduced
   calcification (growth and crystal size) in M. vertebralis and, to a
   lesser extent, in Halimeda spp. These findings indicate that 32 degrees
   C and 101 Pa CO2, are the upper limits for survival of these species on
   Heron Island reef, and we conclude that these species will be highly
   vulnerable to the predicted future climate change scenarios of elevated
   temperature and ocean acidification.},

Abstract = {Thermal stress affects organism performance differently depending on the
   ambient temperature to which they are acclimatized, which varies along
   latitudinal gradients. This study investigated whether differences in
   physiological responses to temperature are consistent with regional
   differences in temperature regimes for the stony coral Oculina
   patagonica. To resolve this question, we experimentally assessed how
   colonies originating from four different locations characterized by >3
   degrees C variation in mean maximum annual temperature responded to
   warming from 20 to 32 degrees C. We assessed plasticity in symbiont
   identity, density, and photosynthetic properties, together with changes
   in host tissue biomass. Results show that, without changes in the type
   of symbiont hosted by coral colonies, O. patagonica has limited capacity
   to acclimatize to future warming. We found little evidence of variation
   in overall thermal tolerance, or in thermal optima, in response to
   spatial variation in ambient temperature. Given that the invader O.
   patagonica is a relatively new member of the Mediterranean coral fauna,
   our results also suggest that coral populations may need to remain
   isolated for a long period of time for thermal adaptation to potentially
   take place. Our study indicates that for O. patagonica, mortality
   associated with thermal stress manifests primarily through tissue
   breakdown under moderate but prolonged warming (which does not impair
   symbiont photosynthesis and, therefore, does not lead to bleaching).
   Consequently, projected global warming is likely to cause repeat
   incidents of partial and whole colony mortality and might drive a
   gradual range contraction of Mediterranean corals.},

Abstract = {Warmer than average summer sea surface temperature is one of the main
   drivers for coraltemperature is one of the main drivers for coral
   bleaching, which describes the loss of endosymbiotic dinoflagellates
   (genus: Symbiodinium) in reef-building corals. Past research has
   established that oxidative stress in the symbiont plays an important
   part in the bleaching cascade. Corals hosting different genotypes of
   Symbiodinium may have varying thermal bleaching thresholds, but changes
   in the symbiont's antioxidant system that may accompany these
   differences have received less attention. This study shows that
   constitutive activity and up-regulation of different parts of the
   antioxidant network under thermal stress differs between four
   Symbiodinium types in culture and that thermal susceptibility can be
   linked to glutathione redox homeostasis. In Symbiodinium B1, C1 and E,
   declining maximum quantum yield of PSII (F-v/F-m) and death at 33
   degrees C were generally associated with elevated superoxide dismutase
   (SOD) activity and a more oxidized glutathione pool. Symbiodinium F1
   exhibited no decline in F-v/F-m or growth, but showed proportionally
   larger increases in ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity and glutathione
   content (GSx), while maintaining GSx in a reduced state. Depressed
   growth in Symbiodinium B1 at a sublethal temperature of 29 degrees C was
   associated with transiently increased APX activity and glutathione pool
   size, and an overall increase in glutathione reductase (GR) activity.
   The collapse of GR activity at 33 degrees C, together with increased
   SOD, APX and glutathione S-transferase activity, contributed to a strong
   oxidation of the glutathione pool with subsequent death. Integrating
   responses of multiple components of the antioxidant network highlights
   the importance of antioxidant plasticity in explaining type-specific
   temperature responses in Symbiodinium.},

Abstract = {The symbiosis between corals and dinoflagellates in the family
   Symbiodiniaceae is threatened by warming trends that induce coral
   bleaching, or symbiosis breakdown. Current models of symbiosis breakdown
   involve an immune response to an elevation in reactive oxygen species
   that ultimately results in the loss of the symbiont. However, the
   intimate nature of the symbiosis implies an important role for the
   symbiont surface as a point of interaction between partners. The
   response of symbiont cell surface proteins to experimental temperature
   stress was, therefore, investigated using a cell surface biotin probe.
   Cell-surface protein composition was found to be dynamically regulated
   in response to heat stress, particularly after 24 h of exposure to heat
   treatment. This pattern was primarily driven by an increased abundance
   in heat shock proteins, demonstrating that stress experienced by the
   symbiont can manifest at the cell surface. Elements known to activate
   host immunity were also increased in response to temperature stress,
   further demonstrating an avenue by which the symbiont can elicit a host
   immune response independent of reactive oxygen species. This work
   documents the cell surface protein composition of a Symbiodiniaceae
   species for the first time and highlights host-symbiont interaction
   mechanisms that may be important during symbiosis breakdown.},

Title = {Skeletal light-scattering accelerates bleaching response in
   reef-building corals},
Journal = {BMC ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Month = {MAR 21},
Abstract = {Background: At the forefront of ecosystems adversely affected by climate
   change, coral reefs are sensitive to anomalously high temperatures which
   disassociate (bleaching) photosynthetic symbionts (Symbiodinium) from
   coral hosts and cause increasingly frequent and severe mass mortality
   events. Susceptibility to bleaching and mortality is variable among
   corals, and is determined by unknown proportions of environmental
   history and the synergy of Symbiodinium- and coral-specific properties.
   Symbiodinium live within host tissues overlaying the coral skeleton,
   which increases light availability through multiple light-scattering,
   forming one of the most efficient biological collectors of solar
   radiation. Light-transport in the upper similar to 200 mu m layer of
   corals skeletons (measured as `microscopic' reduced-scattering
   coefficient, mu'(S,m)), has been identified as a determinant of excess
   light increase during bleaching and is therefore a potential determinant
   of the differential rate and severity of bleaching response among coral
   species.
   Results: Here we experimentally demonstrate (in ten coral species) that,
   under thermal stress alone or combined thermal and light stress,
   low-mu'(S,m) corals bleach at higher rate and severity than
   high-mu'(S,m) corals and the Symbiodinium associated with low-mu'(S,m)
   corals experience twice the decrease in photochemical efficiency. We
   further modelled the light absorbed by Symbiodinium due to
   skeletal-scattering and show that the estimated skeleton-dependent light
   absorbed by Symbiodinium (per unit of photosynthetic pigment) and the
   temporal rate of increase in absorbed light during bleaching are several
   fold higher in low-mu'(S,m) corals.
   Conclusions: While symbionts associated with low-mu'(S,m) corals receive
   less total light from the skeleton, they experience a higher rate of
   light increase once bleaching is initiated and absorbing bodies are
   lost; further precipitating the bleaching response. Because microscopic
   skeletal light-scattering is a robust predictor of light-dependent
   bleaching among the corals assessed here, this work establishes mu'(S,m)
   as one of the key determinants of differential bleaching response.},

Abstract = {Algal symbiont-bearing benthic foraminifera are producers of both
   organic and inorganic carbon in coral-reef ecosystems. However, their
   contribution to the total budget of reef carbon production has not been
   adequately quantified. We used O-2-respirometry and alkalinity-anomaly
   techniques to estimate the organic and inorganic carbon production rates
   of three species of symbiont-bearing large foraminifera common to coral
   reef flats in the northwest Pacific Ocean. The species studied were
   Baculogypsina sphaerulata and Calearina gaudichaudii, which both harbor
   diatom endosymbionts, and Marginopora kudakajimensis, which harbors
   dinoflagellate endosymbionts. Live mature individuals were placed onto
   mesh in clear airtight containers filled with filtered seawater. The
   containers were incubated for several hours at a constant temperature
   and subjected to different levels of light intensity. Seawater was
   continuously mixed throughout the experiment. Dissolved oxygen, pH and
   total alkalinity were measured before and after incubation. Three
   species of larger benthic foraminifera were net organic and inorganic
   carbon producers. The P/R ratio exceeded 1 for all species. No
   photoinhibition was observed up to 1500 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), and
   calcification was enhanced by light. These findings suggest that the
   three species are net carbon producers adapted to high-light, reef-flat
   environments. In addition, we calculated that Baculogypsina sphaerulata
   and C. gaudichaudii together accounted for 2-7.5\% of the gross primary
   production of a reef-crest community, whereas M. kudakajimensis supplied
   1-11\% of the gross primary production of a backreef community. The two
   calcarinids and M. kudakajimensis contributed similar to 1 and 10\% of
   the inorganic carbon production of seaward reef flat and protected
   lagoon communities, respectively. Together with previous reports, these
   estimates suggest that algal symbiont-bearing foraminifera play a minor
   but essential role in the organic and inorganic carbon production of
   coral-reef ecosystems.},

Abstract = {1. Global warming permits range expansions of tropical marine species
   into mid-latitude habitats, where they are, however, faced with cold
   winter temperatures. Therefore, tolerance to cold temperatures may be
   the key adaptation controlling zonal range expansion in tropical marine
   species.
   2. Here we investigated the molecular and physiological response to cold
   and heat stress in a tropical symbiont-bearing foraminifera that has
   successfully invaded the Eastern Mediterranean.
   3. Our physiological measurements indicate thermal tolerance of the
   diatom symbionts but a decrease in growth for the foraminifera host
   under both cold and warm stress.
   4. The combined ('holobiont') transcriptome revealed an asymmetric
   response in short-term gene expression under cold versus warm stress.
   Cold stress induced major reorganization of metabolic processes,
   including regulation of genes involved in photosynthesis. Analyses
   limited to genes that are inferred to belong to the symbionts confirm
   that the observed pattern is due to changes in the regulation of
   photosynthesis-related genes and not due to changes in the abundance of
   the symbionts.
   5. In contrast to cold stress, far fewer genes change expression under
   heat stress and those that do are primarily related to movement and
   cytoskeleton. This implies that under cold stress, cellular resources
   are allocated to the maintenance of photosynthesis, and the key to zonal
   range shifts of tropical species could be the cold tolerance of the
   symbiosis.},

   Adult <i>Favites colemani</i>},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Tropical coral reefs are threatened by local-scale stressors that are
   exacerbated by global ocean warming and acidification from the
   post-industrial increase of atmospheric CO2 levels. Despite their
   observed decline in the past four decades, little is known on how
   Philippine coral reefs will respond to ocean warming and acidification.
   This study explored individual and synergistic effects of present-day
   (pH 8.0, 28 degrees C) and near-future (pH 7.7, 32 degrees C) scenarios
   of ocean temperature and pH on the adult Favites colemani, a common
   massive reef-building coral in Bolinao-Anda, Philippines. Changes in
   seawater temperature drive the physiological responses of F. colemani,
   whereas changes in pH create an additive effect on survival, growth, and
   photosynthetic efficiency. Under near-future scenarios, F. colemani
   showed sustained photosynthetic competency despite the decline in growth
   rate and zooxanthellae density. F. colemani exhibited specificity with
   the Cladocopium clade C3u. This coral experienced lower growth rates but
   survived projected near-future ocean warming and acidification
   scenarios. Its pH-thermal stress threshold is possibly a consequence of
   acclimation and adaptation to local environmental conditions and past
   bleaching events. This research highlights the importance of examining
   the susceptibility and resilience of Philippine corals to climate-driven
   stressors for future conservation and restoration efforts in the
   changing ocean.},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {71},

Abstract = {Effects of elevated seawater temperature show high spatial heterogeneity
   and variation within and among coral species. The objective of this
   study was to investigate how two coral species, Porites lutea and
   Galaxea fascicularis, from two high latitude reefs differently exposed
   to chronic disturbance, respond to elevated seawater temperatures.
   Corals were collected from reefs nearshore (i.e. subjected to high
   sediment load, higher chlorophyll a concentrations, turbidity etc.) and
   offshore (i.e. less exposed). The corals were exposed in the lab to
   gradually increasing temperatures (25.5-33.5 degrees C) for 72 h after
   which they were allowed to recover to ambient temperature (25.5 degrees
   C) for 24 h. Production and respiration were measured after 24, 48, 72
   and 96 h. The results show that P. lutea from nearshore reefs suffered
   an initial decrease in gross primary production/respiration (GP/R) ratio
   after 24 h, after only a moderate temperature increase (+2 degrees C,
   from 25.5 to 27.5 degrees C), while there was no difference in GP/R
   ratio between heat-exposed and controls the other days, indicating that
   the chronic disturbance in the nearshore reef had no effect on their
   thermotolerance. Furthermore, P. lutea from the offshore reef showed a
   decrease in GP/R ratio both after 24 h and 72 h (33.5 degrees C) of
   exposure.
   In comparison, G. fascicularis showed a decrease in GP/R ratio after 48
   h, 72 h and 96 h of exposure for the nearshore corals. Also, after 72 h
   these corals had withdrawn their polyps. There were no differences
   between heat-treated and controls for the offshore G. fascicularis. This
   implies that the chronically disturbed G. fascicularis had lower
   thermotolerance when exposed to a temperature increase.
   This study, hence, shows that the response of corals to elevated
   seawater temperature varies with species and environmental background
   history. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The resistance of hard corals to warming can be negatively affected by
   nitrate eutrophication, but related knowledge for soft corals is scarce.
   We thus investigated the ecophysiological response of the pulsating soft
   coral Xenia umbellata to different levels of nitrate eutrophication
   (control = 0.6, medium = 6, high = 37 mu M nitrate) in a laboratory
   experiment, with additional warming (27.7 to 32.8 degrees C) from days
   17 to 37. High nitrate eutrophication enhanced cellular chlorophyll a
   content of Symbiodiniaceae by 168\%, while it reduced gross
   photosynthesis by 56\%. After additional warming, polyp pulsation rate
   was reduced by 100\% in both nitrate eutrophication treatments, and
   additional polyp loss of 7\% d(-1) and total fragment mortality of 26\%
   was observed in the high nitrate eutrophication treatment. Warming alone
   did not affect any of the investigated response parameters. These
   results suggest that X. umbellata exhibits resistance to warming, which
   may facilitate ecological dominance over some hard corals as ocean
   temperatures warm, though a clear negative physiological response occurs
   when combined with nitrate eutrophication. This study thus confirms the
   importance of investigating combinations of global and local factors to
   understand and manage changing coral reefs.},

Abstract = {The correlation between two environmental factors (solar radiation and

   species, biometric parameters varied more with temperature than with
   solar radiation. In the zooxanthellate species, temperature explained a
   higher percentage of biometric parameter variance than in the
   azooxanthellate species. While environmental factors did not co-vary
   with demographic characteristics in L. pruvoti, temperature was
   negatively related to the population density of B. europaea. It is
   hypothesized that the negative effect of temperature on biometry and
   population density of B. europaea depends on photosynthesis inhibition
   of symbiotic zooxanthellae at high temperatures, which would lower the
   calcification rate and availability of energetic resources.},

Title = {The Symbiodinium Proteome Response to Thermal and Nutrient Stresses},
Journal = {PLANT AND CELL PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 24},
Abstract = {Coral bleaching is primarily caused by high sea surface temperatures,
   and nutrient enrichment of reefs is associated with lower resilience to
   thermal stress and ecological degradation. Excess inorganic nitrogen
   relative to phosphate has been proposed to sensitize corals to thermal
   bleaching. We assessed the physiological and proteomic responses of
   cultures of the dinoflagellate coral symbiont Symbiodinium
   microadriaticum to elevated temperature under low-nutrient,
   high-nutrient and phosphate-limited conditions. Elevated temperature
   induced reductions of many chloroplast proteins, particularly the
   light-harvesting complexes, and simultaneously increased the abundance
   of many chaperone proteins. Proteomes were similar when the N:P ratio
   was near the Redfield ratio, regardless of absolute N and P
   concentrations, but were strongly affected by phosphate limitation. Very
   high N:P inhibited Symbiodinium cell division while increasing the
   abundance of chloroplast proteins. The proteome response to phosphate
   limitation was greater than that to elevated temperature, as measured by
   the number of differentially abundant proteins. Increased physiological
   sensitivity to high temperatures under high nutrients or imbalanced N:P
   ratios was not apparent; however, oxidative stress response proteins
   were enriched among proteins responding to thermal stress under
   imbalanced N:P ratios. These data provide a detailed catalog of the
   effects of high temperatures and nutrients on a coral symbiont proteome.},

Title = {Transcriptomic Analysis of Thermally Stressed <i>Symbiodinium</i>
   Reveals Differential Expression of Stress and Metabolism Genes},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Endosymbioses between dinoflagellate algae (Symbiodinium sp.) and
   scleractinian coral species form the foundation of coral reef
   ecosystems. The coral symbiosis is highly susceptible to elevated
   temperatures, resulting in coral bleaching, where the algal symbiont is
   released from host cells. This experiment aimed to determine the
   transcriptional changes in cultured Symbiodinium, to better understand
   the response of cellular mechanisms under future temperature conditions.
   Cultures were exposed to elevated temperatures (average 31 degrees C) or
   control conditions (24.5 degrees C) for a period of 28 days. Whole
   transcriptome sequencing of Symbiodinium cells on days 4, 19, and 28
   were used to identify differentially expressed genes under thermal
   stress. A large number of genes representing 37.01\% of the
   transcriptome (similar to 23,654 unique genes, FDR < 0.05) with
   differential expression were detected at no less than one of the time
   points. Consistent with previous studies of Symbiodinium gene
   expression, fold changes across the transcriptome were low, with 92.49\%
   differentially expressed genes at <= 2-fold change. The transcriptional
   response included differential expression of genes encoding stress
   response components such as the antioxidant network and molecular
   chaperones, cellular components such as core photosynthesis machinery,
   integral light-harvesting protein complexes and enzymes such as fatty
   acid desaturases. Differential expression of genes encoding glyoxylate
   cycle enzymes were also found, representing the first report of this in
   Symbiodinium. As photosynthate transfer from Symbiodinium to coral hosts
   provides up to 90\% of a coral's daily energy requirements, the
   implications of altered metabolic processes from exposure to thermal
   stress found in this study on coral-Symbiodinium associations are
   unknown and should be considered when assessing the stability of the
   symbiotic relationship under future climate conditions.},

Volume = {6},

Abstract = {Environmental stress, such as an increase in the sea surface
   temperature, triggers coral bleaching, a profound dysfunction of the
   mutualist symbiosis between the host cnidarians and their photosynthetic
   dinoflagellates of the Family Symbiodiniaceae. Because of climate
   change, mass coral bleaching events will increase in frequency and
   severity in the future, threatening the persistence of this iconic
   marine ecosystem at global scale. Strategies adapted to coral reefs
   preservation and restoration may stem from the identification of the
   succession of events and of the different molecular and cellular
   contributors to the bleaching phenomenon. To date, studies aiming to
   decipher the cellular cascade leading to temperature-related bleaching,
   emphasized the involvement of reactive species originating from
   compromised bioenergetic pathways (e.g. cellular respiration and
   photosynthesis). These molecules are responsible for damage to various
   cellular components causing the dysregulation of cellular homeostasis
   and the breakdown of symbiosis. In this review, we synthesize the
   current knowledge available in the literature on the cellular mechanisms
   caused by thermal stress, which can initiate or participate in the cell
   cascade leading to the loss of symbionts, with a particular emphasis on
   the role of each partner in the initiating processes.},

   the reef-building coral <i>Acropora yongei</i>},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {2},
Month = {FEB 2},
Abstract = {Climate change driven increases in intensity and frequency of both hot
   and cold extreme events contribute to coral reef decline by causing
   widespread coral bleaching and mortality. Here, we show that hot and
   cold temperature changes cause distinct physiological responses on
   different time scales in reef-building corals. We exposed the branching
   coral Acropora yongei in individual aquaria to a +/- 5 degrees C
   temperature change. Compared to heat-treated corals, cold-treated corals
   initially show greater declines in growth and increases in
   photosynthetic pressure. However, after 2-3 weeks, cold-treated corals
   acclimate and show improvements in physiological state. In contrast,
   heat did not initially harm photochemical efficiency, but after a delay,
   photosynthetic pressure increased rapidly and corals experienced severe
   bleaching and cessation of growth. These results suggest that short-term
   cold temperature is more damaging for branching corals than short-term
   warm temperature, whereas long-term elevated temperature is more harmful
   than long-term depressed temperature.},

Title = {Environmental gradients drive physiological variation in Hawaiian corals},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1505-1523},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {To evaluate potential coral adaptive mechanisms, we investigated
   physiological traits (biomass, lipid, protein, chlorophyll, and isotopic
   proxies for trophic strategy) in eight Hawaiian corals species along an
   environmental gradient of significant wave height, sea surface
   temperature, and seawater chlorophyll a concentration around the island
   of O'ahu, Hawai'i. We used the amount of physiological variation
   expressed in corals, and the proportion of this variation that could be
   explained by environmental variables, to construct hypotheses about the
   relative capacity for each species to adapt or acclimatize to differing
   conditions. Genus-level analyses indicated that Montipora and
   Pocillopora phenotypes are influenced more strongly by the environment
   than Porites corals. Species-level analyses revealed that Montipora
   capitata and Pocillopora acuta have the widest physiological niche
   boundaries, whereas Porites evermanni and Pocillopora meandrina are more
   physiologically restricted. Correlations between individual traits and
   the environmental gradient provided insight into potential adaptive
   mechanisms employed by each species that allow them to persist in reefs
   such as those within Kane'ohe Bay, where water flow is lowest, and
   temperature, acidity, and nutrient concentrations are highest relative
   to other reefs around O'ahu. Potential adaptive mechanisms included (a)
   increased surface-area-to-volume ratios to facilitate higher material
   flux across the diffusive boundary layer and/or to maximize light
   harvesting (M. capitata and P. acuta), (b) strategic investment of
   metabolic energy toward energy reserves (Montipora and Pocillopora), (c)
   changes in protein management likely via differential expression and
   function (Porites), and d) increased chlorophyll concentration per
   Symbiodiniaceae cell to maximize photosynthesis (Porites compressa).
   Comparison of our results with established patterns in the relative
   abundance of these species around O'ahu suggests that species with wide
   physiological niche boundaries like M. capitata and M. flabellata might
   be expected to do better under predicted future ocean conditions and
   outcompete species such as P. evermanni and P. meandrina, making them
   potential candidates for coral conservation efforts.},

Volume = {39},

Abstract = {High sea surface temperature accompanied by high levels of solar
   irradiance is responsible for the disruption of the symbiosis between
   cnidarians and their symbiotic dinoflagellates from the genus
   Symbiodinium. This phenomenon, known as coral bleaching, is one of the
   major threats affecting coral reefs around the world. Because an
   important molecular trigger to bleaching appears related to the
   production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), it is critical to
   understand the function of the antioxidant network of Symbiodinium
   species. In this study we investigated the response of two Symbiodinium
   species, from contrasting environments, to a chemically induced
   oxidative stress. ROS produced during this oxidative burst reduced
   photosynthesis by 30 to 50\% and significantly decreased the activity of
   superoxide dismutase. Lipid peroxidation levels and carotenoid
   concentrations, especially diatoxanthin, confirm that these molecules
   act as antioxidants and contribute to the stabilization of membrane
   lipids. The comparative analysis between the two Symbiodinium species
   allowed us to highlight that Symbiodinium sp. clade A temperate was more
   tolerant to oxidative stress than the tropical S. kawagutii clade F.
   These differences are very likely a consequence of adaptation to their
   natural environment, with the temperate species experiencing conditions
   of temperature and irradiance much more variable and extreme.},

Title = {Evidence for the Thermal Bleaching of <i>Porites</i> Corals From 4.0ka
   BP in the Northern South China Sea},

Abstract = {Coral bleaching is becoming a serious issue for coral reefs under the
   stress of global warming. However, whether it has occurred in the past
   in times of thermal stress remains unclear. Moreover, an understanding
   of historic coral bleaching events would greatly improve our insight
   into the adaptive capabilities of corals under such stresses. It is
   known that Porites corals, a massive coral, have relatively high levels
   of symbiotic zooxanthellae and a strong thermal tolerance when compared
   with most other corals (and particularly branched corals). Thus, growth
   hiatuses and/or mortality surfaces of fossil Porites may be used to
   indicate past ecological or environmental stress events, such as severe
   bleaching. In this study, monthly geochemical and isotopic environmental
   proxies of four fossil Porites corals with well-preserved growth
   hiatuses and mortality surfaces (aged 3,800-4,200years before 2013A.D.),
   collected from Wenchang fringing reef, Hainan Island, Northern South
   China Sea were analyzed. Specifically, the Sr/Ca, O-18, and C-13 were
   measured with a monthly resolution for each sample. These environmental
   proxies were used to reconstruct the sea surface temperature (SST), sea
   surface salinity (SSS), and physiological activity of the coral at the
   time when the growth hiatuses and/or mortality surfaces occurred. These
   data were subsequently used to determine the causes of coral mortality
   and growth discontinuity in each case. The results show that growth
   hiatuses and mortalities mainly occurred in summer, with high SST (31-34
   degrees C) and SSS (32.8-38.4). In addition, abrupt negative shifts of
   2-3 in C-13 were observed in almost all of the surfaces of growth hiatus
   and mortality, indicating a dramatically reduced level of photosynthetic
   activity in symbiotic zooxanthellae. Because of the above reasons, we
   conclude that the frequently observed mortality and growth discontinuity
   of Porites corals from the mid-Holocene is evidence for thermal
   bleaching events in the past. That is, coral bleaching has occurred
   3,800-4,200years ago and is not a new phenomenon.
   Plain Language Summary We carried out this pilot study to explore the
   possible response of coral to generally warm conditions in prehistoric
   periods. Four massive Porites coral fossils that died 3800-4200 years
   ago were collected from the Wenchang fringing reef, Hainan Island,
   Northern South China Sea. Our research shows that mortalities of Porites
   corals frequently occurred and they were caused by dramatically reduced
   photosynthesis activity of symbiotic zooxanthellae under the stresses of
   high thermal and saline conditions. The death of Porites corals means
   the occurrence of coral bleaching. The proof of thermal bleaching in the
   mid-Holocene indicates that coral bleaching events are not a new
   ecological phenomena and it may be a recurrent natural phenomenon.},

Abstract = {Ocean acidification represents a key threat to coral reefs by reducing
   the calcification rate of framework builders. In addition, acidification
   is likely to affect the relationship between corals and their symbiotic
   dinoflagellates and the productivity of this association. However,
   little is known about how acidification impacts on the physiology of
   reef builders and how acidification interacts with warming. Here, we
   report on an 8-week study that compared bleaching, productivity, and
   calcification responses of crustose coralline algae (CCA) and branching
   (Acropora) and massive (Porites) coral species in response to
   acidification and warming. Using a 30-tank experimental system, we
   manipulated CO2 levels to simulate doubling and three- to fourfold
   increases {[}intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projection
   categories IV and VI] relative to present-day levels under cool and warm
   scenarios. Results indicated that high CO2 is a bleaching agent for
   corals and CCA under high irradiance, acting synergistically with
   warming to lower thermal bleaching thresholds. We propose that CO2.
   induces bleaching via its impact on photoprotective mechanisms of the
   photosystems. Overall, acidification impacted more strongly on bleaching
   and productivity than on calcification. Interestingly, the intermediate,
   warm CO2 scenario led to a 30\% increase in productivity in Acropora,
   whereas high CO2 lead to zero productivity in both corals. CCA were most
   sensitive to acidification, with high CO2 leading to negative
   productivity and high rates of net dissolution. Our findings suggest
   that sensitive reef-building species such as CCA may be pushed beyond
   their thresholds for growth and survival within the next few decades
   whereas corals will show delayed and mixed responses.},

Title = {The skeleton of<i> Balanophyllia</i> coral species suggests adaptive
   traits linked to the onset of mixotrophy},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {795},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {The diversity in the skeletal features of coral species is an outcome of
   their evolution, distribution and habitat. Here, we explored, from
   macro-to nano-scale, the skeletal structural and compositional
   characteristics of three coral species belonging to the genus
   Balanophyllia having different trophic strategies. The goal is to
   address whether the onset of mixotrophy influenced the skeletal features
   of B. elegans, B. regia, and B. europaea. The macroscale data suggest
   that the presence of symbiotic algae in B. europaea can lead to a
   surplus of energy input that increases its growth rate and skeletal bulk
   density, leading to larger and denser corals compared to the
   azooxanthellate ones, B. regia and B. elegans. The symbiosis would also
   explain the higher intra-skeletal organic matrix (OM) content, which is
   constituted by macromolecules promoting the calcification, in B.
   europaea compared to the azooxanthellate species. The characterization
   of the soluble OM also revealed differences between B. europaea and the
   azooxanthellate species, which may be linked to diverse macromolecular
   machineries responsible for skeletal biosynthesis and final morphology.
   Differently, the crystallographic features were homogenous among
   species, suggesting that the basic building blocks of skeletons remained
   a conserved trait in these related species, regardless of the trophic
   strategy. These results show changes in skeletal phenotype that could be
   triggered by the onset of mixotrophy, as a consequence of the symbiotic
   association, displaying remarkable plasticity of coral skeletons which
   repeatedly allowed this coral group to adapt to a range of changing
   environments throughout its geological history. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Elevated <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> affects tissue biomass composition, but
   not calcification, in a reef coral under two light regimes},
Journal = {ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Ocean acidification (OA) is predicted to reduce reef coral calcification
   rates and threaten the long-term growth of coral reefs under climate
   change. Reduced coral growth at elevated pCO(2) may be buffered by
   sufficiently high irradiances; however, the interactive effects of OA
   and irradiance on other fundamental aspects of coral physiology, such as
   the composition and energetics of coral biomass, remain largely
   unexplored. This study tested the effects of two light treatments (7.5
   versus 15.7 mol photonsm(-2) d(-1)) at ambient or elevated pCO(2) (435
   versus 957 mu atm) on calcification, photopigment and symbiont
   densities, biomass reserves (lipids, carbohydrates, proteins), and
   biomass energy content (kJ) of the reef coral Pocillopora acuta from
   Kane `ohe Bay, Hawai'. While pCO(2) and light had no effect on either
   area-or biomass-normalized calcification, tissue lipids gdw(-1) and kJ
   gdw(-1) were reduced 15\% and 14\% at high pCO(2), and carbohydrate
   content increased 15\% under high light. The combination of high light
   and high pCO(2) reduced protein biomass (per unit area) by approximately
   20\%. Thus, under ecologically relevant irradiances, P. acuta in
   Kane'ohe Bay does not exhibit OA-driven reductions in calcification
   reported for other corals; however, reductions in tissue lipids, energy
   content and protein biomass suggest OA induced an energetic deficit and
   compensatory catabolism of tissue biomass. The null effects of OA on
   calcification at two irradiances support a growing body of work
   concluding some reef corals may be able to employ compensatory
   physiological mechanisms that maintain present-day levels of
   calcification under OA. However, negative effects of OA on P. acuta
   biomass composition and energy content may impact the long-term
   performance and scope for growth of this species in a high pCO(2) world.},

Abstract = {Corals are treatened by global warming. Bleaching is one immediate
   effect of global warming, resulting from the loss of photosynthetic
   endosymbiont dinoflagellates. Understanding host-symbiont associations
   are critical for assessing coral's habitat requirements and its response
   to environmental changes. Cladocopium (formerly family Symbiodiniaceae
   clade C) are dominant endosymbionts in the reef-building coral,
   Mussismilia braziliensis. This study aimed to investigate the effect of
   temperature on the biochemical and cellular features of Cladocopium.
   Heat stress increased oxygen (O-2) and decreased proteins, pigments
   (Chla + Chlc2), hexadecanoic acid- methyl ester, methyl stearate, and
   octadecenoic acid (Z)- methyl ester molecules. In addition, there was an
   increase in neutral lipids such as esterified cholesterol and a decrease
   in free fatty acids that may have been incorporated for the production
   of lipid droplets. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated
   that Cladocopium cells subjected to heat stress had thinner cell walls,
   deformation of chloroplasts, and increased lipid droplets after 3 days
   at 28 degrees C. These findings indicate that thermal stress negatively
   affects isolated Cladocopium spp. from Mussismilia host coral.},

Title = {Release of hydrogen peroxide and antioxidants by the coral <i>Stylophora

Abstract = {Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a common reactive oxygen species, plays
   multiple roles in coral health and disease. Elevated H2O2 production by
   the symbiotic algae during stress may result in symbiosis breakdown and
   bleaching of the coral. We have recently reported that various Red Sea
   corals release H2O2 and antioxidants to their external milieu, and can
   influence the H2O2 dynamics in the reef. Here, we present a laboratory
   characterization of H2O2 and antioxidant activity release kinetics by
   intact, non-stressed Stylophora pistillata. Experimenting with bleached
   and non-bleached corals and different stirring speeds, we explored the
   sources and modes of H2O2 and antioxidant release. Since H2O2 is
   produced and degraded simultaneously, we developed a methodology for
   resolving the actual H2O2 concentrations released by the corals.
   H2O2 and antioxidant activity steadily increased in the water
   surrounding the coral over short periods of 1-2 h. Over longer periods
   of 5-7 h, the antioxidant activity kept increasing with time, while H2O2
   concentrations were stabilized at similar to 1 mu M by 1-3 h, and then
   gradually declined. Solving for H2O2 release, corals were found to
   release H2O2 at increasing rates over 2-4 h, and then to slow down and
   stop by 5-7 h. Stirring was shown to induce the release of H2O2,
   possibly since the flow reduces the thickness of the diffusive boundary
   layer of the coral, and thus increases H2O2 mass flux. Antioxidant
   activity was released at similar rates by bleached and non-bleached
   corals, suggesting that the antioxidants did not originate from the
   symbiotic algae. H2O2, however, was not released from bleached corals,
   implying that the symbiotic algae are the source of the released H2O2.
   The observed flow-induced H2O2 release may aid corals in removing some
   of the internal H2O2 produced by their symbiotic algae, and may possibly
   assist in preventing coral bleaching under conditions of elevated
   temperature and irradiance.},

Abstract = {Reef-building corals experience high daily variation in their
   environment, food availability, and physiological activities such as
   calcification and photosynthesis by endosymbionts. On Ofu Island,
   American Samoa, we investigated day-night differences in gene expression
   under field conditions of changing pH, temperature, light, and oxygen.
   Using RNASeq techniques, we compared two replicate transcriptomes from a
   single coral colony of Acropora hyacinthus over six noons and five
   midnights. We identified 344 contigs with significant expression
   differences across 16,800 contigs in the transcriptome, most with small
   fold-changes. However, there were 21 contigs with fold-changes ranging
   from 10 to 141. The largest changes were in a set of transcription
   factors strongly associated with day-night gene regulation in other
   animals, including cryptochromes, thyrotroph embryonic factor, and D
   site-binding protein. We also found large daytime increases in a set of
   genes involved in glucose transport and glycogen storage. We found small
   expression differences in genes associated with aerobic ATP production
   and hypoxia response, along with slightly higher expression of most
   calcification genes at noon. Although similar to 40-fold-changes in
   expression occur in important transcription factors, downstream gene
   regulation seems very stable in corals from day to night compared to
   other animals studied.},

Title = {Heat-Stress and Light-Stress Induce Different Cellular Pathologies in
   the Symbiotic Dinoflagellate during Coral Bleaching},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Coral bleaching is a significant contributor to the worldwide
   degradation of coral reefs and is indicative of the termination of
   symbiosis between the coral host and its symbiotic algae
   (dinoflagellate; Symbiodinium sp. complex), usually by expulsion or
   xenophagy (symbiophagy) of its dinoflagellates. Herein, we provide
   evidence that during the earliest stages of environmentally induced
   bleaching, heat stress and light stress generate distinctly different
   pathomorphological changes in the chloroplasts, while a combined
   heat-and light-stress exposure induces both pathomorphologies;
   suggesting that these stressors act on the dinoflagellate by different
   mechanisms. Within the first 48 hours of a heat stress (32 degrees C)
   under low-light conditions, heat stress induced decomposition of
   thylakoid structures before observation of extensive oxidative damage;
   thus it is the disorganization of the thylakoids that creates the
   conditions allowing photo-oxidative-stress. Conversely, during the first
   48 hours of a light stress (2007 mmoles m(-2) s(-1) PAR) at 25 degrees
   C, condensation or fusion of multiple thylakoid lamellae occurred
   coincidently with levels of oxidative damage products, implying that
   photo-oxidative stress causes the structural membrane damage within the
   chloroplasts. Exposure to combined heat-and light-stresses induced both
   pathomorphologies, confirming that these stressors acted on the
   dinoflagellate via different mechanisms. Within 72 hours of exposure to
   heat and/or light stresses, homeostatic processes (e. g., heat-shock
   protein and anti-oxidant enzyme response) were evident in the remaining
   intact dinoflagellates, regardless of the initiating stressor.
   Understanding the sequence of events during bleaching when triggered by
   different environmental stressors is important for predicting both
   severity and consequences of coral bleaching.},

Title = {Carbonic anhydrase activity changes in response to increased temperature
   and <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> in <i>Symbiodinium</i>-zoanthid associations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {473},
Pages = {218-226},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) makes up less than 1\% of dissolved inorganic
   carbon (DIC) in the ocean. To acquire carbon dioxide for photosynthesis,
   many marine autotrophs rely on the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) to
   catalyze the conversion of bicarbonate ions, (HCO3-) to CO2. In
   zoanthids and other cnidarians with Symbiodinium spp. endosymbionts, CA
   is essential for transporting CO2 to symbionts for photosynthesis.
   Temperature and ambient DIC affect CA activity, therefore, increased sea
   water temperatures and ocean acidification (OA) will alter CO2 transport
   in symbiotic cnidarians. However, these effects are likely to be species
   specific for both host and symbiont, as different cnidarians and
   Symbiodinium spp. vary in their mechanisms of DIC transport and
   utilization of CA. In this study, host and symbiont CA activity in the
   zoanthids Palythoa sp. and Zoanthus sp. varied with thermal stress and
   low pH. Increased temperature inhibited algal, but not host CA activity
   in Zoanthus sp. polyps with A4 Symbiodinium, while temperature had no
   effect on CA activity in Palythoa sp. with Cl Symbiodinium. High
   pCO(2)/low pH altered algal CA activity in both zoanthid species, but
   host CA activity changed in Zoanthus sp. polyps only. This study shows
   that thermal stress and OA induce species-specific changes in CA
   activity, and thus DIC transport in symbiotic zoanthids. These
   observations suggest that CA activity in symbiotic cnidarians will be
   altered by climate conditions predicted for the future, and for some
   cnidarians, changes in CA activity may inhibit photosynthesis. (C) 2015

Title = {Differential impact of heat stress on reef-building corals under
   different light conditions},
Journal = {MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {158},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Heat stress is an environmental factor that regularly challenges the
   well-being of living organisms. This study aims to examine the
   physiological changes happening in two reef-building coral species
   exposed to thermal stress under various light conditions. The two
   ecologically relevant heatwave scenarios were applied under ambient
   lights (high irradiance) and reduced light conditions (250 and < 10 mu
   mol photons m(-2) s(-1)). Corals were exposed to elevated temperatures
   of 32 degrees C (plus 6 degrees) for a period of 1 up to 5 days
   corresponding to heatwaves reported on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) that
   were associated with coral bleaching. We monitored changes in the
   physiological performance of these two coral species by measuring
   symbionts and corals' physiological parameters including symbiont
   density, levels of multiple algal pigments (chlorophyll a and
   peridinin), as well as the changes in the host protein concentration.
   During the short-term heat stress, both species were with stable
   physiological performance with the only exception of Stylophora
   pistillata under ambient lights. These results show that S. pistillata
   was negatively influenced by a synergistic effect of temperature and
   high irradiance resulting in the first signs of bleaching after only 24h
   of thermal stress. Exposure to prolonged thermal stress, characterised
   with a slower rate of temperature increase, affected both coral species
   investigated and resulted in bleaching mainly by day 5. Interestingly,
   severe light reduction (<10 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) made Acropora
   millepora corals more thermally sensitive and resulted in earlier signs
   of bleaching (on day 3). These findings indicate that there was a
   synergistic effect of very low lights and thermal stress that caused
   higher levels of bleaching in A. millepora. Our results revealed
   differential thermal sensitivity for two branching corals exposed to

Title = {Validation of parameters and protocols derived from chlorophyll <i>a</i>
   fluorescence commonly utilised in marine ecophysiological studies},
Journal = {FUNCTIONAL PLANT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 AUG 10},
Abstract = {This study documents the first validation of the suitability of the most
   common parameters and protocols used in marine ecophysiology to
   characterise photosynthesis by means of chlorophyll a fluorescence
   tools. We demonstrate that the effective yield of PSII (Delta F/F-m `)
   is significantly underestimated when using short inductions times (<= 1
   min) following the rapid light curve protocol (RLC). The consequent
   electron transport rates (ETR) underestimations are species-specific and
   highly variable with irradiance and the photoacclimatory condition of
   the sample. Our analysis also questions the use of relative descriptors
   (relETR), as they not only overestimate photosynthesis, but overlook one
   of the fundamental components of the photosynthetic response: light
   absorption regulation. Absorptance determinations were fundamental to
   characterise the ETR response of low-pigmented seagrass leaves, and also
   uncovered relevant differences between two coral species and the
   accclimatory response of a cultured dinoflagellate to temperature. ETR
   and oxygen evolution determinations showed close correlations for all
   organisms tested with the expected slope of 4 e(-) per O-2 molecule
   evolved, when correct photosynthesis inductions and light absorption
   determinations were applied. However, ETR curves cannot be equated to
   conventional photosynthetic response to irradiance (P vs E) curves, and
   caution is needed when using ETR to characterise photosynthesis rates
   above photosynthesis saturation (E-k). This validation strongly supports
   the utility of fluorescence tools, underlining the need to correct two
   decades of propagation of erroneous concepts, protocols and parameters
   in marine eco-physiology. We aim also to emphasise the importance of
   optical descriptions for understanding photosynthesis, and for
   interpreting fluorescence measurements. In combination with conventional
   gross photosynthesis (GPS) approaches, optical characterisations open an
   extraordinary opportunity to determine two central parameters of
   photosynthesis performance: the quantum yield ((max)) of the process and
   its minimum quantum requirements (1/(max)). The combination of both
   approaches potentiates the possibilities of chlorophyll a fluorescence
   tools to characterise marine photosynthesis biodiversity.},

Title = {Changing light levels induce photo-oxidative stress and alterations in
   shell density of <i>Amphistegina lobifera</i> (Foraminifera)},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {549},
Pages = {69-78},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {Light is an important factor limiting the distribution of holobiont
   (host-algae) organisms in marine environments. Reef-dwelling large
   benthic foraminifera (LBF) are particularly sensitive to changes in
   light exposure, but their cryptic behaviour allows them to colonise
   different habitats across a light gradient. Yet, how foraminifera of the
   same species that live in different habitats respond to variations in
   light conditions, and the physiological and morphological attributes
   that govern that response, remain unclear. Here, we investigate how
   Amphistegina lobifera, a common and abundant LBF species in reef
   environments, collected from different reef sites across a light
   gradient, respond to changing light levels under lab-controlled
   conditions. Reduced light below their optimum level for growth and
   calcification caused a significant reduction in antioxidant capacity,
   and a significant decline in the density of newly added chambers. In
   contrast, elevated light caused significant reduction in survivorship,
   induced bleaching and photo-oxidative stress, and caused thickening of
   external chambers. Reef site did not have a significant effect on most
   of the responses, and populations collected from different reef sites
   showed similar sensitivity to changes in irradiance below and above
   their optimum level. The capacity to regulate symbiont density and to
   host a diversity of symbiotic diatoms within Amphistegina could be a
   reason for their ability to acclimate rapidly to different light levels.
   However, prolonged exposure to reduced light may result in a decrease in
   shell density and, as a consequence, a decline in carbonate production
   in reef environments.},

Title = {Effect of acclimatization to low temperature and reduced light on the

Number = {9},
Pages = {1797-1808},

Abstract = {This study tested the effects of acclimatization on the response of
   corals to elevated temperature, using juvenile massive Porites spp. and
   branching P. irregularis from Moorea (W149A degrees 50', S17A degrees
   30'). During April and May 2006, corals were acclimatized for 15 days to
   cool (25.7A degrees C) or ambient (27.7A degrees C) temperature, under
   shaded (352 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) or ambient (554 mu mol photons
   m(-2) s(-1)) natural light, and then incubated for 7 days at ambient or
   high temperature (31.1A degrees C), under ambient light (659 mu mol
   photons m(-2) s(-1)). The response to acclimatization was assessed as
   biomass, maximum dark-adapted quantum yield of PSII (F (v)/F (m)), and
   growth, and the effect of the subsequent treatment was assessed as F
   (v)/F (m) and growth. Relative to the controls (i.e., ambient
   temperature/ambient light), massive Porites spp. responded to
   acclimatization through increases in biomass under ambient
   temperature/shade, and low temperature/ambient light, whereas P.
   irregularis responded through reduced growth under ambient
   temperature/shade, and low temperature/ambient light. Acclimatization
   affected the response to thermal stress for massive Porites spp. (but
   not P. irregularis), with an interaction between the acclimatization and
   subsequent treatments for growth. This interaction resulted from a
   lessening of the negative effects of high temperature after
   acclimatizing to ambient temperature/shade, but an accentuation of the
   effect after acclimatizing to low temperature/shade. It is possible that
   changes in biomass for massive Porites spp. are important in modulating
   the response to high temperature, with the taxonomic variation in this
   effect potentially resulting from differences in morphology. These
   results demonstrate that corals can acclimatize during short exposures
   to downward excursions in temperature and light, which subsequently
   affects their response to thermal stress. Moreover, even con-generic
   taxa differ in this capacity, which could affect coral community
   structure.},

Abstract = {Animals acquire photosynthetically-fixed carbon by forming symbioses
   with algae and cyanobacteria. These associations are widespread in the
   phyla Porifera (sponges) and Cnidaria (corals, sea anemones etc.) but
   otherwise uncommon or absent from animal phyla. It is suggested that one
   factor contributing to the distribution of animal symbioses is the
   morphologically-simple body plan of the Porifera and Cnidaria with a
   large surface area:volume relationship well-suited to light capture by
   symbiotic algae in their tissues. Photosynthetic products are released
   from living symbiont cells to the animal host at substantial rates.
   Research with algal cells freshly isolated from the symbioses suggests
   that low molecular weight compounds (e.g. maltose, glycerol) are the
   major release products but further research is required to assess the
   relevance of these results to the algae in the intact symbiosis.
   Photosynthesis also poses risks for the animal because environmental
   perturbations, especially elevated temperature or irradiance, can lead
   to the production of reactive oxygen species, damage to membranes and
   proteins, and `bleaching', including breakdown of the symbiosis. The
   contribution of non-photochemical quenching and membrane lipid
   composition of the algae to bleaching susceptibility is assessed. More
   generally, the development of genomic techniques to help understand the
   processes underlying the function and breakdown of function in
   photosynthetic symbioses is advocated.},

Title = {Different Stress Tolerances of Juveniles of the Coral <i>Acropora
   tenuis</i> Associated with Clades C1 and D <i>Symbiodinium</i>},
Journal = {ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {55},
Abstract = {Reef-building corals are often associated with multiple clades of
   symbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium spp., where the relative
   composition of Symbiodinium can alter the phylogenetic properties (e.g.,
   stress responsiveness, growth rate) of the host coral. The genus
   Symbiodinium contains nine clades, some of which behave differently in
   response to strong light and/or temperature stresses, for example, clade
   D Symbiodinium are thermally tolerant. However, previous studies are
   based on corals present in the field, and it is possible that the corals
   used in previous experiments did not contain single Symbiodinium clades.
   For an accurate assessment of the effects of each Symbiodinium clade on
   host thermal stress resistance, monoclonal cultures of clades C1 and D
   were inoculated into aposymbiotic juvenile polyps. Photosynthetic
   efficiency (maximum quantum yield: F-v/F-m) showed a decline at 30
   degrees C than at 25 degrees C in both clades. Symbiodinium clade C1
   showed a consistently higher rETRmax with larger fluctuations than clade
   D, with a lower survival rate of juveniles during thermal stress
   treatment. Under strong light exposure, corals containing clade C1
   showed a greater decline in F-v/F-m (-74\%), compared to decline in
   corals associated with clade D (-50\%) after 3 hours. This is the first
   study to assess stress tolerances of juvenile corals in association with
   the monoclonal Symbiodinium clades C and D, and our results indicated
   greater tolerance of corals associated with clade D to strong light (500
   mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). However, it is difficult to determine the impact of
   high-temperature stress on coral-algae symbiosis from photosynthetic
   activity. At high temperatures, clade C1 Symbiodinium exhibited high
   photosynthetic activity, but host survival rates were higher in corals
   associated with clade D Symbiodinium. Since clade C1 has a relatively
   high photosynthetic activity under high temperatures, clade C1 symbiosis
   at high temperatures might have a negative impact on corals compared
   with clade D.},

Title = {The determination of activity of the enzyme Rubisco in cell extracts of

Abstract = {The dinoflagellate alga Symbiodinium sp., living in symbiosis with
   corals, clams and other invertebrates, is a primary producer in coral
   reefs and other marine ecosystems. The function of the carbon-fixing
   enzyme ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) in
   dinoflagellates is difficult to study because its activity is rapidly
   lost after extraction from the cell. We report procedures for the
   extraction of Rubisco from Symbiodinium cells and for stable storage. We
   describe a continuous assay for Rubisco activity in these crude cell
   extracts using the Mn2+ chemiluminescence of Rubisco oxygenase.
   Chemiluminescence time courses exhibited initial transients resembling
   bacterial Form II Rubisco, followed by several minutes of linearly
   decreasing activity. The initial activity was determined from
   extrapolation of this linear section of the time course. The activity of
   fast-frozen cell extracts was stable at -80 degrees C and, after thawing
   and storage on ice, remained stable for up to 1 h before declining
   non-linearly. Crude cell extracts bound {[}14C] 2-carboxy-D-arabitinol
   1,5-bisphosphate to a high molecular mass fraction separable by gel
   filtration chromatography. After pre-treatment of Symbiodinium cell
   cultures in darkness at temperatures above 30 degrees C, the extracted
   Rubisco activities decreased, with almost complete loss of activity
   above 36 degrees C. The implications for the sensitivity to elevated
   temperature of Symbiodinium photosynthesis are assessed.},

Title = {Photosynthetic activity of the solar-powered lagoon mollusc <i>Elysia
   timida</i> (Risso, 1818) (Opisthobranchia: Sacoglossa)},
Journal = {SYMBIOSIS},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3},
Pages = {151-158},
Abstract = {The sacoglossan Elysia timida (Risso, 1818) is typical of shallow sea
   areas and coastal lagoons. It retains symbiotic functional chloroplasts
   derived from its algal food Acetabularia acetabulum (Linnaeus) for 45
   days. However, some aspects of the photosynthetic behaviour of the
   mollusc-chloroplast association are unknown. This work studies the
   photosynthetic characteristics of E. timida from a lagoon environment
   (Mar Menor), defined between 25 and 600 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1) by the
   photosynthetic-irradiance curve. Experimental data were fitted to
   different exponential models and models based on Michaelis-Menten
   kinetics. Among the latter, the model that bests fits to the
   experimental data was identified. Furthermore, it incorporates
   respiration values and allows an estimation of compensation irradiance
   (I-c: 11.89 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)). This model showed a rapid
   saturation of the photosynthetic apparatus at relatively low irradiance
   values (I-k: 31.33 mu mol quanta m(-2)). Excess light seems to be
   modulated by the mollusc's opening and closing of their parapodia. Mean
   P/R values (Production versus Respiration relationship) are above 0.91;
   considered high in coral-zooxanthellae symbioses. The photosynthetic
   efficiency of the symbiotic chloroplasts is fairly high, taking into
   account that sacoglossans are more active than corals and have a higher
   respiration rate.},

Title = {Potential Costs of Acclimatization to a Warmer Climate: Growth of a Reef
   Coral with Heat Tolerant vs. Sensitive Symbiont Types},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {One of the principle ways in which reef building corals are likely to
   cope with a warmer climate is by changing to more thermally tolerant
   endosymbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) genotypes. It is highly likely that
   hosting a more heat-tolerant algal genotype will be accompanied by
   tradeoffs in the physiology of the coral. To better understand one of
   these tradeoffs, growth was investigated in the Indo-Pacific
   reef-building coral Acropora millepora in both the laboratory and the
   field. In the Keppel Islands in the southern Great Barrier Reef this
   species naturally harbors nrDNA ITS1 thermally sensitive type C2 or
   thermally tolerant type D zooxanthellae of the genus Symbiodinium and
   can change dominant type following bleaching. We show that under
   controlled conditions, corals with type D symbionts grow 29\% slower
   than those with type C2 symbionts. In the field, type D colonies grew
   38\% slower than C2 colonies. These results demonstrate the magnitude of
   trade-offs likely to be experienced by this species as they acclimatize
   to warmer conditions by changing to more thermally tolerant type D
   zooxanthellae. Irrespective of symbiont genotype, corals were affected
   to an even greater degree by the stress of a bleaching event which
   reduced growth by more than 50\% for up to 18 months compared to
   pre-bleaching rates. The processes of symbiont change and acute thermal
   stress are likely to act in concert on coral growth as reefs acclimatize
   to more stressful warmer conditions, further compromising their
   regeneration capacity following climate change.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},

Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {The effects of seagrass on microalgal assemblages under experimentally
   elevated temperatures (28 degrees C) and CO2 partial pressures (pCO(2);
   800 mu atm) were examined using coral reef mesocosms. Concentrations of
   nitrate, ammonium, and benthic microalgal chlorophyll a (chl-a) were
   significantly higher in seagrass mesocosms, whereas phytoplankton chl-a
   concentrations were similar between seagrass and seagrass-free control
   mesocosms. In the seagrass group, fewer parasitic dinoflagellate OTUs
   (e.g., Syndiniales) were found in the benthic microalgal community
   though more symbiotic dinoflagellates (e.g., Cladocopium spp.) were
   quantified in the phytoplankton community. Our results suggest that,
   under ocean acidification conditions, the presence of seagrass nearby
   coral reefs may (1) enhance benthic primary productivity, (2) decrease
   parasitic dinoflagellate abundance, and (3) possibly increase the
   presence of symbiotic dinoflagellates.},

Journal = {LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY},

Volume = {65},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Dinoflagellates within the family Symbiodiniaceae are widespread and
   fuel metabolism of reef-forming corals through photosynthesis.
   Adaptation in capacity to harvest and utilize light, and ``safely{''}
   process photosynthetically generated energy is a key factor regulating
   their broad ecological success. However, whether such adaptive capacity
   similarly extends to how Symbiodiniaceae species and genotypes
   assimilate inorganic carbon (Ci) remains unexplored. We build on recent
   approaches exploring functional diversity of fitness traits to identify
   whether Ci uptake and incorporation could be reconciled with
   evolutionary adaptation among Symbiodiniaceae. We examined
   phylogenetically diverse Symbiodiniaceae cultures (23 isolates, 6
   genera) to track how carbon was invested into cellular uptake,
   excretion, and growth (cell size, division, storage). Gross carbon
   uptake rates (GPC) over 1 h varied among isolates grown at 26 degrees C
   (0.63-3.08 pg C {[}cell h](-1)) with no evident pattern with algal
   phylogeny. Intriguingly, net carbon uptake rates (24 h) were often
   higher (1.01-5.54 pg C {[}cell h](-1)) than corresponding values of
   GPC-we discuss how such GPC measurements may reflect highly conserved
   biological characteristics for cultured cells linked to high metabolic
   dependency on photorespiration and heterotrophy. Three isolates from
   different genera (Cladocopium goreaui, Durusdinium trenchii, and
   Effrenium voratum) were additionally grown at 20 degrees C and 30
   degrees C. Here, Ci uptake consistently decreased with
   temperature-driven declines in growth rate, suggesting environmental
   regulation outweighs phylogenetic organization of carbon assimilation
   capacity among Symbiodiniaceae. Together, these data demonstrate
   environmental regulation and ecological success among Symbiodiniaceae
   likely rests on plasticity of upstream photosynthetic processes (light
   harvesting, energy quenching, etc.) to overcome evolutionary-conserved
   limitations in Ci functioning.},

Title = {Physiological response of Symbiodiniaceae to thermal stress: Reactive

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 3},
Abstract = {This study investigates the physiological response to heat stress of
   three genetically different Symbiodiniaceae strains isolated from the
   scleractinian coral Mussismilia braziliensis, endemic of the Abrolhos
   Bank, Brazil. Cultures of two Symbiodinium sp. and one Cladocopium sp.
   were exposed to a stepwise increase in temperature (2 \& DEG;C every
   second day) ranging from 26 \& DEG;C (modal temperature in Abrolhos) to
   32 \& DEG;C (just above the maximum temperature registered in Abrolhos
   during the third global bleaching event-TGBE). After the cultures
   reached their final testing temperature, reactive oxygen species (ROS)
   production, single cell attributes (relative cell size and chlorophyll
   fluorescence), and photosynthetic efficiency (effective (Y(II)) and
   maximum (F-v/F-m) quantum yields) were measured within 4 h and 72 h.
   Non-photochemical coefficient (NPQ) was estimated based on fluorescence
   values. Population average ROS production was variable across strains
   and exposure times, reaching up a 2-fold increase at 32 \& DEG;C in one
   of the Symbiodinium sp. strains. A marked intrapopulation difference was
   observed in ROS production, with 5 to 25\% of the cells producing up to
   10 times more than the population average, highlighting the importance
   of single cell approaches to assess population physiology. Average cell
   size increases at higher temperatures, likely resulting from cell cycle
   arrest, whereas chlorophyll fluorescence decreased, especially in 4 h,
   indicating a photoacclimation response. The conditions tested do not
   seem to have elicited loss of photosynthetic efficiency nor the
   activation of non-photochemical mechanisms in the cells. Our results
   unveiled a generalized thermotolerance in three Symbiodiniaceae strains
   originated from Abrolhos' corals. Inter and intra-specific variability
   could be detected, likely reflecting the genetic differences among the
   strains.},

Abstract = {In order to examine the potential interactive pressures of local
   pollution and global climate change, we exposed corals and crustose
   coralline algae (CCA) to three agricultural photosystem II (PSII)
   herbicides at four temperatures (26-32 degrees C). The coral Acropora
   millepora was 3- to 10-fold more sensitive to the three herbicides than
   the CCA Neogoniolithon fosliei. While the photosynthesis of CCA was not
   affected by the herbicide concentrations used (< 1 mu g L-1),
   temperatures of 31 degrees C and 32 degrees C alone significantly
   inhibited photosynthetic efficiency (Delta F: F-m') and caused chronic
   photoinhibition (reduced F-v : F-m) and substantial bleaching.
   Environmentally relevant concentrations of each herbicide increased the
   negative effects of thermal stress on coral at 31 degrees C and 32
   degrees C. Mixed model analyses of variance showed that the effects of
   elevated sea surface temperatures (SST) and herbicide on photosynthetic
   efficiency of coral symbionts were additive. Furthermore, the effect of
   either diuron or atrazine in combination with higher SST (31 degrees C
   and 32 degrees C) on chronic photoinhibition was distinctly greater than
   additive (synergistic). Reducing the herbicide concentration by 1 mu g
   L-1 diuron above 30 degrees C would protect photosynthetic efficiency by
   the equivalent of 1.8 degrees C and reduce chronic photoinhibition by
   the equivalent of a 1 degrees C reduction. Reduced water quality
   increases the vulnerability of corals to elevated SSTs, and effective
   management of local water quality can reduce negative effects of global
   stressors such as elevated SST.},

Abstract = {Several environmental factors have been described to trigger bleaching
   in cnidarian/dinoflagellate endosymbiosis. However, the molecular
   mechanisms underlying this process still need more investigations.
   Symbiosis breakdown is known to result from physiological damage to
   animal host cells and/or symbionts. Cellular oxidation appears to be an
   essential player in this damage. Indeed, oxidative stress is a direct
   consequence of increase in irradiance and temperature, the two main
   environmental factors involved in bleaching. In this study, we examined
   the role of irradiance in inducing dissociation and oxidative stress in
   cnidarians and dinoflagellates. We used the bleaching-sensitive
   scleractinian coral Pocillopora verrucosa in a field
   cross-transplantation experiment performed between 5 in and 20 in depth
   at Grande Glorieuse Island (Indian Ocean), a preserved area subject to
   minimal anthropogenic influence. Cellular damage and increase in
   antioxidant defense were correlated with bleaching in upward
   transplanted samples. Downward transplanted colonies presented no
   associated alterations similar to the controls. We therefore conclude
   that increasing light induced bleaching via a prooxidative period.
   Remarkably, the distribution of Symbiodinium over depth was invariant;
   all colonies were monomorph for clade C, suggesting that bleaching
   sensitivity of R verrucosa might not be associated with clade
   specificity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Tissue biomass (ash-free dry weight) and symbiotic dinoflagellates
   (density, chlorophyll a cell(-1) or cm(-2) of coral surface area) of
   five species of reef-building corals were monitored seasonally for up to
   4 yr at three different depths in the Bahamas. The lowest values of all
   tissue biomass and algal symbiont parameters occurred during the late
   summer-fall sample periods. In contrast, the highest densities and
   pigment content of symbionts usually occurred during the winter, whereas
   tissue biomass peaked most often in the spring, the time lag implying a
   functional relationship between these variables. Corals living in
   shallow water often (but not always) had higher levels of all parameters
   measured compared to deeper corals, except chlorophyll a content, which
   usually displayed the opposite trend. The results show that corals from
   all depths exhibited bleaching (loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates and/or
   their pigments) every year, regardless of whether they appeared white,
   tan, or mottled to the human eye. We speculate that these patterns are
   driven by seasonal changes in light and temperature on algal and animal
   physiology. Furthermore, we hypothesize that all tropical reef-building
   corals, world-wide, exhibit similar predictable cycles in their tissue
   biomass and symbiotic algae.},

Abstract = {The threats of wide-scale coral bleaching and reef demise associated
   with anthropogenic climate change are widely known. Moreover, rates of
   genetic adaptation and/or changes in the coral-zooxanthella partnerships
   are considered unlikely to be sufficiently fast for corals to acquire
   increased physiological resistance to increasing sea temperatures and
   declining pH. However, it has been suggested that coral reef resilience
   to climate change may be improved by good local management of coral
   reefs, including management of water quality. Here, using major data
   sets from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, we investigate
   geographic patterns of coral bleaching in 1998 and 2002 and outline a
   synergism between heat stress and nutrient flux as a major causative
   mechanism for those patterns. The study provides the first concrete
   evidence for the oft-expressed belief that improved coral reef
   management will increase the regional-scale survival prospects of coral
   reefs to global climate change.},

Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {31},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Elevated temperatures in combination with moderate to high irradiance
   are known to cause bleaching events in scleractinian corals,
   characterised by damage to photosystem II (PSII). Photoprotective
   mechanisms of the symbiont can reduce the excitation pressure impinging
   upon PSII. In the bleaching sensitive species, Acropora millepora and
   Pocillopora damicornis, high light alone induced photoprotection through
   the xanthophyll cycle, increased content of the antioxidant carotenoid,
   beta-carotene, as well as the dissociation of the light-harvesting
   chlorophyll complexes. The evidence is compatible with either the
   membrane-bound chlorophyll a-chlorophyll c (2)-peridinin-protein (acpPC)
   complex or the peripheral peridinin-chlorophyll-protein complex, or
   both, disconnecting from PSII under high light. The acpPC complex
   potentially showed a state transition response with redistribution
   towards photosystem I to reduce PSII over-excitation. This apparent
   acpPC dissociation/reassociation was promoted by the addition of the
   xanthophyll cycle inhibitor, dithiothreitol, under high irradiance.
   Exposure to thermal stress as well as high light promoted xanthophyll
   de-epoxidation and increased beta-carotene content, although it did not
   influence light-harvesting chlorophyll complex (LHC) dissociation,
   indicating light, rather than temperature, controls LHC dissociation.
   Photoinhibition was avoided in the bleaching tolerant species, Pavona
   decussata, suggesting xanthophyll cycling along with LHC dissociation
   may have been sufficient to prevent photodamage to PSII. Symbionts of P.
   decussata also displayed the greatest detachment of antenna complexes,
   while the more thermally sensitive species, Pocillopora damicornis and
   A. millepora, showed less LHC dissociation, suggesting antenna movement
   influences bleaching susceptibility.},

Title = {Is citrate synthase an energy biomarker in Southwestern Atlantic corals?
   A comparative, biochemical approach under a simulated scenario of
   climate change},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Southwestern Atlantic (SWA) corals are more tolerant to global
   warming than those from the Caribbean Sea, possibly due to their higher
   heterotrophy and flexibility of symbiotic associations in nutrient-rich
   waters. Increased heterotrophy promotes greater energy gain via
   increased mitochondrial respiration, which can be used to face
   unfavorable conditions. Citrate synthase (CS) is a pacemaker enzyme of
   cellular respiration, and its activity can be used as a proxy for
   maximum aerobic capacity, thus being a potential predictor of organism
   tolerance against climate change. Therefore, we hypothesized that
   endemic coral species from SWA would have higher CS activity than those
   of pan-Caribbean distribution after exposure to a simulated scenario of
   moderate climate change (seawater temperature increase: + 2.5 degrees C;
   seawater acidification: - 0.3 pH unit), according to IPCC. Seven species
   of scleractinian corals and one hydrocoral species were biochemically
   evaluated in a phylogenetic perspective. Favia gravida, Mussismilia
   harttii, Montastraea cavernosa, Porites astreoides and Siderastrea
   stellata were unresponsive regarding CS activity, whereas Millepora
   alcicornis, Mussismilia hispida and Porites branneri showed a
   compensatory effect. Regardless of their phylogenetic relationships,
   endemic SWA coral species revealed higher CS activity than those of
   pan-Caribbean distribution. We suggest that the unique evolutionary
   history of SWA endemic species contributes to their biochemical
   tolerance to climate change, thus supporting the hypothesis of SWA as a
   refuge for reef life. Although CS is not a suitable biomarker for
   assessing the putative effects of climate change owing to its
   species-specific responses, it is an informative metric to indicate
   stress tolerance of species with different biogeographic origins. This
   idea becomes particularly evident for SWA reefs, where such a
   comparative, biochemical approach highlights the greater tolerance of
   endemic species at the subcellular level of organization.},

Title = {Physiological correlates of symbiont migration during bleaching of two

Abstract = {Perturbed colonies of Phenganax parrini and Sarcothelia sp. exhibit
   migration of symbionts of Symbiodinium spp. into the stolons.
   Densitometry and visual inspection indicated that polyps bleached while
   stolons did not. When migration was triggered by temperature, light and
   confinement, colonies of Sarcothelia sp. decreased rates of oxygen
   formation in the light (due to the effects of perturbation on
   photosynthesis and respiration) and increased rates of oxygen uptake in
   the dark (due to the effects of perturbation on respiration alone).
   Colonies of P. parrini, by contrast, showed no significant changes in
   either aspect of oxygen metabolism. When migration was triggered by
   light and confinement, colonies of Sarcothelia sp. showed decreased
   rates of oxygen formation in the light and increased rates of oxygen
   uptake in the dark, while colonies of P. parrini maintained the former
   and increased the latter. During symbiont migration into their stolons,
   colonies of both species showed dramatic increases in reactive oxygen
   species (ROS), as visualized with a fluorescent probe, with stolons of
   Sarcothelia sp. exhibiting a nearly immediate increase of ROS.
   Differences in symbiont type may explain the greater sensitivity of
   colonies of Sarcothelia sp. Using fluorescent probes, direct
   measurements of migrating symbionts in the stolons of Sarcothelia sp.
   showed higher levels of reactive nitrogen species and lower levels of
   ROS than the surrounding host tissue. As measured by native
   fluorescence, levels of NAD(P) H in the stolons were unaffected by
   perturbation. Symbiont migration thus correlates with dramatic
   physiological changes and may serve as a marker for coral condition.},

Title = {Response of Subtropical Coastal Sediment Systems of Okinawa, Japan, to
   Experimental Warming and High <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub>},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {Increasing seawater temperatures and CO2 levels associated with climate
   change affect the shallow marine ecosystem function. In this study, the
   effects of elevated seawater temperature and partial pressure of CO2
   (pCO(2)) on subtropical sediment systems of mangrove, seagrass, and
   coral reef lagoon habitats of Okinawa, Japan, were examined. Sediment
   and seawater from each habitat were exposed to four pCO(2)-temperature
   treatments, including ambient pCO(2)- ambient temperature, ambient
   pCO(2)-high temperature (ambient temperature + 4 degrees C), high pCO(2)
   (936 ppm)-ambient temperature, and high pCO(2)-high temperature.
   Parameters including primary production, nutrient flux, pigment content,
   photosynthetic community composition, and bacterial abundance were
   examined. Neither high temperature nor high pCO(2) alone impacted
   mangrove and seagrass sediment primary production significantly (Tukey's
   test, P > 0.05). However, the combined stress significantly (Tukey's
   test, P < 0.01) increased primary production in these two habitats. In
   sediments from the coral reef lagoon, single and combined stress
   treatments induced a shift from heterotrophy to autotrophy. Significant
   increases in net primary production (Tukey's test, P < 0.01), and gross
   primary production (Tukey's test, P < 0.05) under the combined stress
   suggested that benthic microalgae in mangrove and seagrass sediments
   were more responsive to high temperature and pCO(2) conditions than
   those in coral reef lagoon sediments. Additionally, combined stress
   significantly increased the sediment chlorophyll a content (Tukey's
   test, P < 0.05) in all habitats. These increases were associated with
   increased net primary production, indicating that combined stress
   stimulates primary production activity by the photosynthetic benthic
   microalgae in all habitats. Diatom activity increased, as silicate
   uptake increased in all habitats. Microbial abundance significantly
   increased under the combined stress treatment (Tukey's test, P < 0.01),
   but did not exceed autotrophic activity. Respiration did not change
   significantly in any of the three habitats (Tukey's test, P > 0.05)
   under the combined stress, suggesting that heterotrophic processes were
   less affected by the combined stress than autotrophic processes. In
   summary, mangrove and seagrass sediments minimize the negative impacts
   of elevated temperature and pCO(2) via increased primary production and
   carbon storage. Lagoonal sediments also act as a carbon sink under
   temperature and ocean acidificationstress.},

Title = {The Effect of Thermal Stress on the Bacterial Microbiome of
   <i>Exaiptasia diaphana</i>},
Journal = {MICROORGANISMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Coral bleaching linked to climate change has generated interest in the
   response of coral's bacterial microbiome to thermal stress. The sea
   anemone, Exaiptasia diaphana, is a popular coral model, but the response
   of its bacteria to thermal stress has been barely explored. To address
   this, we compared the bacterial communities of Great Barrier Reef (GBR)
   E. diaphana maintained at 26 degrees C or exposed to increasing
   temperature (26-33 degrees C) over two weeks. Communities were analyzed
   by metabarcoding of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Bleaching and
   Symbiodiniaceae health were assessed by Symbiodiniaceae cell density and
   dark-adapted quantum yield (F-v/F-m), respectively. Significant
   bleaching and reductions in F-v/F-m occurred in the heat-treated
   anemones above 29 degrees C. Overall declines in bacterial alpha
   diversity in all anemones were also observed. Signs of bacterial change
   emerged above 31 degrees C. Some initial outcomes may have been
   influenced by relocation or starvation, but collectively, the bacterial
   community and taxa-level data suggested that heat was the primary driver
   of change above 32 degrees C. Six bacterial indicator species were
   identified as potential biomarkers for thermal stress. We conclude that
   the bacterial microbiome of GBR E. diaphana is generally stable until a
   thermal threshold is surpassed, after which significant changes occur.},

Title = {Thermal and Herbicide Tolerances of Chromerid Algae and Their Ability to
   Form a Symbiosis With Corals},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {FEB 12},
Abstract = {Reef-building corals form an obligate symbiosis with photosynthetic
   microalgae in the family Symbiodiniaceae that meet most of their energy
   requirements. This symbiosis is under threat from the unprecedented rate
   of ocean warming as well as the simultaneous pressure of local stressors
   such as poor water quality. Only 1 degrees C above mean summer sea
   surface temperatures (SSTs) on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) can trigger
   the loss of Symbiodiniaceae from the host, and very low concentrations
   of the most common herbicide, diuron, can disrupt the photosynthetic
   activity of microalgae. In an era of rapid environmental change,
   investigation into the assisted evolution of the coral holobiont is
   underway in an effort to enhance the resilience of corals.
   Apicomplexan-like microalgae were discovered in 2008 and the Phylum
   Chromerida (chromerids) was created. Chromerids have been isolated from
   corals and contain a functional photosynthetic plastid. Their discovery
   therefore opens a new avenue of research into the use of
   alternative/additional photosymbionts of corals. However, only two
   studies to-date have investigated the symbiotic nature of Chromera velia
   with corals and thus little is known about the coral-chromerid
   relationship. Furthermore, the response of chromerids to environmental
   stressors has not been examined. Here we tested the performance of four
   chromerid strains and the common dinofiagellate symbiont Cladocopium
   goreaui (formerly Symbiodinium goreaui, ITS2 type C1) in response to
   elevated temperature, diuron and their combined exposure. Three of the
   four chromerid strains exhibited high thermal tolerances and two strains
   showed exceptional herbicide tolerances, greater than observed for any
   photosynthetic microalgae, including C. goreaui. We also investigated
   the onset of symbiosis between the chromerids and larvae of two common
   GBR coral species under ambient and stress conditions. Levels of
   colonization of coral larvae with the chromerid strains were low
   compared to colonization with C. goreaui. We did not observe any overall
   negative or positive larval fitness effects of the inoculation with
   chromerid algae vs. C. goreaui. However, we cannot exclude the
   possibility that chromerid algae may have more important roles in later
   coral life stages and recommend this be the focus of future studies.},

   scanned corals},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAY 22},
Abstract = {Reef building corals are efficient biological collectors of solar
   radiation and consist of a thin stratified tissue layer spread over a
   light scattering calcium carbonate skeleton surface that together
   construct complex three dimensional (3D) colony structures forming the
   foundation of coral reefs. They exhibit a vast diversity of structural
   forms to maximize photosynthesis of their dinoflagellate endosymbionts
   (Symbiodiniaceae), while simultaneously minimizing photodamage, offer
   resistance to hydrodynamic stress, reduce attack by predators and
   increase prey capture and heterotrophic feeding. The symbiosis takes
   place in the presence of dynamic gradients of light, temperature and
   chemical species that are affected by the interaction of incident
   irradiance and water flow with the coral colony. We developed a
   multiphysics modelling approach to simulate the microscale spatial
   distribution of light, temperature and O-2 in a coral fragment with its
   morphology determined by 3D scanning techniques. Model results compared
   well with spatial measurements of light, O-2 and temperature under
   similar flow and light conditions. The model enabled us to infer the
   effect of coral morphology and light scattering in tissue and skeleton
   on the internal light environment experienced by the endosymbionts, as
   well as the combined contribution of light, water flow and ciliary
   movement on O-2 and temperature distributions in the coral.},

Abstract = {We assessed the in situ daily primary production, photosynthetic
   efficiency, and xanthophyll cycling of a temperate coral, Cladocora
   caespitosa, during the summer using an in situ incubation chamber
   equipped with temperature, oxygen, light, salinity, and pH sensors.
   During sunny days, photosynthetic carbon (C) production rates of C.
   caespitosa can be as high as those measured for tropical corals and
   rapidly follow changes in natural irradiance (from 200 to 1000 mu mol
   photons m(-2) s(-1) within 2 h). As a consequence, daily production
   rates varied by a factor of 2 (from 150 and 260 mu g C cm(-2) d(-1))
   depending on the irradiance received. Under high irradiance levels,
   corals can suffer from photoinhibition (light-induced reduction in the
   photosynthetic capacity), especially temperate species, which do not
   experience high irradiance levels most of the year. However, in C.
   caespitosa, photoinhibition at irradiances higher than 1000 mmol photons
   m(-2) s(-1) was reduced as a result of the involvement of the
   xanthophyll cycle, with a degree comparable to those measured for
   tropical species (de-epoxidation ratio of 0.12), that allowed C.
   caespitosa to maintain high production rates and a maximal autotrophic
   carbon acquisition during sunny days. However, as soon as irradiance
   conditions decreased below 200 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) because of
   cloudy weather, autotrophically acquired carbon could not sustain
   respiratory needs, indicating that C. caespitosa has to rely on other

Abstract = {The onset of symbiosis and the early development of most broadcast
   spawning corals play pivotal roles in recruitment success, yet these
   critical early stages are threatened by multiple stressors. However,
   molecular mechanisms governing these critical processes under ocean
   warming and acidification are still poorly understood. The present study
   investigated the interactive impact of elevated temperature (similar to
   28.0 degrees C and similar to 30.5 degrees C) and partial pressure of
   carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) (similar to 600 and similar to 1,200 mu atm) on
   early development and the gene expression patterns in juvenileAcropora
   intermediaover 33 days. The results showed that coral survival was >89\%
   and was unaffected by high temperature,pCO(2), or the combined
   treatment. Notably, high temperature completely arrested successful
   symbiosis establishment and the budding process, whereas acidification
   had a negligible effect. Moreover, there was a positive exponential
   relationship between symbiosis establishment and budding rates (y=
   0.0004e(6.43x),R= 0.72,P< 0.0001), which indicated the importance of
   symbiosis in fueling asexual budding. Compared with corals at the
   control temperature (28 degrees C), those under elevated temperature
   preferentially harboredDurusdiniumspp., despite unsuccessful symbiosis
   establishment. In addition, compared to the control, 351 and 153
   differentially expressed genes were detected in the symbiont and coral
   host in response to experimental conditions, respectively. In coral
   host, some genes involved in nutrient transportation and tissue
   fluorescence were affected by high temperature. In the symbionts, a
   suite of genes related to cell growth, ribosomal proteins,
   photosynthesis, and energy production was downregulated under high
   temperatures, which may have severely hampered successful cell
   proliferation of the endosymbionts and explains the failure of symbiosis
   establishment. Therefore, our results suggest that the responses of
   symbionts to future ocean conditions could play a vital role in shaping
   successful symbiosis in juvenile coral.},

Abstract = {Rising ocean temperatures disrupt the symbiosis between corals and their
   microalgae, accelerating global decline of coral reef ecosystems.
   Because of the difficulty of performing laboratory experiments with
   corals, the sea anemone Aiptasia has emerged as an important model
   system for molecular studies of coral bleaching and symbiosis. Here, we
   investigate natural variation in bleaching responses among different
   genetic lineages of Aiptasia. Both heat- and cold-induced paths to
   symbiosis breakdown were analyzed. Significant genetic variation in
   response to acute heat stress was observed, with severe bleaching of two
   Aiptasia strains from Hawaii but minimal bleaching of strains from the
   U.S. South Atlantic, including the strain used to generate the Aiptasia
   reference genome. Both strains from Hawaii hosted Symbiodinium type B1,
   whereas strains from the U.S. South Atlantic hosted type A4 or B2. In
   contrast to the results from exposures to acute heat stress, negligible
   variation was observed in response to a pulsed cold shock despite
   moderate bleaching across all strains. These results support our
   hypothesis that bleaching responses to distinct stressors are
   independent. Our findings emphasize the role of stress regime when
   predicting adaptive responses of symbiotic cnidarians to changing
   climates, because genetic variation may exist for some forms of
   stress-induced bleaching but not others.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Bleaching of reef corals, involving loss of symbiotic algae (=
   zooxanthellae), loss of algal pigments, or both, has been linked to
   temperature stress. In this study the effects of high temperature and
   light on zooxanthellae living in the Caribbean reef corals Montastrea
   annularis, M. cavernosa, Agaricia agaricites, and A. lamarcki were
   studied. Pieces of coral colonies were incubated at ambient seawater
   temperature (26 degrees + 1 degrees), and at 30 degrees, 32 degrees, and
   34 degrees C. Symbiotic algae from M. annularis, a species of coral from
   the forereef that commonly bleaches, showed the following sequence of
   events when exposed to natural light at 32 degrees C: loss of
   photosynthetic potential measured as fluorescence yield, corresponding
   reduction of both oxygen production per zooxanthella and P:R
   (photosynthesis:respiration) ratio, and subsequent reduction in density
   of algae in relation to surface area of the coral. These parameters were
   not signifcantly reduced and no deaths occurred for M. annularis or any
   other coral species maintained at 26 degrees or 30 degrees C. However,
   the sequence of events was condensed to less than 24 h when M. annularis
   was subjected to 34 degrees C seawater, except that there was little if
   any reduction in algal density before tissue-sloughing and death
   occurred between 10 and 24 h. Loss of significant amounts of chlorophyll
   a per alga was not evident for any corals except those maintained at 34
   degrees C longer than 10 h. In contrast, symbiotic algae in M.
   cavernosa, a species that rarely bleaches in nature, showed only slight
   reductions in photosynthesis and fluorescence yield, and no significant
   loss of algal cells or chlorophyll a, when maintained in seawater at 32
   degrees C for 2 days. Thus zooxanthellae in M. cavernosa appeared to be
   less affected by sublethal high-temperature stress. Similar contrasting
   patterns of bleaching were seen in zooxanthellae from the plating coral
   Agaricia lamarcki, which often bleaches during the late summer and fall,
   compared with zooxanthellae from A. agaricites, a coral which bleaches
   less frequently. In addition, M. annularis exposed to sublethal high
   temperatures and ambient light bleached faster than those kept in dimmer
   light, supporting past field observations suggesting that light energy
   is an important component of bleaching in nature. When M. annularis was
   exposed to different wavelengths of natural light at 32 degrees C, the
   fluorescence yield declined more quickly in the presence of higher
   energy UV-A and blue light than with other photosynthetically active
   radiation. Natural levels of UV-B had little effect in this study. These
   data suggest that the patterns of bleaching seen in nature may be at
   least partially explained by different tolerances of the symbiotic algae
   in the corals, and that light plays a significant role in bleaching.},

Volume = {475},
Pages = {11-18},

Abstract = {The effect of climate change, both thermal stress and ocean
   acidification, on coral reefs is of increasing concern with the effects
   on calcification at the organismal level, and changes in the ratio of
   accretion to erosion on larger spatial scales of particular interest.
   But far fewer studies have been done on non-calcifying organisms, such
   as sponges, that have important ecological roles on coral reefs. Here we
   report the results of a combined thermal stress and ocean acidification
   experiment on the ecologically dominant barrel sponge, Xestospongia
   muta, found on coral reefs throughout the Caribbean basin. The results
   show that ocean acidification alone, as well as its interaction with
   elevated seawater temperature, has significant effects on the sponge
   microbiome. Specifically, the significant interactive effects of thermal
   stress and ocean acidification led to a decline in the productivity
   potential of the symbiotic cyanobacteria in these sponges with a
   subsequent impact on nutrient transfer, as carbohydrate, between
   symbiont and host Additionally, while neither environmental stressor
   predictably changed sponge microbiome community composition, ocean
   acidification alone reduced the stability of sponge microbiomes and
   their predicted functions. Future changes in ocean acidification and
   thermal stress predicted by current climate models could negatively
   impact the microbiomes of coral reef organisms and therefore also affect
   their organismal performance and fitness in the future. (C) 2015

Abstract = {Describing, characterizing and interpreting the nearly infinite variety
   of carbonate rocks are conundrums - intricate and difficult problems
   having only conjectural answers - that have occupied geologists for more
   than two centuries. Depositional features including components, rock
   textures, lithofacies, platform types and architecture, all vary in
   space and time, as do the results of diagenetic processes on those
   primary features. Approaches to the study of carbonate rocks have become
   progressively more analytical. One focus has evolved from efforts to
   build reference models for specific Phanerozoic windows to scrutinize
   the effect of climate and long-term oscillations of the ocean-atmosphere
   system in influencing the mineralogy of carbonate components.
   This paper adds to the ongoing lively debates by attempting to
   understand changes in the predominant types of carbonate-producing
   organisms during the Mesozoic-Cenozoic, while striving to minimize the
   uniformitarian bias. Our approach integrates estimates of changes in
   Ca2+ concentration in seawater and atmospheric CO2, with biological
   evolution and ecological requirements of characteristic
   carbonate-producing marine communities. The underlying rationale for our
   approach is the fact that CO2 is basic to both carbonates and organic
   matter, and that photosynthesis is a fundamental biological process
   responsible for both primary production of organic matter and providing
   chemical environments that promote calcification. Gross photosynthesis
   and hypercalcification are dependent largely upon sunlight, while net
   primary production and, e.g., subsequent burial of organic matter
   typically requires sources of new nutrients (N, P and trace elements).
   Our approach plausibly explains the changing character of carbonate
   production as an evolving response to changing environmental conditions
   driven by the geotectonic cycle, while identifying uncertainties that
   deserve further research.
   With metazoan consumer diversity reduced by the end-Permian extinctions,
   excess photosynthesis by phytoplankton and microbial assemblages in
   surface waters, induced by moderately high CO2 and temperature during
   the Early Mesozoic, supported proliferation of non-tissular metazoans
   (e.g., sponges) and heterotrophic bacteria at the sea floor. Metabolic
   activity by those microbes, especially sulfate reduction, resulted in
   abundant biologically-induced geochemical carbonate precipitation on and
   within the sea floor. For example, with the opening of Tethyan seaways
   during the Triassic, massive sponge/microbe boundstones (the benthic
   automicrite factory) formed steep, massive and thick progradational
   slopes and, locally, mud-mounds. As tectonic processes created shallow
   epicontinental seas, photosynthesis drove lime-mud precipitation in the
   illuminated zone of the water column. The resulting neritic lime-mud
   component of the shallow-water carbonate factory became predominant
   during the Jurassic, paralleling the increase in atmospheric pCO(2),
   while the decreasing importance of the benthic automicrite factory
   parallels the diversification of calcifying metazoans, phytoplankton and
   zooplankton.
   With atmospheric pCO(2) declining through the Cretaceous, the potential
   habitats for neritic lime-mud precipitation declined. At the same time,
   peak oceanic Ca2+ concentrations promoted biotically-controlled
   calcification by the skeletal factory. With changes produced by
   extinctions and turnovers at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary,
   adaptations to decreasing Ca2+ and pCO(2), coupled with increasing
   global temperature gradients (i.e., high-latitude and deep-water
   cooling), and strategies that efficiently linked photosynthesis and
   calcification, promoted successive changes of the dominant skeletal
   factory through the Cenozoic: larger benthic foraminifers
   (protist-protist symbiosis) during the Paleogene, red algae during the
   Miocene and modern coral reefs (metazoan-protist symbiosis) since Late
   Miocene. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Estimating the Potential for Adaptation of Corals to Climate Warming},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 18},
Abstract = {The persistence of tropical coral reefs is threatened by rapidly
   increasing climate warming, causing a functional breakdown of the
   obligate symbiosis between corals and their algal photosymbionts
   (Symbiodinium) through a process known as coral bleaching. Yet the
   potential of the coral-algal symbiosis to genetically adapt in an
   evolutionary sense to warming oceans is unknown. Using a quantitative
   genetics approach, we estimated the proportion of the variance in
   thermal tolerance traits that has a genetic basis (i.e. heritability) as
   a proxy for their adaptive potential in the widespread Indo-Pacific
   reef-building coral Acropora millepora. We chose two physiologically
   different populations that associate respectively with one
   thermo-tolerant (Symbiodinium clade D) and one less tolerant symbiont
   type (Symbiodinium C2). In both symbiont types, pulse amplitude
   modulated (PAM) fluorometry and high performance liquid chromatography
   (HPLC) analysis revealed significant heritabilities for traits related
   to both photosynthesis and photoprotective pigment profile. However,
   quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays showed
   a lack of heritability in both coral host populations for their own
   expression of fundamental stress genes. Coral colony growth, contributed
   to by both symbiotic partners, displayed heritability. High
   heritabilities for functional key traits of algal symbionts, along with
   their short clonal generation time and high population sizes allow for
   their rapid thermal adaptation. However, the low overall heritability of
   coral host traits, along with the corals' long generation time, raise
   concern about the timely adaptation of the coral-algal symbiosis in the
   face of continued rapid climate warming.},

Title = {Loss of functional Photosystem II reaction centres in zooxanthellae of
   corals exposed to bleaching conditions:: using fluorescence rise
   kinetics},
Journal = {PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {82},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-72},
Abstract = {Mass coral bleaching is linked to elevated sea surface temperatures, 1 -
   2 degreesC above average, during periods of intense light. These
   conditions induce the expulsion of zooxanthellae from the coral host in
   response to photosynthetic damage in the algal symbionts. The mechanism
   that triggers this release has not been clearly established and to
   further our knowledge of this process, fluorescence rise kinetics have
   been studied for the first time. Corals that were exposed to elevated
   temperature (33 degreesC) and light (280 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1)),
   showed distinct changes in the fast polyphasic induction of
   chlorophyll-a fluorescence, indicating biophysical changes in the
   photochemical processes. The fluorescence rise over the first 2000 ms
   was monitored in three species of corals for up to 8 h, with a PEA
   fluorometer and an imaging-PAM. Pocillopora damicornis showed the least
   impact on photosynthetic apparatus, while Acropora nobilis was the most
   sensitive, with Cyphastrea serailia intermediate between the other two
   species. A. nobilis showed a remarkable capacity for recovery from
   bleaching conditions. For all three species, a steady decline in the
   slope of the initial rise and the height of the J-transient was
   observed, indicating the loss of functional Photosystem II ( PS II)
   centres under elevated-temperature conditions. A significant loss of PS
   II centres was confirmed by a decline in photochemical quenching when
   exposed to bleaching stress. Non-photochemical quenching was identified
   as a significant mechanism for dissipating excess energy as heat under
   the bleaching conditions. Photophosphorylation could explain this
   decline in PS II activity. State transitions, a component of
   non-photochemical quenching, was a probable cause of the high
   non-photochemical quenching during bleaching and this mechanism is
   associated with the phosphorylation-induced dissociation of the light
   harvesting complexes from the PS II reaction centres. This reversible
   process may account for the coral recovery, particularly in A. nobilis.},

Title = {Differential nitric oxide synthesis and host apoptotic events correlate
   with bleaching susceptibility in reef corals},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Pages = {141-153},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Coral bleaching poses a threat to coral reefs worldwide. As a
   consequence of the temperature-induced breakdown in coral-dinoflagellate
   symbiosis, bleaching can have extensive effects on reef communities.
   However, our understanding of bleaching at a cellular level is limited,
   and this is particularly true regarding differential susceptibility
   among coral species. Recent work suggests that bleaching may represent a
   host innate immune-like response to symbiont dysfunction that involves
   synthesis of the signalling compound nitric oxide (NO) and the induction
   of host apoptotic-like cell death. In this study, we examined the
   activity of apoptosis-regulating enzymes alongside oxidised NO
   accumulation (a proxy for NO synthesis) in the reef corals Acropora
   millepora, Montipora digitata, and Pocillopora damicornis during
   experimental thermal stress. P. damicornis was the most sensitive
   species, suffering mortality (tissue sloughing) after 5 days at 33 A
   degrees C but non-lethal bleaching after 9 days at 31.5 A degrees C. A.
   millepora bleached at 33 A degrees C but remained structurally intact,
   while M. digitata showed little evidence of bleaching. P. damicornis and
   A. millepora both exhibited evidence of temperature-induced NO synthesis
   and, after 5 days of heating, levels of oxidised NO in both species were
   fivefold higher than in controls maintained at 28.5 A degrees C. These
   responses preceded bleaching by a number of days and may have occurred
   before symbiont dysfunction (measured as chlorophyll a degradation and
   oxidised NO accumulation). In A. millepora, apparent NO synthesis
   correlated with the induction of host apoptotic-like pathways, while in
   P. damicornis, the upregulation of apoptotic pathways occurred later. No
   evidence of elevated NO production or apoptosis was observed in M.
   digitata at 33 A degrees C and baseline activity of apoptosis-regulating
   enzymes was negligible in this species. These findings provide important
   physiological data in the context of the responses of corals to global
   change and suggest that early events in the host may be important in the
   collapse of the coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis.},

Abstract = {The association between cnidarians and photosynthetic dinoflagellates
   within the genus Symbiodinium is a prevalent relationship in tropical
   and subtropical marine environments. Although the diversity of
   Symbiodinium provides a possible axis for niche diversification,
   increased functional range and resilience to physical stressors such as
   elevated temperature, how such diversity relates to the physiological
   balance between autotrophy and heterotrophy of the host animal remains
   unknown. Here, we experimentally show interspecific and intraspecific
   variability of photosynthetic carbon fixation and subsequent
   translocation by Symbiodinium to the model cnidarian host Aiptasia
   pallida. By using a clonal anemone line harboring different species of
   Symbiodinium, we determined that symbiont identity influences trophic
   plasticity through its density, capacity to fix carbon, quantity of
   translocated carbon and ultimately the host's capacity to ingest and
   digest prey. Symbiont carbon translocation and host prey ingestion were
   positively correlated across symbiont combinations that consisted of
   different isoclonal lines of Symbiodinium minutum, while a combination
   with type D4-5 Symbiodinium displayed lower carbon translocation, and
   prey capture and digestion more similar to Aiptasia lacking symbionts.
   The absence of a shift toward greater heterotrophy when carbon
   translocation is low suggests that the metabolic demand of feeding and
   digestion may overwhelm nutritional stores when photosynthesis is
   reduced, and amends the possible role of animal feeding in resistance to
   or recovery from the effects of climate change in more obligate
   symbioses such as reef-building corals.},

Title = {Evolutionary significance of the microbial assemblages of large benthic
   Foraminifera},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {94},
Number = {3},
Pages = {828-848},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Large benthic Foraminifera (LBF) are major carbonate producers on coral
   reefs, and are hosts to a diverse symbiotic microbial community. During
   warm episodes in the geological past, these reef-building organisms
   expanded their geographical ranges as subtropical and tropical belts
   moved into higher latitudes. During these range-expansion periods, LBF
   were the most prolific carbonate producers on reefs, dominating shallow
   carbonate platforms over reef-building corals. Even though the fossil
   and modern distributions of groups of species that harbour different
   types of symbionts are known, the nature, mechanisms, and factors that
   influence their occurrence remain elusive. Furthermore, the presence of
   a diverse and persistent bacterial community has only recently gained
   attention. We examined recent advances in molecular identification of
   prokaryotic (i.e. bacteria) and eukaryotic (i.e. microalgae) associates,
   and palaeoecology, and place the partnership with bacteria and algae in
   the context of climate change. In critically reviewing the available
   fossil and modern data on symbiosis, we reveal a crucial role of
   microalgae in the response of LBF to ocean warming, and their capacity
   to colonise a variety of habitats, across both latitudes and broad depth
   ranges. Symbiont identity is a key factor enabling LBF to expand their
   geographic ranges when the sea-surface temperature increases. Our
   analyses showed that over the past 66 million years (My), diatom-bearing
   species were dominant in reef environments. The modern record shows that
   these species display a stable, persistent eukaryotic assemblage across
   their geographic distribution range, and are less dependent on symbiotic
   photosynthesis for survival. By contrast, dinoflagellate and
   chlorophytic species, which show a provincial distribution, tend to have
   a more flexible eukaryotic community throughout their range. This group
   is more dependent on their symbionts, and flexibility in their symbiosis
   is likely to be the driving force behind their evolutionary history, as
   they form a monophyletic group originating from a rhodophyte-bearing
   ancestor. The study of bacterial assemblages, while still in its
   infancy, is a promising field of study. Bacterial communities are likely
   to be shaped by the local environment, although a core bacterial
   microbiome is found in species with global distributions. Cryptic
   speciation is also an important factor that must be taken into
   consideration. As global warming intensifies, genetic divergence in
   hosts in addition to the range of flexibility/specificity within
   host-symbiont associations will be important elements in the continued
   evolutionary success of LBF species in a wide range of environments.
   Based on fossil and modern data, we conclude that the microbiome, which
   includes both algal and bacterial partners, is a key factor influencing
   the evolution of LBF. As a result, the microbiome assists LBF in
   colonising a wide range of habitats, and allowed them to become the most
   important calcifiers on shallow platforms worldwide during periods of
   ocean warming in the geologic past. Since LBF are crucial ecosystem
   engineers and prolific carbonate producers, the microbiome is a critical
   component that will play a central role in the responses of LBF to a
   changing ocean, and ultimately in shaping the future of coral reefs.},

Title = {Heat-Induced Photosynthetic Responses of Symbiodiniaceae Revealed by
   Flash-Induced Fluorescence Relaxation Kinetics},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUL 22},
Abstract = {Symbiodiniaceae live in endosymbiosis with corals. In the last few
   decades, mass bleaching events have occurred in the coral reefs, causing
   damage in the ecosystem and the associated species. Global temperature
   increase is affecting the algae, disturbing the whole symbiosis and
   leads to coral bleaching. However, the heat tolerance is strongly
   determined by the species (formerly genetic clades) harbored by the
   coral host. We assessed three different strains of Symbiodiniaceae
   family, i.e., Fugacium kawagutii (CS156), Symbiodinium tridacnidorum
   (2465), and Symbiodinium microadriaticum (2467), which display different
   heat tolerance under heat stress conditions. Flash-induced chlorophyll
   fluorescence relaxation is a useful tool to monitor various components
   of the photosynthetic electron transport chain and the redox reactions
   of plastoquinone pool. We observed the appearance of a wave phenomenon
   in the fluorescence relaxation by heating the strains in combination
   with microaerobic conditions. The characteristics of this fluorescence
   wave were found to be strain-specific and possibly related to the
   transient oxidation and re-reduction of the plastoquinone pool. The
   appearance of the wave phenomenon appears to be related to cyclic
   electron flow as well because it is accompanied with enhanced
   post-illumination chlorophyll fluorescence rise. These results will
   potentially reveal further details of the role of cyclic electron
   transport in Symbiodiniaceae and its relevance in heat stress tolerance.},

Abstract = {The bioeroding sponge Cliona orientalis is photosymbiotic with
   dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium and is pervasive on the Great
   Barrier Reef. We investigated how C. orientalis responded to past and
   future ocean conditions in a simulated community setting. The experiment
   lasted over an Austral summer under four carbon dioxide emission
   scenarios: a pre-industrial scenario (PI), a present-day scenario (PD;
   control), and two future scenarios of combined ocean acidification and
   ocean warming, i.e., B1 (intermediate) and A1FI (extreme). The four
   scenarios also simulated natural variability of carbon dioxide partial
   pressure and temperature in seawater. Responses of C. orientalis
   generally remained similar between the PI and PD treatments. C.
   orientalis under B1 displayed a dramatic increase in lateral tissue
   extension, but bleached and displayed reduced rates of respiration and
   photosynthesis. Some B1 sponge replicates died by the end of the
   experiment. Under A1FI, strong bleaching and subsequent mortality of all
   C. orientalis replicates occurred at an early stage of the experiment.
   Mortality arrested bioerosion by C. orientalis under B1 and A1FI.
   Overall, the absolute amount of calcium carbonate eroded by C.
   orientalis under B1 or A1FI was similar to that under PI or PD at the
   end of the experiment. Although bioerosion rates were raised by
   short-term experimental acidification in previous studies, our findings
   from the photosymbiotic C. orientalis imply that the effects of
   bioerosion on reef carbonate budgets may only be temporary if the
   bioeroders cannot survive long-term in the future oceans.},

Abstract = {Coral bleaching is caused by the loss of symbiont zooxanthellae and/or
   decrease in their pigments. Since the algal symbionts provide the energy
   basis for corals and whole reefs, their loss or impairment of function
   leads to widespread mortality. This phenomenon has been documented
   numerous times in recent years, and has extensively damaged coral reefs
   all over the world. Temperature has been found to be the major cause of
   bleaching, and rising sea temperatures have increased the frequency of
   these catastrophic episodes. To characterize the response of
   zooxanthellae to temperature stress at the molecular level, we used the
   mRNA differential display technique to monitor changes in the abundance
   of specific mRNA species in the cell under different temperature
   conditions. Axenically grown zooxanthellae were exposed to a range of
   temperatures (21.7, 17, 26 degrees C) before extraction of their mRNA.
   Of numerous differentially expressed sequences, seven mRNA species were
   amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced. One of
   those sequences was positively identified as encoding a multifunction
   cell surface aminopeptidase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV, which is active in
   cell matrix adhesion. Our work illustrates the power of the differential
   display technique as a useful tool to study the response of
   zooxanthellae to stressors.},

Abstract = {Increasing sea-surface temperatures and ocean acidification (OA) are
   impacting physiologic processes in a variety of marine organisms. Many
   sea anemones, corals and jellies in the phylum Cnidaria form
   endosymbiotic relationships with Symbiodinium spp. (phylum
   Dinoflagellata) supply the hosts with fixed carbon from photosynthesis.
   Much work has focused on the generally negative effects of rising
   temperature and OA on calcification in Symbiodinium-coral symbioses, but
   has not directly measured symbiont photosynthesis in hospite or fixed
   carbon translocation from symbiont to host. Symbiodinium species or
   types vary in their environmental tolerance and photosynthetic capacity;
   therefore, primary production in symbiotic associations can vary with
   symbiont type. However, symbiont type has not been identified in a large
   portion of Symbiodinium-cnidarian studies. Future climate conditions and
   OA may favor non-calcifying, soft-bodied cnidarians, including
   zoanthids. Here we show that two zoanthid species, Palythoa sp. and
   Zoanthus sp., harboring different symbiont types (C1 and A4), had very
   different responses to increased temperature and increased partial
   pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)), or dissolved CO2, and low pH. Thermal stress
   did not affect carbon fixation or fixed carbon translocation in the
   Zoanthus sp./A4 association, and high pCO(2)/low pH increased carbon
   fixation. In contrast, both thermal stress and high pCO(2)/low pH
   greatly inhibited carbon fixation in the Palythoa sp./C1 association.
   However, the combined treatment of high temperature and high pCO(2)
   increased carbon fixation relative to the treatment of high temperature
   alone. Our observations support the growing body of evidence that
   demonstrates that the response of symbiotic cnidarians to thermal stress
   and OA must be considered on a host-specific and symbiont-specific
   basis. In addition, we show that the effects of increased temperature
   and pCO(2) on photosynthesis may change when these two stressors are
   combined. Understanding how carbon fixation and translocation varies
   among different host-symbiont combinations is critical to predicting
   which Symbiodinium associations may persist in warm, acidified oceans.},

Abstract = {Tropical reef corals are well known for their sensitivity to rising
   temperature, yet surprisingly little is known of the mechanisms through
   which temperature acts on intact coral colonies. One such mechanism
   recently has been suggested by the association between the growth of
   juvenile corals and seawater temperature in the Caribbean, which
   suggests that temperature causes a transition between isometric and
   allometric growth scaling in warmer versus cooler years, respectively
   (Edmunds in Proc R Soc B 273:2275-2281, 2006). Here, this correlative
   association is tested experimentally for a cause-and-effect
   relationship. During April and May 2006, juvenile colonies (8-35 mm
   diameter) of massive Porites spp. from Moorea, French Polynesia, were
   incubated at warm (27.8 degrees C) and cool (25.7 degrees C)
   temperatures for 15 days, and their response assessed through the
   scaling of growth (change in weight) with colony size. The results
   reveal that the scaling of colony-specific growth (mg colony(-1)
   day(-1)) was unaffected by temperature, although growth absolutely was
   greater at the cool compared to the warm temperature, regardless of
   colony size. This outcome was caused by contrasting scaling
   relationships for area-specific growth (mg cm(-2) day(-1)) that were
   negatively allometric under warm conditions, but independent of size
   under cool conditions. In April 2007, a 22 days field experiment
   confirmed that the scaling of area-specific growth in juvenile Porites
   spp. is negatively allometric at a warm temperature of 29.5 degrees C.
   Based on strong allometry for tissue thickness, biomass, and
   Symbiodinium density in freshly collected Porites spp., it is
   hypothesized that the temperature-dependency of growth scaling in these
   small corals is mediated by the interaction of temperature with biomass.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {Recent research efforts have demonstrated increased bioerosion rates
   under experimentally elevated partial pressures of seawater carbon
   dioxide (pCO(2)) with or without increased temperatures, which may lead
   to net erosion on coral reefs in the future. However, this conclusion
   clearly depends on the ability of the investigated bioeroding organisms
   to survive and grow in the warmer and more acidic future environments,
   which remains unexplored. The excavating sponge Cliona orientalis
   Thiele, is a widely distributed bioeroding organism and symbiotic with
   dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium. Using C. orientalis, an
   energy budget model was developed to calculate amounts of carbon
   directed into metabolic maintenance and growth. This model was tested
   under a range of CO2 emission scenarios (temperature+pCO(2)) appropriate
   to an Austral early summer. Under a pre-industrial scenario, present day
   (control) scenario, or B1 future scenario (associated with reducing the
   rate of CO2 emissions over the next few decades), C. orientalis
   maintained a positive energy budget, where metabolic demand was likely
   satisfied by autotrophic carbon provided by Symbiodinium and
   heterotrophic carbon via filter-feeding, suggesting sustainability.
   Under B1, C. orientalis likely benefited by a greater supply of
   photosynthetic products from its symbionts, which increased by up to
   56\% per unit area, and displayed an improved condition with up to 52\%
   increased surplus carbon available for growth. Under an A1FI future
   scenario (associated with business-as-usual' CO2 emissions) bleached C.
   orientalis experienced the highest metabolic demand, but carbon acquired
   was insufficient to maintain the sponge, as indicated by a negative
   energy budget. These metabolic considerations suggest that previous
   observations of increased bioerosion under A1FI by C. orientalis may not
   last through the height of future A1FI summers, and survival of
   individual sponges may be dependent on the energy reserves (biomass)
   they have accumulated through the rest of the year.},

Abstract = {The effects of various environmental parameters on zooxanthellae
   isolated from the sea anemone Condylactis gigantea were studied under
   controlled conditions in the laboratory. We determined that the
   zooxanthellae, identified as Symbiodinium microadriaticum (by Trench.
   B.) belong to clade B. These algae were exposed to a range of
   temperatures (17, 21.7, 26 degrees C), light intensities (25, 30, 45, 85
   mu mol q m(-2) s(-1)) and nutrient regimes. While growth rate was
   relatively independent of treatment, respiration increased significantly
   with temperature. Both light and temperature did have a significant
   effect on photosynthetic parameters.
   The cultured zooxanthellae responded to the environment in ways similar
   to those of freshly isolated ones, and survived under a wide range of
   temperatures (17, 21.7, 26 degrees C).
   In general, clade B seems to be flexible and well adapted to the
   temperature range encountered in seawater throughout its wide global
   distribution. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Nutritional interactions between corals and symbiotic dinoflagellate
   algae lie at the heart of the structural foundation of coral reefs.
   Whilst the genetic diversity of Symbiodinium has attracted particular
   interest because of its contribution to the sensitivity of corals to
   environmental changes and bleaching (i.e. disruption of
   coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis), very little is known about the in
   hospite metabolic capabilities of different Symbiodinium types. Using a
   combination of stable isotopic labelling and nanoscale secondary ion
   mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS), we investigated the ability of the intact
   symbiosis between the reef-building coral Isopora palifera, and
   SymbiodiniumC or D types, to assimilate dissolved inorganic carbon (via
   photosynthesis) and nitrogen (as ammonium). Our results indicate that
   Symbiodinium types from two clades naturally associated with I.palifera
   possess different metabolic capabilities. The SymbiodiniumC type fixed
   and passed significantly more carbon and nitrogen to its coral host than
   the D type. This study provides further insights into the metabolic
   plasticity among different Symbiodinium types in hospite and strengthens
   the evidence that the more temperature-tolerant SymbiodiniumD type may
   be less metabolically beneficial for its coral host under non-stressful
   conditions.},

Title = {The Response of the Mediterranean Gorgonian <i>Eunicella</i>
   <i>singularis</i> to Thermal Stress Is Independent of Its Nutritional
   Regime},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 8},
Abstract = {Over the last few decades, sessile benthic organisms from the
   Mediterranean Sea have suffered from the global warming of the world's
   oceans, and several mass mortality events were observed during warm
   summers. It has been hypothesized that mortality could have been due to
   a nutrient (food) shortage following the stratification of the water
   column. However, the symbiotic gorgonian Eunicella singularis has also
   presented a locally exceptional mortality, despite its autotrophic
   capacities through the photosynthesis of its dinoflagellate symbionts.
   Thus, this study has experimentally investigated the response of E.
   singularis to a thermal stress (temperature increase from 18 to 26
   degrees C), with colonies maintained more than 2 months under four
   nutritional diets: autotrophy only (AO), autotrophy and inorganic
   nitrogen addition (AN), autotrophy and heterotrophy (AH), heterotrophy
   only (HO). At 18 degrees C, and contrary to many other anthozoans,
   supplementation of autotrophy with either inorganic nitrogen or food
   (heterotrophy) had no effect on the rates of respiration,
   photosynthesis, as well as in the chlorophyll, lipid and protein
   content. In the dark, heterotrophy maintained the gorgonian's
   metabolism, except a bleaching (loss of pigments), which did not affect
   the rates of photosynthesis. At 24 degrees C, rates of respiration, and
   photosynthesis significantly decreased in all treatments. At 26 degrees
   C, in addition to a decrease in the lipid content of all treatments, a
   bleaching was observed after 1 week in the AO treatment, while the AH
   and AN treatments resisted three weeks before bleaching. These last
   results suggest that, temperatures above 24 degrees C impair the
   energetic reserves of this species and might explain the mortality
   events in the Mediterranean.},

Title = {Light-mediated <SUP>15</SUP>N fractionation in Caribbean gorgonian
   octocorals: implications for pollution monitoring},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {30},
Number = {3},
Pages = {709-717},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The stable nitrogen isotope ratio (delta N-15) of coral tissue is a
   useful recorder of anthropogenic pollution in tropical marine
   ecosystems. However, little is known of the natural environmentally
   induced fractionations that affect our interpretation of coral delta
   N-15 values. In symbiotic scleractinians, light affects metabolic
   fractionation of N during photosynthesis, which may confound the
   identification of N pollution between sites of varied depth or
   turbidity. Given the superiority of octocorals for delta N-15 studies,
   our goal was to quantify the effect of light on gorgonian delta N-15 in
   the context of monitoring N pollution sources. Using field collections,
   we show that delta N-15 declined by 1.4aEuro degrees over 20 m depth in
   two species of gorgonians, the common sea fan, Gorgonia ventalina, and
   the slimy sea plume, Pseudopterogorgia americana. An 8-week laboratory
   experiment with P. americana showed that light, not temperature causes
   this variation, whereby the lowest fractionation of the N source was
   observed in the highest light treatment. Finally, we used a yearlong
   reciprocal depth transplant experiment to quantify the time frame over
   which delta N-15 changes in G. ventalina as a function of light regime.
   Over the year, delta N-15 was unchanged and increased slightly in the
   deep control colonies and shallow colonies transplanted to the deep
   site, respectively. Within 6 months, colonies transplanted from deep to
   shallow became enriched by 0.8aEuro degrees, mirroring the enrichment
   observed in the shallow controls, which was likely due to the combined
   effect of an increase in the source delta N-15 and reduced
   fractionation. We conclude that light affects gorgonian delta N-15
   fractionation and should be considered in sampling designs for N
   pollution monitoring. However, these fractionations are small relative
   to differences observed between natural and anthropogenic N sources.},

Title = {Scleractinian corals with photoprotective host pigments are
   hypersensitive to thermal bleaching},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {272},
Pages = {99-116},
Abstract = {Recent episodes of mass coral bleaching, the loss of symbiotic
   dinoflagellates or photosynthetic pigment from hermatypic corals, have
   been triggered by elevated sea temperatures. Photosynthetic irradiance
   is an important secondary factor. Host based pigments (pocilloporins or
   Green Fluorescent Protein homologues) have been proposed to reduce the
   impact of elevated temperature by shading the dinoflagellate symbionts
   of corals, thereby reducing light stress. This study investigates this
   phenomenon in the reef-building coral Acropora aspera from Heron Island
   Research Station (Great Barrier Reef, Australia), which occurs as 3
   distinct colour morphs. Experimental data showed that the host pigments
   are photoprotective at normal temperatures or <32degreesC; however, the
   loss of symbionts and reduction in the quantum yield of photosynthesis
   (dark adapted F-v/F-m) observed after exposure to elevated temperature
   was most severe in the heavily pigmented blue morph, eventually
   resulting in death of most experimental colonies. The results suggest
   that the protection offered by pocilloporins and other GFP-homologues is
   reduced by thermal stress, potentially leaving the shade-acclimated
   symbionts of heavily pigmented corals exposed to high light levels.
   Mature host pigments are thermally stable, but they are potentially
   vulnerable to heat during mRNA and protein synthesis and/or maturation,
   It is clear, however, that the broad assumption that host pigmented
   corals are less vulnerable to thermal stress is incorrect.},

Abstract = {Photo-physiological responses of one massive, Platygyra ryukyuensis, and
   three branching corals, Porites cylindrica, Montipora digitata and
   Seriatopora caliendrum, with different bleaching susceptibilities,
   exposed to thermal stress over a period of 30 h and thereafter their
   bleaching and mortality over a period of four months were investigated.
   The changes in maximum quantum yield (F-v/F-m) and maximum electron
   transport rate (ETRmax) revealed three patterns during the 30 h
   treatment at 32degreesC under 450 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1). P.
   ryukyuensis showed small but significant changes in F-v/F-m without
   changes in ETRmax and S. caliendrum showed a drastic decrease in both
   parameters, while M. digitata and P. cylindrica showed similar trend in
   decrease of the F-v/F-m values only. After 30 h exposure to thermal
   stress, the total chlorophyll content decreased significantly only in S.
   caliendrum and zooxanthellae density decreased significantly in all
   tested coral species except of P. ryukyuensis. Mortality data over four
   months after the thermal stress treatment showed three trends. P.
   ryukytiensis and S. caliendrum showed no mortality and 100\% mortality,
   respectively. Mortality in M. digitata was greater than that in P.
   cylindrica.
   These results suggest that in P. ryukyuensis (resistant coral) both the
   algae and the host are strong while in S. caliendrum (susceptible coral)
   both partners are weak. Although intermediate coral species, M. digitata
   and P. cylindrica showed the same level of F-v/F-m reductions and
   percentage loss of zooxanthellae, the host component seemed to be
   stronger in P. cylindrica than in M. digitata as revealed by their
   different mortalities. Thus, we conclude that variations in bleaching
   susceptibility and mortality among scleractinian corals are a result of
   the combined physiological responses of both partners of the symbiotic
   system to thermal stress.},

Title = {FACTORS CONTROLLING HOLOCENE REEF GROWTH - AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH},
Journal = {FACIES},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {32},
Pages = {145-188},
Abstract = {This interim report deals with investigations on key factors controlling
   reef growth by zoophysiologists, ecologists, paleontologists and
   geologists. The different levels of emphasis are the coral animal and
   the reef community. The main study area is the Red Sea which reaches
   over 20 degrees latitude up to the northernmost margin of the global
   coral reef belt. Supplementary results on microborer ecology are
   provided from the Bahamas.
   The desert enclosed Red Sea, not influenced by land runoff and only
   minimally by anthropogenic (urban and touristic) nutrient inputs, is
   predestined for a study on the principal influence of light on
   calcification within bathymetrical and latitudinal gradients. Hence, on
   the level of the zooxanthellate scleractinian animal phototrophic and
   heterotrophic energy supply and its bearing on calcification are being
   measured in different coral species - in particular in Porites sp., one
   of the most important reef builders.
   The growth of 15 zooxanthellate scleractinians in the Gulf of Aqaba
   correlates with the annual light cycle. This correlation is observable
   down to 40 m depth. Other growth promoting factors seem to have less
   influence on coral extension. The availability of organically enriched
   sediments in shallow water probably yields nutritional value, in
   particular for filter feeding species, thus restricting their
   distribution to those areas. Zooxanthellae, when isolated from Mycedium
   elephantotus, are different in their dependence on depth in maximum
   rates of photosynthesis and photosynthetic efficiency ( -slope).
   Increasing concentrations of pigments as a function of depth could be
   determined. Maximum rates of photosynthesis of zooxanthellae in vivo,
   collected at corresponding depth, have been 4 times higher. Structural
   and physiological adaptations improving heterotrophic and phototrophic
   energy intake are highlighted.
   Porites sp. was the subject of annual growth studies at locations
   extending from Aqaba in the North over the northern and southern
   Egyptian coast and islands, Sanganeb Atoll and Wingate reef offshore
   Sudan to the Gulf of Tadjoura in the Gulf of Aden (Djibouti). Mean
   growth rates in the shallow water zone increase with decreasing latitude
   and are highest at the southernmost studied reefs in the Gulf of
   Tadjoura. However, the observed latitudinal growth reduction is
   restricted to the upper ca. 15 m of the water column. The upper limit of
   growth potential decreases with depth parallel to the decrease of light
   availability. Highest growth rates are recorded in shallow depth
   (10-12.9 mm yr(-1)). This zone reaches at Aqaba (29 degrees 30'N) to a
   depth of ca. 10 m. At the southern Egyptian reefs (24 degrees 30'N) this
   zone extends to ca. 15 m water depth. This effect is probably a result
   of the stronger reduction of winter light levels and water temperature
   in the northern regions. Compared to other oceans the decrease of growth
   with increasing latitude of Red Sea Porites corals is far less, and
   growth rates at Aqaba are the highest observed at these latitudes.
   On the level of the community of reef inhabitants four principal topics
   are addressed:
   The first one is the dynamics of the proportions of hermatypic and
   ahermatypic organisms and open space. The occurrence of stony and soft
   corals and the sharing of empty space in different reef sections at
   Aqaba and on Sanganeb Atoll were quantified. Soft corals, mainly
   Sinularia- and xeniid species, occupy decreasing shares with depth.
   Among the Xenia species a bathymetrical zonation pattern was detected.
   The next issue is the growth impeding role of soft corals and gastropod
   parasites and predators on scleractinians. Experimental and field
   observations showed xeniid soft corals to be opportunistic i.e.
   occupying rapidly open space rather than to attacking and outcompeting
   stony corals. An increasingly specialized behaviour was detected among
   corallivorous gastropods of the family Corallophilidae to exploit their
   coral hosts. Whereas these snails are more or less sessile and depend
   for a long time on the surrounding host polyps the mobile Drupella
   cornus (Thaididae) forms feeding aggregations which denude mainly
   branching corals on shallow reef parts.
   Furthermore, the role counteracting reef growth of macro- and
   microbioeroders is investigated. Diadema setosum is a major destructive
   agent on reefs at Aqaba (not in the central Red Sea). The grazing sea
   urchins do not only keep potential colonization area free but also erode
   carbonate material (e. g. 1468 g/m(2)/year, 10 m depth). Demographic and
   bathymetric patterns in the sea urchin population are analyzed including
   their bearing on bioerosion of the reef. Investigations on microboring
   organisms in carbonate material have started in the Red Sea; initial
   results, however, are only available from similar studies near Lee
   Stocking island, Bahamas.
   Three major environments have been identified based on the distribution
   of the different microborers. These are
   1) the intertidal environment dominated by boring cyanobacteria,
   2) reef sites from 2 to 30 m water depth dominated by a diverse
   assemblage of boring cyanobacteria and chlorophytes, and
   3) the deep reef slope from 100 to 300 m dominated by boring green algae
   and heterotrophs.
   The boring chlorophyte genus Phaeophila appears rapidly and dominates at
   sites from 2 to 30 m, but it leaves vacated borings and is replaced by
   Ostreobium quekettii after 1 year. Different substrate types show very
   different rates of colonization by microborers. The greatest excavation
   rates (100 g /m(2)/3 months) occur in fine-grained limestone, while the
   slowest rates (0.5 g/m(2)/3 months) occur in calcite crystals. Molluscan
   shell material shows intermediate rates of excavation. Light conditions
   appear very important in determining the growth rate and distribution of
   different microborers between the sites, however, the interaction of
   light with other factors, such as substrate, time period of exposure,
   and water quality conditions may be involved.},

Title = {Thermal performance with depth: Comparison of a mesophotic scleractinian
   and an antipatharian species subjected to internal waves in Mo'orea,
   French Polynesia},
Journal = {MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {184},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Local thermal environment has a strong influence on the physiology of
   marine ectotherms. This is particularly relevant for tropical organisms
   living close to their thermal optimum, well exemplified by the
   increasing fre-quency of bleaching occurrence in shallow-water corals.
   Mesophotic Coral Ecosystems (MCEs) were suggested as potential oases,
   especially when they are submitted to internal waves inducing short-term
   cooling events. Indeed, probability of bleaching occurrence in
   scleractinians was reported to decrease with depth in Mo'orea as
   tem-perature variability increases. However, ecophysiological data are
   currently lacking to understand the cause of lower
   susceptibility/increased plasticity of deeper corals. A growing interest
   has been devoted the last decade to MCEs, but our understanding of the
   physiological performance of benthic organisms living in this
   environment remains relatively unexplored. To tackle that question, we
   first compared the metabolic responses (dark respi-ration, net
   photosynthesis and photosynthetic efficiency) of the depth-generalist
   scleractinian Pachyseris speciosa from two heterogeneous thermal
   environment (25 and 85 m depths) to acute heat stress to determine if
   the local thermal environment could predict coral response to warming.
   Then, we tested the thermal performance of two sympatric species (the
   scleractinian P. speciosa and the antipatharian Stichopathes sp.) to
   determine if there are inter-species differences in performances in
   species experiencing identical levels of temperature variability, at
   mesophotic depths (85 m). Results revealed broader thermal performances
   in the mesophotic P. speciosa compared to mid-depth ones, and
   constrained performances in the mesophotic antipatharian compared to the
   scleractinian species. We hypothesize that the high fluctuations in
   temperature due to internal waves in deeper areas contribute to the
   broader thermal performances of mesophotic P. speciosa. However, the
   constrained performances of the mesophotic antipatharian compared to P.
   speciosa suggests that other processes than the symbiosis with
   zooxanthellae also influence thermal performances of these mesophotic
   organisms. Our results supported that Stichopathes sp. lives close to
   its thermal optimum, suggesting a (relatively) cold thermal specialist
   strategy. In this context, composition of MCEs in the future is unlikely
   to shift to antipatharian-dominated landscape and will remain
   coral-dominated landscape.},

Abstract = {Chloroplasts (chlorophyll-containing plastids) and other plastids are
   found in all plants and many animals. They are crucial to the survival
   of plants and most of the animals that harbour them. An example of a
   non-photosynthesizing plastid in animals is the apicoplast in the
   malaria-causing Plasmodium species, which is required for survival of
   the parasite. Many animals (such as sea slugs, sponges, reef corals, and
   clams) consume prey containing chloroplasts, or feed on algae. Some of
   these incorporate the chloroplasts from their food, or whole algal
   cells, into their own cells. Other species from these groups place algal
   cells between their own cells. Reef-building corals often lose their
   intracellular algae as a result of environmental changes, resulting in
   coral bleaching and death. The sensitivity of the chloroplast internal
   membranes to temperature stress is one of the reasons for coral death.
   Chloroplasts can also be a causal factor in the processes leading to
   whole-plant death, as the knockout of a gene encoding a chloroplast
   protein delayed the yellowing that proceeds death in tobacco plants. It
   is concluded that chloroplasts and other plastids are essential to
   individual survival in many species, including animals, and that they
   also play a role in triggering death in some plant and animal species.

   degrees C/390 ppm, and 31 degrees C/1000 ppm where each of these
   treatments had fed and unfed components). The goal was to determine how
   the same species of coral from different locations would respond to
   projected climate change scenarios. Wefound that growth (measured as
   changes in buoyant weight) was highly correlated to source location
   (i.e., whether the corals came from Emerald Reef or Truman Harbor) and
   not to parent colony, and growth, symbiont density, chlorophyll a
   content, and lipid content were highly correlated to feeding regime.
   These findings show that within a single reef tract, (i.e. the Florida
   Reef Tract), source location and food availability matter for the
   physiological outcome of a coral's stress response, and suggest that an
   explicit consideration of these effects may be important for management
   activities such as coral restoration, transplantation, and MPA
   placement. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Two naturally occurring colonies of Millepora alcicornis were monitored
   during 1997 and 1998, both years in which this species bleached in the
   Mexican Caribbean. One colony (HL) was naturally exposed to a high light
   environment and another nearby colony (LL) was exposed to 5.9 times
   lower light levels due to shadowing by a pier. For 10 days in August
   1997, seawater temperatures in the surrounding reef lagoon rose up to
   1.5degreesC above the 6-year August average. The HL colony bleached to
   white during this period, whereas, the LL colony remained dark-brown
   colored. The HL colony recovered its normal dark-brown coloration
   (reversible bleaching) within several weeks, during which time the
   seawater temperatures returned to average. The following year, for 10
   days, seawater temperatures rose up to 3degreesC above the 7-year August
   average and both colonies bleached to white and neither colony recovered
   (irreversible bleaching). Both colonies were rapidly overgrown by algae
   and hydroids and, as of June 2003, no recovery has taken place. Prior to
   the 1997 bleaching, experiments using solar radiation showed that the
   quantum yield of photosystem II charge separation of branches from HL
   and LL colonies were affected for several hours by exposure to
   ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 280 to 400 nm), but recovered by the same
   evening, suggesting that UVR does not have long-term effects on
   photochemistry in M. alcicornis. In situ effective quantum yield of
   photosystem II charge separation (DeltaF/Fm') measurements before the
   1998 bleaching event indicate that both colonies were healthy in terms
   of the physiological status of their endosymbionts. During and after the
   1998 bleaching event, both colonies showed a reduction in DeltaF/Fm' and
   consequently an increase in excitation pressure on photosystem II. The
   data suggest that temperature is not the only factor that causes
   bleaching and that solar radiation may play an important role in coral
   bleaching.},

Title = {The use of <i>invivo</i> microscopy to image the cnidarian stress
   response in three octocoral species},
Journal = {INVERTEBRATE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {136},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Energy-converting symbionts and organelles may be central to the
   cnidarian stress response. Stress may damage photochemistry in the
   endosymbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium spp., leaving photosystems I
   and II relatively reduced and increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS).
   Alternatively, ROS may emanate from mitochondria of either the host or
   the symbiont, or both. These sources of ROS can be distinguished by
   using microscopy to examine the effects of light on stressed cnidarians
   incubated in the dark with a fluorescent, ROS-detecting probe.
   Experiments were carried out with three species of alcyonacean
   octocoral, Phenganax parrini, Sarcothelia sp., and Sympodium sp. After
   incubation of colonies for 1h at elevated temperature, imaging and
   illumination (excitation 450-490nm, emission 515-565nm) were begun
   simultaneously. Formation of ROS largely corresponded to the onset of
   illumination. On the other hand, chlorophyll fluorescence (excitation
   530-580nm, emission 620-690nm) did not conform to this pattern. This
   difference is consistent with the expected rates of reaction.
   Remarkably, treatment with the inhibitor
   3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) resulted in dramatically
   higher levels of light-induced ROS. Chlorophyll fluorescence was higher
   in the DCMU treatment but not significantly so. By controlling for
   variation between individual symbionts, however, DCMU produced
   significantly greater levels of chlorophyll fluorescence, indicating the
   expected greater reduction of photosystem II. A brief exposure to light
   and thermal stress produced a similar effect in all three species. In
   addition to ROS being initiated by light, these results indicate that:
   (1) a brief period of stress shifts photosystem redox state toward
   reduction, (2) photosystem II can donate electrons to oxygen when
   blocked with DCMU, and (3) chlorophyll fluorescence is highly variable
   among individuals of Symbiodinium. Imaging of individual symbionts in
   hospite thus provides a powerful method for understanding the initial
   steps of the cnidarian stress response.},

Title = {Improper Diving Behavior Affects Physiological Responses of <i>Acropora
   hyacinthus</i> and <i>Porites cylindrica</i>},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 8},
Abstract = {Human activities beyond ecosystem capacity have resulted in serious
   effects on corals worldwide. Nowadays, many studies have focused on the
   influence of diving activities on coral communities, while the knowledge
   of physiological changes under corresponding environmental stresses
   remains largely undetermined. In the study, we aimed to investigate the
   physiological effects of touching, ammonia nitrogen enrichment (5 mu
   mol.L-1), and sediment cover (particle size of less than 0.3 mm), which
   simulated improper self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA)
   diving behaviors, on Acropora hyacinthus and Porites cylindrica in
   Wuzhizhou Island, the South China Sea. For A. hyacinthus, continuous
   touching caused the tentacles to shrink and secrete mucus, which
   consumed energy and dissolved oxygen. The skeletal growth rate was
   decreased by 72\% compared with the control group. There was a rapid
   decline of Fv/Fm and alpha under the dual impacts of high ammonia
   nitrogen and touching, while the Chl a concentration and tissue biomass
   were decreased by 36 and 28\% compared with touching alone,
   respectively. High ammonia nitrogen and touching increased the
   concentrations of lipid and protein. Nevertheless, zooxanthellae density
   was increased by 23\% to relieve the effects of a lower concentration of
   Chl a in a high nutrient environment. Constant touching and sediment
   cover in diving areas with elevated ammonia content affected the
   photosynthesis and respiration of corals, and a significant decrease was
   observed for lipid, zooxanthellae density, and Chl a concentration.
   Coral bleaching occurred on day 7. For P. cylindrica, the decreasing
   magnitude of Fv/Fm and alpha under different stresses in the subsequent
   phase was less compared with A. hyacinthus. The contents of carbohydrate
   and protein under continuous touching were decreased by 7 and 15\%
   compared with the control group, respectively, causing negative growth.
   Under the dual influences of high ammonia nitrogen and continuous
   touching, all energy reserves were significantly lower. Repeated
   touching and sediment cover in diving areas containing high ammonia
   content increased the concentrations of lipid and protein compared with
   the touching and high nutrient treatment group likely because that
   Porites associated with C15 zooxanthella increased heterotrophic feeding
   to compensate for restricted symbiodiniaceae photosynthesis.
   Additionally, P. cylindrica produced mucus to aid the removal of
   sediment, so that corals didn't obviously bleach during the experiment.
   Collectively, P. cylindrica was more resistant to diving activities than
   A. hyacinthus which only relies on photoautotrophy. To ensure the
   sustainable development of coral reef dive tourism, it is necessary to
   strengthen the supervision of diving behaviors, rotate the diving areas,
   and conduct regular assessments on the coral status.},

Journal = {MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Pulse-amplitude-modulation chlorophyll fluorometry was used to examine
   changes in dark-adapted F-v/F-m of endosymbiotic dinoflagellate
   microalgae within the tissues of the temperate coral Plesiastrea
   versipora exposed to elevated seawater temperature. The F-v/F-m was
   markedly reduced following exposure of corals to 28 degrees C for 48 h.
   When corals were returned to ambient (24 degrees C) conditions, F-v/F-m
   increased in an initial rapid and then secondary slower phase. Tissue
   discolouration (coral bleaching), caused by a significant decrease in
   the density of algae, was observed during the first 2-3 days of the
   recovery period. After 14 days, F-v/F-m was still significantly lower
   than in control corals. The recovery of F-v/F-m is discussed in terms of
   repair processes within the symbiotic algae, division of healthy algae
   and also the selective removal of photo-damaged dinoflagellates. Under
   field conditions, bleached corals sampled at Heron Island Reef during a
   bleaching event had significantly lower F-v/F-m than non-bleached
   colonies; four months after the bleaching event, there were no
   differences in F-v/F-m or algal density in corals marked as having
   bleached or having shown no signs of colour loss. The results of this
   laboratory and field study are consistent with the hypothesis that an
   impairment of photosynthesis occurs during heat-stress, and is the
   underlying cause of coral bleaching.},

Abstract = {Coral larvae are selective with regards to the surfaces upon which they
   settle, but little is known about the outcome of these choices. In this
   study, we explored the implications for juvenile scleractinians (<40-mm
   diameter) of growing on igneous versus carbonate rock on the shallow
   reefs (5-m depth) of St. John, US Virgin Islands. Surveys revealed that
   juvenile corals occurred at densities of 16 colonies m(-2) and were
   distributed on igneous and carbonate rocks in proportion to the
   abundance of these surfaces, suggesting that larvae do not discriminate
   between rock types at settlement. Repeated surveys demonstrated that all
   juvenile corals (i.e., pooled among taxa) grew 41\% slower on igneous
   versus carbonate rock between January and August, but not between August
   and January when the growth was statistically indistinguishable between
   rock types. Although the growth of the most common juvenile coral,
   Porites astreoides, was similar on both substrata, the photophysiology
   of this species was affected by the type of rock. The maximum relative
   electron transfer rate (rETR, a proxy for photosynthesis) of P.
   astreoides was down-regulated 30\% on igneous compared to carbonate
   rock. Phylogenetic analyses of the Symbiodinium community sequence
   profiles within P. astreoides revealed significant differences between
   substrata, with a greater diversity of co-occurring ITS-2 sequences in
   corals growing on carbonate compared to igneous rock. While
   substratum-dependent patterns in the characteristics of juvenile corals
   suggested there is selective value to the settlement choices made by
   larvae, these trends did not translate into differences in survival, at
   least over the time scale investigated. It remains uncertain what
   features of the rocks affected coral performance, but differences in the
   temperature of the rock may be an important feature during the warmest
   period of the year. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Ecosystem resilience to climate anomalies is related to the
   physiological plasticity of organisms. To characterize the physiological
   response of some common Mediterranean gorgonians to fluctuations in
   temperature, four species (Paramuricea clavata, Eunicella singularis,
   Eunicella cavolinii and Corallium rubrum) were maintained in aquaria, in
   which the temperature was increased every ten days with increments of
   2-3 degrees C, starting at 14 degrees C, ending at 25 degrees C. Oxygen
   consumption, number of open/closed polyps and percentage of necrotic
   tissue were monitored. All species showed similar activity patterns with
   increasing temperature. P. clavata and E. singularis showed the highest
   respiration rate at 18 degrees C, E. cavolinii and C rubrum at 20
   degrees C. Above these temperatures, both oxygen consumption and polyp
   reactivity decreased in all species. The present data confirm a
   reduction of the metabolic activity in Mediterranean gorgonians during
   periods of high temperature. At temperatures above 18 degrees C, the
   percentage of open polyps (considered as a parameter to evaluate polyps
   reactivity) decreased, thus mirroring the trend of oxygen consumption.
   The average values of Q(10) indicated that gorgonians have a definite
   temperature limit over which the metabolism (oxygen consumption) stop to
   follow the temperature increase. After three days at 25 degrees C,
   metabolic activity in E. cavolinii, C. rubrum and P. clavata further
   decreased and the first signs of necrosis were observed. At this
   temperature, activity remained unchanged in E. singularis. This species
   seems to more resistant to thermal stress. The symbiotic zooxanthellae
   present in this species are likely to provide an alternative source of
   energy when polyps reduce their feeding activity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Biological mechanisms supporting adaptation to ocean acidification in
   coastal ecosystems},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {152},
Pages = {A1-A8},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {The direct influence of anthropogenic CO2 might play a limited role in
   pH regulation in coastal ecosystems as pH regulation in these areas can
   be complex. They experience large variability across a broad range of
   spatial and temporal scales, with complex external and internal drivers.
   Organisms influence pH at a patch scale, where community metabolic
   effects and hydrodynamic processes interact to produce broad ranges in
   pH, (similar to 0.3-0.5 pH units) over daily cycles and spatial scales
   (mm to m) particularly in shallow vegetated habitats and coral reefs
   where both respiration and photosynthetic activity are intense.
   Biological interactions at the ecosystem scale, linked to patchiness in
   habitat landscapes and seasonal changes in metabolic processes and
   temperature lead to changes of about 0.3-0.5 pH units throughout a year.
   Furthermore, on the scale of individual organisms, small-scale processes
   including changes at the Diffusive Boundary Layer (DBL), interactions
   with symbionts, and changes to the specific calcification environment,
   induce additional changes in excess of 0.5 pH units.
   In these highly variable pH environments calcifying organisms have
   developed the capacity to alter the pH of their calcifying environment,
   or specifically within critical tissues where calcification occurs, thus
   achieving a homeostasis. This capacity to control the conditions for
   calcification at the organism scale may therefore buffer the full
   impacts of ocean acidification on an organism scale, although this might
   be at a cost to the individual. Furthermore, in some areas, calcifiers
   may potentially benefit from changes to ambient seawater pH, where
   photosynthetic organisms drawdown CO2. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Sensitivity of calcification to thermal history differs between sexes in
   the gonochoric reef-building corals<i>Dichocoenia
   stokesi</i>and<i>Dendrogyra cylindrus</i>},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {167},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUN 22},
Abstract = {Calcification and sexual reproduction in corals are energy consuming
   metabolic processes. In symbiotic corals, calcification is a daily
   process and depends on the ability of the coral colony to produce
   energy, through the photosynthesis of symbiotic algae or heterotrophy,
   while sexual reproduction in several broadcast spawning species is
   carried out once a year and depends on the amount of energy stored as
   lipids within the coral tissue. Calcification and reproduction are
   influenced by environmental parameters, such as light irradiance and sea
   surface temperature (SST). Reproduction may be inhibited by thermal
   stress and coral calcification rate decreases as SST increases above a
   certain threshold. However, it is unknown if there is a sex-related
   response of calcification rate to thermal history. Here, we test the
   differential sensitivities of calcification rates to thermal history by
   examining its recent historical variation in females and males of two
   common Caribbean gonochoric reef-building coral species,Dichocoenia
   stokesiandDendrogyra cylindrus. Colony sex was determined by
   histological techniques, and sclerochronology was measured using
   densitometry from digitized X-ray images. Calcification rates were
   higher in male colonies than in females of both species, as previously
   reported in other gonochoric corals, and can be explained in terms of
   disparity in energy availability for calcification among sexes due to
   the differential energetic costs of eggs and sperm. Calcification rates
   of both species were negatively related to SST when data of both sexes
   were pooled together. When data were analyzed separately by sex, only
   female colonies, of both species, showed a significant dependence of
   calcification rate to SST. The fact that SST differentially affects
   coral calcification in female and male colonies, will have repercussions
   on population dynamics of the studied coral species in a global warming
   scenario.},

Abstract = {Changes in the seawater carbonate chemistry (ocean acidification) from
   increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations negatively
   affect many marine calcifying organisms, but may benefit primary
   producers under dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) limitation. To improve
   predictions of the ecological effects of ocean acidification, the net
   gains and losses between the processes of photosynthesis and
   calcification need to be studied jointly on physiological and population
   levels. We studied productivity, respiration, and abundances of the
   symbiont-bearing foraminifer species Marginopora vertebralis on natural
   CO2 seeps in Papua New Guinea and conducted additional studies on
   production and calcification on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) using
   artificially enhanced pCO2. Net oxygen production increased up to 90\%
   with increasing pCO2; temperature, light, and pH together explaining
   61\% of the variance in production. Production increased with increasing
   light and increasing pCO2 and declined at higher temperatures.
   Respiration was also significantly elevated (similar to 25\%), whereas
   calcification was reduced (1639\%) at low pH/high pCO2 compared to
   present-day conditions. In the field, M. vertebralis was absent at three
   CO2 seep sites at pHTotal levels below similar to 7.9 (pCO2 similar to
   700 similar to mu atm), but it was found in densities of over 1000
   similar to m-2 at all three control sites. The study showed that
   endosymbiotic algae in foraminifera benefit from increased DIC
   availability and may be naturally carbon limited. The observed reduction
   in calcification may have been caused either by increased energy demands
   for proton pumping (measured as elevated rates of respiration) or by
   stronger competition for DIC from the more productive symbionts. The net
   outcome of these two competing processes is that M. vertebralis cannot
   maintain populations under pCO2 exceeding 700 similar to mu atm, thus
   are likely to be extinct in the next century.},

Abstract = {The propagation and growth of scleractinian corals under aquaculture
   conditions could reduce the pressure of extractive fishing for
   ornamental species. To fulfil their growth requirements, corals rely on
   a combination of photosynthetic products translocated from symbiotic
   zooxanthellae, and particulate heterotrophic sources. In aquaculture,
   the latter is provided by Artemia sp. nauplii as they provide adequate
   nutrition and promote optimal growth and survival. In this study, we
   evaluated feeding rates and estimated growth rates of cultured
   scleractinian corals. Polyp and colonial nubbins of the coral Galaxea
   fascicularis were randomly assigned to each of three tanks within three
   naturally lit systems under standard conditions. Corals were subjected
   to three feeding treatments: i) fed once or ii) three times weekly, or
   iii) unfed until the end of the trial (two months). The survival rates
   were 98.7\% and 100\% for the colonial and polyp forms, respectively.
   Ingestion rates of Anemia salina nauplii between the three feeding
   treatments were significantly higher for specimens fed 3-times a week
   compared to those two treatments involving a lower feeding frequency
   (individual prey items polyp(-1) 20 min(-1): vs. <= 4, respectively),
   but growth rates of colonial and polyp forms were not significantly
   different with respect to feeding frequency. Mean rate of new polyp
   growth was ca. 4 polyps nubbin(-1) week(-1) for colonial form and ca. 1
   polyp polyp(-1) week(-1) for the polyp form. The high survival and
   growth rates of G. fascicularis, coupled with an apparent low
   heterotrophic prey requirement, make this species an ideal candidate for

Abstract = {Fluorometric measurements of maximum quantum yield (F-v/F-m) and fast
   induction curves (FICs) require coral samples to be dark-adapted (DA).
   Pathways causing dark-reduction of the plastoquinone (PQ) pool are shown
   here to be active in corals. Early morning sunlight and far-red light
   successfully increased F-v/F-m and lowered the O and J steps of FICs in
   corals that were darkened overnight. The thick-tissued massive coral,
   Cyphastrea serailia, was shown to be more prone to reduction of the PQ
   pool, with significant reductions in F-v/F-m occurring after 10 min of
   DA, and elevated J steps occurring within 200 s following a far-red
   flash. In thinner-tissued branching species, Pocillopora damicornis and
   Acropora nobilis, elevation of the J step also occurred within 200 s of
   DA, but a drop in F-v/F-m was only manifested after 30 min. Pre-exposure
   to far-red light is an effective and simple procedure to ensure
   determination of the true maximum quantum yield of Photosystem II (PSII)
   and accurate FICs which require a fully oxidised inter-system electron
   transport chain and open PSII reaction centres.},

Abstract = {Elevated ocean temperatures and agrochemical pollution individually
   threaten inshore coral reefs, but these pressures are likely to occur
   simultaneously. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the combined
   effects of elevated temperature and the photosystem II (PSII) inhibiting
   herbicide diuron on several types of symbiotic algae (diatom,
   dinoflagellate or rhodophyte) of benthic foraminifera in hospite. Diuron
   was shown to evoke a direct effect on photosynthetic efficiency (reduced
   effective PSII quantum yield Delta F/F-m'), while elevated temperatures
   (>30 degrees C, only 2 degrees C above current average summer
   temperatures) were observed to impact photosynthesis more indirectly by
   causing reductions in maximum PSII quantum yield (F-v/F-m), interpreted
   as photodamage. Additionally, elevated temperatures were shown to cause
   bleaching through loss of chlorophyll a in foraminifera hosting either
   diatoms or dinoflagellates. A significant linear correlation was found
   between reduced F-v/F-m and loss of chlorophyll a. In most cases,
   symbionts within foraminifera proved more sensitive to thermal stress in
   the presence of diuron (>= 1 mu g L-1). The mixture toxicity model of
   Independent Action (IA) described the combined effects of temperature
   and diuron on the photosystem of species hosting diatoms or
   dinoflagellates convincingly and in agreement with probabilistic
   statistics, so a response additive joint action can be assumed. We thus
   demonstrate that improving water quality can improve resilience of
   symbiotic phototrophs to projected increases in ocean temperatures. As
   IA described the observed combined effects from elevated temperature and
   diuron stress it may therefore be employed for prediction of untested
   mixtures and for assessing the efficacy of management measures.},

   harvesting complexes (LHCs) in photosynthetic dinoflagellates. We
   analyzed the oligomeric state of PCP isolated from the dinoflagellate
   Symbiodinium, which has received increasing attention in recent years
   because of its role in coral bleaching. Size-exclusion chromatography
   (SEC) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) analysis indicated PCP
   exists as monomers. Native mass spectrometry (native MS) demonstrated
   two oligomeric states of PCP, with the monomeric PCP being dominant. The
   trimerization may not be necessary for PCP to function as a

Abstract = {The stable isotope ratios (delta(18)O and delta(13)C) of the coral
   Porites compressa from the Lakshadweep islands, eastern Arabian Sea,
   preserve environmental parameters related to monsoon-induced upwelling.
   The oxygen isotopic ratios in P. compressa record the seasonal drop in
   sea surface temperature (SST) during the monsoon season. An earlier
   calibration of the coralline delta(18)O with observed changes in SST is
   used to estimate past SST changes and to evaluate the relationship with
   upwelling and rainfall. The seasonal variations in carbon isotope ratios
   seem to be controlled by photosynthesis of the algal symbiont, which in
   turn is modulated by monsoon activities; sedimentation, sediment
   suspension, water current and turbidity. Both delta(18)O and delta(13)C
   in this species do reflect the monsoon clearly. Copyright (C) 1996

Title = {Sensitivity to oxidative stress is not a definite predictor of thermal

Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Coral bleaching, the loss of symbiotic dinoflagellate algae (genus
   Symbiodinium) and/or photosynthetic algal pigments from corals, is
   thought to be primarily triggered by the thermal dysfunction of
   photosynthesis and a consequent build-up of reactive oxygen species.
   However, different corals exhibit differential bleaching
   susceptibilities, perhaps resulting from dissimilar abilities to deal
   with oxidative stress. We therefore tested whether thermal sensitivity
   in Symbiodinium is correlated with the capacity to deal with oxidative
   stress, by comparing the effects of increased temperature and hydrogen
   peroxide (H2O2) concentration on the photosynthetic performance of four
   cultured Symbiodinium ITS2 types (A1, B2, E, and F1) and two freshly
   isolated Symbiodinium ITS2 types (a temperate A-type and B1). Generally,
   the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (F (v)/F (m)) declined in
   Symbiodinium with both increasing thermal and oxidative stress. However,
   not all types followed this pattern. Cultured Symbiodinium A1 showed a
   strong negative response to elevated temperature but little response to
   the addition of H2O2, while cultured F1 showed an increase in F (v)/F
   (m) at elevated temperature but a decline in this parameter to almost
   zero at high H2O2 concentrations. Furthermore, both freshly isolated
   Symbiodinium types appeared to be relatively stress tolerant, with the
   temperate A-type showing an especially high resistance to both
   stressors. In conclusion, a range of Symbiodinium types were shown to
   differ in their susceptibilities to both thermal and oxidative stress,
   though in contrast to our original hypothesis, sensitivity to oxidative
   stress did not necessarily predict thermal sensitivity (or vice versa).},

Abstract = {Global climate change is leading to the rise of ocean temperatures and
   is triggering mass coral bleaching events on reefs around the world. The
   expulsion of the symbiotic dinoflagellate algae is believed to occur as
   a result of damage to the photosynthetic apparatus of these symbionts,
   although the specific site of initial impact is yet to be conclusively
   resolved. Here, the sensitivity of the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) to
   bleaching stress was studied as well as its natural variation between
   seasons. The artificial electron donor, diphenyl carbazide (DPC), was
   added to cultured, freshly isolated and expelled (bleaching treatments
   only) zooxanthellae suspensions. Chl a fluorescence and oxygen
   production measurements showed that upon addition of DPC, no restoration
   of diminished photochemical efficiency occurred under control or
   bleaching conditions. This result was consistent between 12 h and 5 d
   bleaching treatments on Pocilloporadamicornis, indicating that the OEC
   is not the primary site of damage, and that zooxanthellae expulsion from
   the host is a nonselective process with respect to the functioning of
   the OEC. Further experiments measuring fast induction curves (FICs)
   revealed that in both summer and winter, the temperature when OEC
   function was lost occurred between 7 degrees C and 14 degrees C above
   the sea surface temperature. FIC and oxygen production measurements of
   P. damicornis during exposure to bleaching stress demonstrated that the
   thermotolerance of the OEC increased above the temperature of the
   bleaching treatment over a 4 h period. This finding indicates that the
   OEC has the capacity to acclimate between seasons and remains functional
   at temperatures well above bleaching thresholds.},

Title = {Alternative Photosynthetic Electron Transfers and Bleaching Phenotypes
   Upon Acute Heat Stress in <i>Symbiodinium</i> and <i>Breviolum</i> spp.
   (Symbiodiniaceae) in Culture},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},

Month = {OCT 22},
Abstract = {The breakdown of the symbiosis between cnidarians and Symbiodiniaceae
   often occurs upon periods of elevated sea surface temperature and gives
   rise to bleaching events that affect coral reefs worldwide. In this
   respect, an impairment of photosynthesis would be responsible for
   light-dependent generation of toxic reactive oxygen species putatively
   contributing to death of symbionts and/or host cells. In some
   Symbiodiniaceae species, alternative photosynthetic electron flows (AEF)
   have been documented to occur upon a shift to high temperature, possibly
   contributing to photoprotection and to the balance of energetic ratio
   between photoproduced ATP and NADPH. By using a combination of in vivo
   spectrofluorimetric and oximetric techniques, we studied the capacity
   for electron rerouting toward oxygen and cyclic electron flow (CEF)
   around photosystem I in eight Symbiodiniaceae in culture belonging to
   Symbiodinium and Breviolum genera upon an acute shift from 25 to 33
   degrees C. CEF capacity was determined as the kinetic of PSI primary
   donor P700 re-reduction in the presence of DCMU, a PSII inhibitor. An
   active oxygen uptake in light was estimated by comparing net oxygen
   evolution and relative electron transport rate of PSII at different
   light intensities. Among strains that showed elevated capacity for both
   AEF, some were thermotolerant while others were thermosensitive.
   Conversely, in some thermotolerant strains, capacities for these AEF
   were low upon acute heat stress. A principal component analysis of these
   results indicates that the long-term heat tolerant/bleached phenotype of
   cultured Symbiodinium and Breviolum spp. is not correlated with a
   capacity for different AEF across isolates during early onset of acute
   heat stress.},

Title = {Photoacoustics: a novel application to the determination of

Abstract = {We present here a novel application of photoacoustics to the monitoring
   and study of the physiological status of zooxanthellate corals. Until
   now, the method has only been applied in homogeneous phytoplankton
   cultures and field samples. Corals are among the world's most productive
   ecosystems because they host symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae)
   that provide them with a large amount of photosynthates for their energy
   requirements. Coral reefs face unprecedented pressures on local,
   regional, and global scales due to climate change and anthropogenic
   disturbances. Responses to such stress are often a decrease in the
   photosynthetic efficiency of the symbiotic dinoflagellates, as well as
   bleaching, which involves the mass expulsion of these symbionts or loss
   of their pigments. Photosynthesis is a sensitive indicator of stress in
   plants and plays a central role in the nutrition of symbiotic
   invertebrates. Our aim was to examine the applicability of
   photoacoustics, developed by us for ecological work with phytoplankton,
   to the study of symbiotic dinoflagellates in situ. We have determined
   areal chlorophyll content and light energy storage efficiency with three
   zooxanthellate coelenterates, two corals and one hydrozoan, hosting
   symbiotic algae. We also present the effect of temperature elevation on
   the decrease in photosynthetic efficiency of the symbiotic coral
   Stylophora pistillata determined by photoacoustics. Our results
   demonstrate the potential, power, and convenience of photoacoustics in
   following bleaching-related changes in coral pigmentation, in the
   photosynthetic energy storage efficiency of corals, and in its
   usefulness in diagnosing its health in relation to environmental
   factors, in the example presented here, seawater warming.},

Abstract = {Global change, including rising temperatures and acidification,
   threatens corals globally. Although bleaching events reveal fine-scale
   patterns of resilience, traits enabling persistence under global change
   remain elusive. We conducted a 95-d controlled-laboratory experiment
   investigating how duration of exposure to warming (similar to 28, 31
   degrees C), acidification (pCO(2) similar to 343 {[}present day],
   similar to 663 {[}end of century], similar to 3109 {[}extreme] mu atm),
   and their combination influences physiology of reef-building corals
   (Siderastrea siderea, Pseudodiploria strigosa) from two reef zones on
   the Belize Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. Every 30 d, net
   calcification rate, host protein and carbohydrate, chlorophyll a, and
   symbiont density were quantified for the same coral individual to
   characterize acclimation potential under global change. Coral
   physiologies of the two species were differentially affected by
   stressors and exposure duration was found to modulate these responses.
   Siderastrea siderea exhibited resistance to end of century pCO(2) and
   temperature stress, but calcification was negatively affected by extreme
   pCO(2). However, S. siderea calcification rates remained positive after
   95 d of extreme pCO(2) conditions, suggesting acclimation. In contrast,
   P. strigosa was more negatively influenced by elevated temperatures,
   which reduced most physiological parameters. An exception was nearshore
   P. strigosa, which maintained calcification rates under elevated
   temperature, suggesting local adaptation to the warmer environment of
   their natal reef zone. This work highlights how tracking coral
   physiology across various exposure durations can capture acclimatory
   responses to global change stressors.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs around the world have been affected by a climate-change
   induced phenomenon known as ``coral bleaching,{''} which is caused by
   the interaction between high irradiance and elevated seawater
   temperatures, and involves the mass expulsion of Symbiodiniaceae from
   anemones, sponges, and corals. The primary drivers of this phenomenon
   are the inherent genetic variability in the Family Symbiodiniaceae, and
   the variability in the abiotic environment for variables such as
   irradiance and temperature. Recent experiments have either disregarded
   the important interactive role of irradiance or have suggested that
   photooxidative stress is not a prerequisite for coral bleaching because
   certain reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be produced in the dark. Here,
   fluorescent probes are used as proxies for the relative concentration of
   ROS in different genera of cultured Symbiodiniaceae under varying
   thermal and light conditions. The results show that taxon-specific
   patterns of the concentration of ROS are observed but that all genera
   tested produced significantly greater amounts of superoxide radicals and
   hydrogen peroxide, compared to singlet oxygen, when exposed to high
   light and thermal stress. These results are contextualized in relation
   to the primary drivers of ROS production and the photo-physiological
   basis for differences in ROS production that may then be correlated with
   symbiont driven coral bleaching.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {64},

Abstract = {As ocean temperatures rise, investigations into what the physiological
   effects will be on the symbiotic microalga Symbiodinium, and how these
   may play into the cnidarian bleaching response, have highlighted the
   contribution of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Previous studies have
   laid this groundwork using a limited number of Symbiodinium phylotypes,
   and so this study aims to expand this understanding by exploring the
   effects of sub-lethal elevated temperatures on the physiological
   response of seven genetically distinct types of Symbiodinium, including
   A1, B1, B2, C1, D, E1, and F2. The production of ROS (at 26 A degrees C,
   29 A degrees C, 30 A degrees C, and 31 A degrees C) and activity of the
   antioxidants catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (at 26 A
   degrees C and 31 A degrees C) were measured as indicators of sensitivity
   or tolerance to heat stress. Symbiodinium types B1 and C1 were the most
   thermally sensitive, with C1 producing the highest amount of ROS at
   elevated temperatures. Types A1 and F2 were tolerant, having no increase
   in ROS production, and were the only types to increase both CAT and SOD
   activity with temperature stress. Type B2 had decreased ROS production
   and elevation of CAT activity, while type E1 had decreased levels of ROS
   production at elevated temperatures. Type D was the only Symbiodinium
   type to remain unaffected by elevated temperatures. These results are
   consistent with previous findings of relative sensitivity or tolerance
   to elevated temperatures, specifically with regards to types A1, B1, and
   F2. The inclusion of types B2, C1, D, and E1 provides further new
   evidence of how types differ in their thermal responses, suggesting
   differing mechanisms exist in the Symbiodnium response to higher
   temperature and highlighting the importance of establishing symbiont
   identity when exploring the response of intact associations to this type
   of stress.},

Title = {Bacterial Community Shifts during Polyp Bail-Out Induction in
   <i>Pocillopora</i> Corals},
Journal = {MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {AUG 17},
Abstract = {Polyp bail-out constitutes both a stress response and an asexual
   reproductive strategy that potentially facilitates dispersal of some
   scleractinian corals, including several dominant reef-building taxa in
   the family Pocilloporidae. Recent studies have proposed that
   microorganisms may be involved in onset and progression of polyp
   bail-out. However, changes in the coral microbiome during polyp bail-out
   have not been investigated. In this study, we induced polyp bail-out in
   Pocillopora corals using hypersaline and hyperthermal methods. Bacterial
   community dynamics during bail-out induction were examined using the
   V5-V6 region of the 16S-rRNA gene. From 70 16S-rRNA gene libraries
   constructed from coral tissues, 1,980 OTUs were identified.
   Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria consistently constituted the
   dominant bacterial taxa in all coral tissue samples. Onset of polyp
   bail-out was characterized by increased relative abundance of
   Alphaproteobacteria and decreased abundance of Gammaproteobacteria in
   both induction experiments, with the shift being more prominent in
   response to elevated temperature than to elevated salinity. Four OTUs,
   affiliated with Thalassospira, Marisediminitalea, Rhodobacteraceae, and
   Myxococcales, showed concurrent abundance increases at the onset of
   polyp bail-out in both experiments, suggesting potential microbial
   causes of this coral stress response.IMPORTANCE Polyp bail-out
   represents both a stress response and an asexual reproductive strategy
   with significant implications for reshaping tropical coral reefs in
   response to global climate change. Although earlier studies have
   suggested that coral-associated microbiomes likely contribute to
   initiation of polyp bail-out in scleractinian corals, there have been no
   studies of coral microbiome shifts during polyp bail-out. In this study,
   we present the first investigation of changes in bacterial symbionts
   during two experiments in which polyp bail-out was induced by different
   environmental stressors. These results provide a background of coral
   microbiome dynamics during polyp bail-out development. Increases in
   abundance of Thalassospira, Marisediminitalea, Rhodobacteraceae, and
   Myxococcales that occurred in both experiments suggest that these
   bacteria are potential microbial causes of polyp bail-out, shedding
   light on the proximal triggering mechanism of this coral stress
   response.
   Polyp bail-out represents both a stress response and an asexual
   reproductive strategy with significant implications for reshaping
   tropical coral reefs in response to global climate change. Although
   earlier studies have suggested that coral-associated microbiomes likely
   contribute to initiation of polyp bail-out in scleractinian corals,
   there have been no studies of coral microbiome shifts during polyp
   bail-out.},

Title = {Broad thermal tolerance of the symbiotic dinoflagellate <i>Symbiodinium

Abstract = {The sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima (Brandt) hosts two species of
   symbiotic dinoflagellates, known as zooxanthellae, which coexist within
   the host at southern latitudes only. One of these species, Symbiodinium
   muscatinei LaJeunesse et Trench, has a broad latitudinal distribution,
   occurring in intertidal anemones from Washington state to Southern
   California. To investigate whether high thermal tolerance contributes to
   the ability of S. muscatinei to inhabit anemones from northern and
   southern regions, the upper thermal tolerance limit for photosynthesis
   of symbionts in northern (48 degrees 24' N) populations of A.
   elegantissima was determined by subjecting anemones to a gradual
   increase in temperature from 12 degrees C to 30 degrees C over a 10-week
   period. Light-saturated photosynthetic rates of isolated zooxanthellae
   were the same over the range of 12 degrees C-24 degrees C and declined
   significantly at 26 degrees C, which is 14 degrees C and 5 degrees C
   above average summertime seawater temperatures in northern Puget Sound
   and Southern California, respectively. At 28 degrees C, zooxanthellae
   isolated from the anemones, and those expelled by their hosts, exhibited
   extremely low rates of photosynthesis and highly reduced chl content.
   The photosynthetic rates and chl content of expelled zooxanthellae were
   lower than those of retained zooxanthellae. The high thermal tolerance
   of S. muscatinei isolated from northern populations of anemones supports
   the broad latitudinal distribution of this symbiont, allowing it to
   coexist with S. californium (\#383, Banaszak et al. 1993) in southern
   populations of anemones.},

Title = {Lipids and stable carbon isotopes in two species of Hawaiian corals,

   bleaching event},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {145},

Abstract = {Mass coral bleaching events have occurred on a global scale throughout
   the world's tropical oceans and can result in large-scale coral
   mortality and degradation of coral reef communities. Coral bleaching has
   often been attributed to periods of above normal seawater temperatures
   and/or calm conditions with high levels of ultraviolet radiation.
   Unusually high shallow-water temperature (>29degreesC) in Kaneohe Bay,
   Hawaii, USA, in late summer (20 August-9 September) and fall (1-7
   October) of 1996 produced visible bleaching of two dominant corals,
   Porites compressa Dana, 1864 and Montipora verrucosa Dana, 1864. The
   present study examined chlorophyll a (chl a), total lipid
   concentrations, and lipid class composition in corals of both species in
   which the entire colony was non-bleached, moderately bleached, or
   bleached. Skeletal, host tissue, and algal symbiont delta(13)C values
   were also measured in non-bleached and bleached colonies. In additional
   unevenly bleached colonies, paired samples were collected from bleached
   upper surfaces and non-bleached sides. Samples were collected on 20
   November 1996 during the coral recovery phase, a time when seawater
   temperatures had been back to normal for over a month. Chl a levels were
   significantly lower in bleached colonies of both species compared with
   non-bleached specimens, and in bleached areas of unevenly bleached
   single colonies. Total lipid concentrations were significantly lower in
   bleached P. compressa compared with non-bleached colonies, whereas total
   lipid concentrations were the same in bleached and non-bleached M.
   verrucosa colonies. The proportion of triacylglycerols and wax esters
   was lower in bleached colonies of both species. Both bleached and
   non-bleached M. verrucosa had from similar to17\% to 35\% of their
   lipids in the form of diacylglycerol, while this class was absent in P.
   compressa. delta(13)C was not significantly different in the host tissue
   and algal symbiont fractions in non-bleached and bleached samples of
   either species. This suggests that the ratio of carbon acquired
   heterotrophically versus photosynthetically was the same regardless of
   condition. Skeletal delta(13)C was significantly lower in bleached than
   in non-bleached corals. This is consistent with previous findings that
   lower rates of photosynthesis during bleaching results in lower skeletal
   delta(13)C values. The two species in this study displayed different
   lipid class compositions and total lipid depletions following bleaching,
   suggesting that there is a difference in their metabolism of lipid
   reserves and/or in their temporal responses to bleaching and recovery.},

Abstract = {Dinoflagellates from the Symbiodiniaceae family and corals have an
   ecologically important endosymbiotic relationship. Scleractinian corals
   cannot survive for long periods without their symbionts. These algae,
   also known as zooxanthellae, on the other hand, thrives outside the
   coral cells. The free-living populations of zooxanthellae are essential
   for the resilience of the coral to environmental stressors such as
   temperature anomalies and ocean acidification. Yet, little is known
   about how ocean acidification may affect the free-living zooxanthellae.
   In this study we aimed to test morphological, physiological and
   biochemical responses of zooxanthellae from the Symbiodinium genus
   isolated from the coral Mussismilia braziliensis, endemic to the
   Brazilian coast, to acidification led by increased atmospheric CO2. We
   tested whether photosynthetic yield, cell ultrastructure, cell density
   and lipid profile would change after up to 16 days of exposure to pH 7.5
   in an atmospheric pCO(2) of 1633 mu atm. Photosynthetic yield and cell
   density were negatively affected and chloroplasts showed vesiculated
   thylakoids, indicating morphological damage. Moreover, Symbiodinium
   fatty acid profile drastically changed in acidified condition, showing
   lower polyunsaturated fatty acids and higher saturated fatty acids
   contents, when compared to the control, non-acidified condition. These
   results show that seawater acidification as an only stressor causes
   significant changes in the physiology, biochemistry and ultrastructure
   of free-living Symbiodinium.},

Title = {Reef building and carbonate production modes in the west-central Tethys
   during the Cenozoic},
Journal = {MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {83},
Pages = {261-304},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Changing components, rock textures, lithofacies, platform types and
   architecture throughout time are unique characteristics of carbonate
   rocks. Characterizing these attributes has been approached by 1)
   building reference models for specific Phanerozoic intervals, 2)
   recognizing the climatic impact in modulating carbonate production, and
   3) analyzing the influence of changing bio-geochemical conditions. The
   reference-model approach is mostly based on biological evolution, the
   climatic-impact approach emphasizes temperature, and the bio-geochemical
   approach considers the changes in Mg/Ca ratios and Ca++ concentrations
   in the oceans. To date, however, an analysis integrating all of these
   factors is still missing. The analysis presented here includes all these
   factors but also CO2, which is fundamental for both photosynthesis and
   CaCO3 precipitation.
   Here we analyze the waxing and waning of Cenozoic reef limestones from
   the central Tethys region through several steps: 1) on the basis of rock
   volume, rock textures, associated sediments and light dependent skeletal
   components, as records of light penetration and wave energy (depth); 2)
   on global environmental conditions (delta C-13, delta O-18, pCO(2),
   temperature); and 3) on the basis of functionality, nutritional
   requirements and available resources.
   Through the Cenozoic, water motion, whether induced by surface or
   internal waves or by currents, increased as the thermal gradients
   strengthened, both with depth and with latitude. Active water motion is
   essential for plankton catchers such as corals, but less so for many
   larger benthic foraminifers (LBF). Pycnoclines in the meso-oligophotic
   zone would then favor the benthic plankton catchers such as corals, but
   would be detrimental for many LBF. Warm temperatures favored LBF. The
   Eocene LBF families predominated during lowering of atmospheric pCO(2)
   by using respiratory CO2 to enhance the symbiont production of
   photosynthates under oligotrophic conditions and limited turbulence,
   whereas the Miocene families had to adapt to a progressive increase in
   turbulence. The eurythermal coralline red algae, however, became
   preponderant producers in the mesophotic zone during times when the
   delta C-13 was relatively high. This explains two apparent paradoxes: 1)
   corals thrive best when the Earth's high latitudes cool, and 2) the
   dominance of corals and LBF is inversely correlated, despite they both
   require tropical conditions and have similar trophic strategies
   (mixotrophy). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Ocean warming is an extreme environment event that has profound and
   lasting impacts on Symbiodiniaceae. However, their response mechanisms
   to elevated temperature exposure are poorly understood. In this study,
   the physiological and transcriptional responses of Effrenium voratum
   (Symbiodiniaceae) to ocean warming were examined. After exposure to 30
   degrees C, no significant variations in growth, chlorophyll a, or
   photosynthetic and respiration rates were observed, while a higher
   temperature (34 degrees C) significantly reduced these physiological
   measurements. Meanwhile, lipid content and fatty acid composition were
   altered at high temperature (i.e., elevated degree of fatty acid
   saturation). Such biochemical constituents likely contributed to the
   mitigation of the negative effects of elevated temperatures.
   Furthermore, higher expression levels of genes related to the synthesis
   and elongation of fatty acids were detected at high temperature. The
   adjustment of lipids and fatty acid composition may be a potential
   mechanism by which E. voratum may survive under future global warming.

Title = {The Gill Microbiota of <i>Argopecten purpuratus</i> Scallop Is Dominated
   by Symbiotic Campylobacterota and Upwelling Intensification
   Differentially Affects Their Abundance},

Abstract = {Despite the great importance of gills for bivalve mollusks (respiration,
   feeding, immunity), the microbiota associated with this tissue has
   barely been characterized in scallops. The scallop Argopecten purpuratus
   is an important economic resource that is cultivated in areas where
   coastal upwelling is intensifying by climate change, potentially
   affecting host-microbiota interactions. Thus, we first characterized the
   bacterial community present in gills from cultivated scallops (by 16S
   rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) and assessed their stability and
   functional potential in animals under farm and laboratory conditions.
   Results showed that under both conditions the gill bacterial community
   is dominated by the phylum Campylobacterota (57\%), which displays a
   chemoautotrophic potential that could contribute to scallop nutrition.
   Within this phylum, two phylotypes, namely symbionts A and B, were the
   most abundant; being, respectively, taxonomically affiliated to
   symbionts with nutritional functions in mussel gills, and to uncultured
   bacteria present in coral mucus. Additionally, in situ hybridization and
   scanning electron microscopy analyses allowed us to detect these
   symbionts in the gills of A. purpuratus. Given that shifts in upwelling
   phenology can cause disturbances to ecosystems, affecting bacteria that
   provide beneficial functions to the host, we further assessed the
   changes in the abundance of the two symbionts (via qPCR) in response to
   a simulated upwelling intensification. The exposure to combined
   decreasing values in the temperature, pH, and oxygen levels (upwelling
   conditions) favored the dominance of symbiont B over symbiont A;
   suggesting that symbiont abundances are modulated by these environmental
   changes. Overall, results showed that changes in the main
   Campylobacterota phylotypes in response to upwelling intensification
   could affect its symbiotic function in A. purpuratus under future
   climate change scenarios. These results provide the first insight into
   understanding how scallop gill-microbial systems adapt and respond to
   climate change stressors, which could be critical for managing health,
   nutrition, and scallop aquaculture productivity.},

Title = {Selection of mesophotic habitats by <i>Oculina patagonica</i> in the
   Eastern Mediterranean Sea following global warming},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 13},
Abstract = {Globally, species are migrating in an attempt to track optimal isotherms
   as climate change increasingly warms existing habitats. Stony corals are
   severely threatened by anthropogenic warming, which has resulted in
   repeated mass bleaching and mortality events. Since corals are sessile
   as adults and with a relatively old age of sexual maturity, they are
   slow to latitudinally migrate, but corals may also migrate vertically to
   deeper, cooler reefs. Herein we describe vertical migration of the
   Mediterranean coral Oculina patagonica from less than 10 m depth to > 30
   m. We suggest that this range shift is a response to rapidly warming sea
   surface temperatures on the Israeli Mediterranean coastline. In contrast
   to the vast latitudinal distance required to track temperature change,
   this species has migrated deeper where summer water temperatures are up
   to 2 degrees C cooler. Comparisons of physiology, morphology, trophic
   position, symbiont type, and photochemistry between deep and shallow
   conspecifics revealed only a few depth-specific differences. At this
   study site, shallow colonies typically inhabit low light environments
   (caves, crevices) and have a facultative relationship with
   photosymbionts. We suggest that this existing phenotype aided
   colonization of the mesophotic zone. This observation highlights the
   potential for other marine species to vertically migrate.},

Abstract = {Increases in seawater temperature impair photosynthesis
   (photoinhibition) in the symbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium within
   cnidarian hosts, such as corals and sea anemones, and may destroy their
   symbiotic relationship. Although the degree of photoinhibition in
   Symbiodinium under heat stress differs among strains, the differences in
   their responses to increased temperatures, including cyclic electron
   flow (CEF), which sustains photoprotective thermal energy dissipation,
   have not been investigated. Here, we examined CEF in cultured
   Symbiodinium cells or those in an endosymbiotic relationship within a
   cnidarian host. The light-dependent reduction of the primary electron
   donor photosystem I, i.e. P700(+), was enhanced in any Symbiodinium cell
   by increasing temperatures, indicating CEF was induced by heat, which
   was accompanied by thermal energy dissipation activation. The critical
   temperatures for inducing CEF were different among Symbiodinium strains.
   The clade A strains with greater susceptibility to photoinhibition,
   OTcH-1 and Y106, exhibited higher CEF activities under moderate heat
   stress than a more phototolerant clade B strain Mf1.05b, suggesting that
   the observed CEF induction was not a preventive measure but a stress
   response in Symbiodinium.},

Title = {Transcriptional Response of Two Core Photosystem Genes in
   <i>Symbiodinium</i> spp. Exposed to Thermal Stress},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 7},
Abstract = {Mutualistic symbioses between scleractinian corals and endosymbiotic
   dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium spp.) are the foundation of coral reef
   ecosystems. For many coral-algal symbioses, prolonged episodes of
   thermal stress damage the symbiont's photosynthetic capability,
   resulting in its expulsion from the host. Despite the link between
   photosynthetic competency and symbiont expulsion, little is known about
   the effect of thermal stress on the expression of photosystem genes in
   Symbiodinium. This study used real-time PCR to monitor the transcript
   abundance of two important photosynthetic reaction center genes, psbA
   (encoding the D1 protein of photosystem II) and psaA (encoding the P-700
   protein of photosystem I), in four cultured isolates (representing
   ITS2-types A13, A20, B1, and F2) and two in hospite Symbiodinium spp.
   within the coral Pocillopora spp. (ITS2-types C1b-c and D1). Both
   cultured and in hospite Symbiodinium samples were exposed to elevated
   temperatures (32 degrees C) over a 7-day period and examined for changes
   in photochemistry and transcript abundance. Symbiodinium A13 and C1b-c
   (both thermally sensitive) demonstrated significant declines in both
   psbA and psaA during the thermal stress treatment, whereas the
   transcript levels of the other Symbiodinium types remained stable. The
   downregulation of both core photosystem genes could be the result of
   several different physiological mechanisms, but may ultimately limit
   repair rates of photosynthetic proteins, rendering some Symbiodinium
   spp. especially susceptible to thermal stress.},

Year = {2006},
Volume = {79},

Abstract = {A simple micro-culturing technique is described for determining specific
   growth rates of cultured Symbiodinium spp. Micro-cultures were prepared
   by transferring 200 mu L fresh test medium containing 2-10 Symbiodinium
   cells to wells of a flat bottom 96-well plate. Cultures were incubated
   undisturbed to eliminate potential adverse effects of mixing or
   agitation. Specific growth rates were determined from daily cell counts
   obtained using an inverted microscope. Sufficient data for the
   calculation of specific growth rates were collected in 7-10 d. Specific
   growth rates approached the theoretical maximum of one division per day
   for dinoflagellates. Similar growth rates also were observed with
   undisturbed 30 ml cultures prepared in sealed polyethylene sample bags.
   However, bag cultures that were mixed daily exhibited no growth; when
   daily mixing was stopped, cultures grew at rates similar to undisturbed
   bag cultures indicating that undisturbed cultures were optimal for
   Symbiodinium growth. The micro-culturing technique was used to examine
   the effects of temperature and salinity on the growth of six
   Symbiodinium spp. Growth was differentially affected by incubation
   temperatures of 27, 29, 31, 33, and 35 degrees C as well as by culture
   medium having salinities of 10, 15, 20, 25, 35, 40, and 45. This
   micro-culturing technique offers a relatively rapid approach for
   conducting growth studies with Symbiodinium spp.},

Abstract = {We simultaneously examined seasonal fluctuations in maximum quantum
   yield (F-v/F-m), cell density and genotypic clade composition of
   zooxanthellae in the sympatric corals Pavona divaricata and P. decussata
   at a high latitude site in Okinawa, Japan. The 2 species had different
   responses to seasonal changes in light and seawater temperature. P.
   decussata was associated only with clade C zooxanthellae (at all
   sampling times) while genotypic clade composition fluctuated in P.
   divaricata. Three colonies of P. divaricata harbored clade D throughout
   the year and the other 7 colonies changed clade type from C to D or vice
   versa, or contained a mixture of both clades on some sampling occasions.
   Though neither coral species suffered bleaching during the experimental
   period, there were Fv/Fm decreases in P. decussata and P. divaricata
   harboring clade C during cold and warm seasons; F-v/F-m,, of P.
   divaricata harboring clade D was stable. When exposed to low or high
   temperature under normal or high light, P. divaricata harboring clade D
   was less damaged and Photosystem II recovery was faster than in P.
   decussata harboring clade C. These results suggest that the sympatric
   congeneric corals have different symbiont switching flexibilities and
   this difference might account for the observed difference in stress
   susceptibility between the two species. In high-latitude reefs, both
   winter low temperatures and summer high temperatures may be potential
   stressors that cause coral bleaching, at least in corals with high clade
   C zooxanthellar fidelity.},

Abstract = {Ocean acidification, resulting from rising atmospheric carbon dioxide
   concentrations, is a pervasive stressor that can affect many marine
   organisms and their symbionts. Studies which examine the host physiology
   and microbial communities have shown a variety of responses to the ocean
   acidification process. Recently, several studies were conducted based on
   field experiments, which take place in natural CO2 vents, exposing the
   host to natural environmental conditions of varying pH. This study
   examines the sea anemone Anemonia viridis which is found naturally along
   the pH gradient in Ischia, Italy, with an aim to characterize whether
   exposure to pH impacts the holobiont. The physiological parameters of A.
   viridis (Symbiodinium density, protein, and chlorophyll a+c
   concentration) and its microbial community were monitored. Although
   reduction in pH was seen to have had an impact on composition and
   diversity of associated microbial communities, no significant changes
   were observed in A. viridis physiology, and no microbial stress
   indicators (i.e., pathogens, antibacterial activity, etc.) were
   detected. In light of these results, it appears that elevated CO2 does
   not have a negative influence on A. viridis that live naturally in the
   site. This suggests that natural long-term exposure and dynamic diverse
   microbial communities may contribute to the acclimation process of the
   host in a changing pH environment.},

Abstract = {As anthropogenic climate change is an ongoing concern, scientific
   investigations on its impacts on coral reefs are increasing. Although
   impacts of combined ocean acidification (OA) and temperature stress (T)
   on reef-building scleractinian corals have been studied at the genus,
   species and population levels, there are little data available on how
   individual corals respond to combined OA and anomalous temperatures. In
   this study, we exposed individual colonies of Acropora digitifera,
   Montipora digitata and Porites cylindrica to four pCO(2)-temperature
   treatments including 400 mu atm-28 degrees C, 400 mu atm-31 degrees C,
   1000 mu atm-28 degrees C and 1000 mu atm-31 degrees C for 26 days.
   Physiological parameters including calcification, protein content,
   maximum photosynthetic efficiency, Symbiodinium density, and chlorophyll
   content along with Symbiodinium type of each colony were examined. Along
   with intercolonial responses, responses of individual colonies versus
   pooled data to the treatments were investigated. The main results were:
   1) responses to either OA or T or their combination were different
   between individual colonies when considering physiological functions; 2)
   tolerance to either OA or T was not synonymous with tolerance to the
   other parameter; 3) tolerance to both OA and T did not necessarily lead
   to tolerance of OA and T combined (OAT) at the same time; 4) OAT had
   negative, positive or no impacts on physiological functions of coral
   colonies; and 5) pooled data were not representative of responses of all
   individual colonies. Indeed, the pooled data obscured actual responses
   of individual colonies or presented a response that was not observed in
   any individual. From the results of this study we recommend improving
   experimental designs of studies investigating physiological responses of
   corals to climate change by complementing them with colony-specific
   examinations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Micronutrient content drives elementome variability amongst the
   Symbiodiniaceae},
Journal = {BMC PLANT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 9},
Abstract = {Background Elements are the basis of life on Earth, whereby organisms
   are essentially evolved chemical substances that dynamically interact
   with each other and their environment. Determining species elemental
   quotas (their elementome) is a key indicator for their success across
   environments with different resource availabilities. Elementomes remain
   undescribed for functionally diverse dinoflagellates within the family
   Symbiodiniaceae that includes coral endosymbionts. We used dry
   combustion and ICP-MS to assess whether Symbiodiniaceae (ten isolates
   spanning five genera Breviolum, Cladocopium, Durusdinium, Effrenium,
   Symbiodinium) maintained under long-term nutrient replete conditions
   have unique elementomes (six key macronutrients and nine micronutrients)
   that would reflect evolutionarily conserved preferential elemental
   acquisition. For three isolates we assessed how elevated temperature
   impacted their elementomes. Further, we tested whether Symbiodiniaceae
   conform to common stoichiometric hypotheses (e.g., the growth rate
   hypothesis) documented in other marine algae. This study considers
   whether Symbiodiniaceae isolates possess unique elementomes reflective
   of their natural ecologies, evolutionary histories, and resistance to
   environmental change. Results Symbiodiniaceae isolates maintained under
   long-term luxury uptake conditions, all exhibited highly divergent
   elementomes from one another, driven primarily by differential content
   of micronutrients. All N:P and C:P ratios were below the Redfield ratio
   values, whereas C:N was close to the Redfield value. Elevated
   temperature resulted in a more homogenised elementome across isolates.
   The Family-level elementome was (C19.8N2.6 P1.0S18.8K0.7Ca0.1) center
   dot 1000 (Fe55.7Mn5.6Sr2.3Zn0.8Ni0.5Se0.3Cu0.2Mo0.1V0.04) mmol
   Phosphorous(-1) versus (C25.4N3.1P1.0S23.1K0.9Ca0.4) center dot 1000
   (Fe66.7Mn6.3Sr7.2Zn0.8Ni0.4Se0.2Cu0.2Mo0.2V0.05) mmol Phosphorous (-1)
   at 27.4 +/- 0.4 degrees C and 30.7 +/- 0.01 degrees C, respectively.
   Symbiodiniaceae isolates tested here conformed to some, but not all,
   stoichiometric principles. Conclusions Elementomes for Symbiodiniaceae
   diverge from those reported for other marine algae, primarily via lower
   C:N:P and different micronutrient expressions. Long-term maintenance of
   Symbiodiniaceae isolates in culture under common nutrient replete
   conditions suggests isolates have evolutionary conserved preferential
   uptake for certain elements that allows these unique elementomes to be
   identified. Micronutrient content (normalised to phosphorous) commonly
   increased in the Symbiodiniaceae isolates in response to elevated
   temperature, potentially indicating a common elemental signature to
   warming.},

Abstract = {The impetus for this study was the mass bleaching event of giant clams
   in 1997-1998 at several reefs in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR,
   Australia). From September until December 1999, the study investigated
   the effects of high light intensities and increased temperature
   accompanied by a nutrient limitation on the metabolism of Tridacna
   gigas, to test, if these environmental changes can induce bleaching. In
   a 50-day trial similar conditions of the mass bleaching event were
   imitated stressing clams, collected from Orpheus Island and Nelly Bay,
   by a two- to threefold light intensity and an increased temperature of
   4-6 degreesC. The objectives of the experiments were to determine
   whether high light intensities can induce changes in chlorophyll content
   or alter zooxanthella cell sizes and populations in the tissue. After 50
   days of exposure to high light intensity the mantle tissue of stressed
   clams exhibited a decreased number of zooxanthellae per unit area from
   19.8 +/- 0.8 (x 10(7).cm(-2)) to 0.2 +/- 0.2 (x 10(7.)cm(-2)) (Mean +/-
   CL). Additionally, the average cell size of zooxanthellae were downsized
   from 7.4 +/- 0.1 mum to 5.3 +/- 0.1 mum (mean CL). Subsequently, the
   chlorophyll content of both, chl a and chl c, declined as well, chl a
   from 192 +/- 4 to 0.1 +/- 0.1 mug.ml(-1) and chl c(1) from 145 +/- 6 to
   0 mug.ml(-1) (mean CL). This study shows that increased light intensity
   and temperature are the main causes for bleaching in giant clams. Thus,
   the study confirmed the four major aspects involved in bleaching: (1)
   loss of symbiotic algae, (2) decrease of chl a/c(1) in the remaining
   symbiotic algae, (3) retention of small zooxanthellae in the tissue and
   (4) release of ammonium (NH4+) into the water column while nutrient
   uptake of ammonium was largely blocked. (C) 2002

Abstract = {Warming and nutrient limitation are stressors known to weaken the health
   of microalgae. In situations of stress, access to energy reserves can
   minimize physiological damage. Because of its widespread requirements in
   biochemical processes, iron is an important trace metal, especially for
   photosynthetic organisms. Lowered iron availability in oceans
   experiencing rising temperatures may contribute to the thermal
   sensitivity of reef-building corals, which rely on mutualisms with
   dinoflagellates to survive. To test the influence of iron concentration
   on thermal sensitivity, the physiological responses of cultured
   symbiotic dinoflagellates (genus Breviolum; family Symbiodiniaceae) were
   evaluated when exposed to increasing temperatures (26 to 30 degrees C)
   and iron concentrations ranging from replete (500 pM Fe') to limiting
   (50 pM Fe') under a diurnal light cycle with saturating radiance.
   Declines in photosynthetic efficiency at elevated temperatures indicated
   sensitivity to heat stress. Furthermore, five times the amount of iron
   was needed to reach exponential growth during heat stress (50 pM Fe ` at
   26-28 degrees C vs. 250 pM Fe ` at 30 degrees C). In treatments where
   exponential growth was reached, Breviolum psygmophilum grew faster than
   B.minutum, possibly due to greater cellular contents of iron and other
   trace metals. The metal composition of B.psygmophilum shifted only at
   the highest temperature (30 degrees C), whereas changes in B.minutum
   were observed at lower temperatures (28 degrees C). The influence of
   iron availability in modulating each alga's response to thermal stress
   suggests the importance of trace metals to the health of coral-algal
   mutualisms. Ultimately, a greater ability to acquire scarce metals may
   improve the tolerance of corals to physiological stressors and
   contribute to the differences in performance associated with hosting one
   symbiont species over another.},

Abstract = {Stable endosymbiotic relationships between cnidarian animals and
   dinoflagellate algae are vital for sustaining coral reef ecosystems.
   Recent studies have shown that elevated seawater temperatures can cause
   the collapse of their endosymbiosis, known as `bleaching', and result in
   mass mortality. However, the molecular interplay between temperature
   responses and symbiotic states still remains unclear. To identify
   candidate genes relevant to the symbiotic stability, we performed
   transcriptomic analyses under multiple conditions using the symbiotic
   and apo-symbiotic (symbiont free) Exaiptasia diaphana, an emerging model
   sea anemone. Gene expression patterns showed that large parts of
   differentially expressed genes in response to heat stress were specific
   to the symbiotic state, suggesting that the host sea anemone could react
   to environmental changes in a symbiotic state-dependent manner.
   Comparative analysis of expression profiles under multiple conditions
   highlighted candidate genes potentially important in the symbiotic state
   transition under heat-induced bleaching. Many of these genes were
   functionally associated with carbohydrate and protein metabolisms in
   lysosomes. Symbiont algal genes differentially expressed in hospite
   encode proteins related to heat shock response, calcium signaling,
   organellar protein transport, and sugar metabolism. Our data suggest
   that heat stress alters gene expression in both the hosts and symbionts.
   In particular, heat stress may affect the lysosome-mediated degradation
   and transportation of substrates such as carbohydrates through the
   symbiosome (phagosome-derived organelle harboring symbiont) membrane,
   which potentially might attenuate the stability of symbiosis and lead to
   bleaching-associated symbiotic state transition.},

Abstract = {Cnidarians in symbiosis with photosynthetic protists must withstand
   daily hyperoxic/anoxic transitions within their host cells. Comparative
   studies between symbiotic (Anemonia viridis) and non-symbiotic (Actinia
   schmidti) sea anemones show striking dffferences in their response to
   oxidative stress. First, the basal expression of SOD is very different.
   Symbiotic animal cells have a higher isoform diversity (number and
   classes) and a higher activity than the non-symbiotic cells. Second, the
   symbiotic animal cells of A. viridis also maintain unaltered basal
   values for cellular damage when exposed to experimental hyperoxia (100\%
   O-2) or to experimental thermal stress (elevated temperature +7degreesC
   above ambient). Under such conditions, A. schmidti modifies its SOD
   activity significantly. Electrophoretic patterns diversify, global
   activities diminish and cell damage biomarkers increase. These data
   suggest symbiotic cells adapt to stress while non-symbiotic cells remain
   acutely sensitive. In addition to being toxic, high O-2 partial pressure
   P-O2) may also constitute a preconditioning step for symbiotic animal
   cells, leading to an adaptation to the hyperoxic condition and, thus, to
   oxidative stress. Furthermore, in aposymbiotic animal cells of A.
   viridis, repression of some animal SOD isoforms is observed. Meanwhile,
   in cultured symbionts, new activity bands are induced, suggesting that
   the host might protect its zooxanthellae in hospite. Similar results
   have been observed in other symbiotic organisms, such as the sea anemone
   Aiptasia pulchella and the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata.
   Molecular or physical interactions between the two symbiotic partners
   may explain such variations in SOD activity and might confer oxidative
   stress tolerance to the animal host.},

Title = {Diel fluctuations of mycosporine-like amino acids in shallow-water
   scleractinian corals},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {145},
Number = {5},
Pages = {863-873},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Reports of bathymetric decrease in the total mycosporine-like amino acid
   (MAA) concentration of benthic invertebrates suggest that light
   gradients may be important determinants of MAA content. With the
   pronounced diel light changes, distinct temporal variations in MAA
   concentrations might also be expected. We examined the changes in the
   abundance of MAA in three shallow-water scleractinian corals, Pavona
   divaricata, Galaxea fascicularis and Montipora digitata from Okinawa,
   Japan, in relation to daily cycles in solar radiation and tested whether
   the species have different capabilities for protection against UVR
   depending on their MAA composition. The results show that symbiotic
   algae freshly isolated from the investigated coral species do not
   contain MAAs and that distribution of these compounds resided only
   within the animal tissue. Total MAA content in the tissue of P.
   divaricata, G. fascicularis and M. digitata rose rapidly at midday and
   significantly dropped at night. The observed variations were by a factor
   of two and, thus, very dramatic. For all the investigated coral species,
   total MAA concentrations were significantly correlated with the diurnal
   cycle in solar radiation, during both winter and summer seasons.
   Seawater temperature was significantly correlated with MAA levels only
   in the June experiment, but represented no more than 20\% of the MAA
   variation in all three coral species, whereas solar radiation explained
   60-70\% of the MAA fluctuations. This suggests that MAAs are an integral
   component of the hard coral's biochemical defense system against high
   solar irradiance stress. The diurnal increase in total MAA
   concentrations was due to an increase in the concentration of imino-MAA
   species of up to 2-2.5-fold of their pre-dawn values. In contrast, the
   oxocarbonyl-MAA mycosporine-glycine (Myc-Gly) showed the lowest
   (Tukey-Kramer HSD test: P<0.05) values at midday, compared to afternoon
   and night hours. Analysis of diel changes in chlorophyll fluorescence
   and chlorophyll content of the investigated species revealed that P.
   divaricata and G. fascicularis were less sensitive to the high levels of
   ambient irradiance compared to M. digitata. In P. divaricata and G.
   fascicularis, Myc-Gly, an MAA with an antioxidant function, is the most
   abundant MAA, contributing about 70\% to the total MAA pool, whereas the
   major MAA factions in M. digitata were represented by oxidatively robust
   imino-MAAs. We speculate that MAAs furnish scleractinian corals with
   protection from biologically damaging ultraviolet radiation through both
   the direct sunscreening activity of imino-MAAs and the antioxidant
   properties of oxocarbonyl-MAAs and suggest that the predominance, in the
   host tissue, of MAA species with an antioxidant ability may render
   corals more tolerant to high photosynthetically active and ultraviolet
   radiation.},

Title = {A shift away from mutualism under food-deprived conditions in an
   anemone-dinoflagellate association},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 28},
Abstract = {The mutualistic symbiosis between anthozoans and intra-gastrodermal
   dinoflagellates of the family Symbiodiniaceae is the functional basis of
   all coral reef ecosystems, with the latter providing up to 95\% of their
   fixed photosynthate to their hosts in exchange for nutrients. However,
   recent studies of sponges, jellyfish, and anemones have revealed the
   potential for this mutualistic relationship to shift to parasitism under
   stressful conditions. Over a period of eight weeks, we compared the
   physiological conditions of both inoculated and aposymbiotic anemones
   (Exaiptasia pallida) that were either fed or starved. By the sixth week,
   both fed groups of anemones were significantly larger than their starved
   counterparts. Moreover, inoculated and starved anemones tended to
   disintegrate into ``tissue balls{''} within eight weeks, and 25\% of the
   samples died; in contrast, starved aposymbiotic anemones required six
   months to form tissue balls, and no anemones from this group died. Our
   results show that the dinoflagellates within inoculated anemones may
   have posed a fatal metabolic burden on their hosts during starvation;
   this may be because of the need to prioritize their own metabolism and
   nourishment at the expense of their hosts. Collectively, our study
   reveals the potential of this dynamic symbiotic association to shift
   away from mutualism during food-deprived conditions.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAR 13},
Abstract = {Despite being exposed to extreme water temperatures and solar
   irradiances, Red Sea corals are relatively resistant to bleaching. While
   their thermal tolerance is well described, little is known about their
   resistance to ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB). Here, we performed a
   short-term (2 days) UVB-removal incubation with Stylophora pistillata,
   and in situ measurements with Pocillopora verrucosa complemented by a
   long-term (46 days) transplantation and UVB-removal experiment. Using a
   suite of physiological parameters (effective quantum yield (F-v'/F-m'),
   oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation, LPO), and primary production), we
   assessed the impacts of UVB on the physiology and acclimation capacity
   of Red Sea corals. Shielding S. pistillata from UVB did not change the
   gross primary production or F-v'/F-m', and respiration and LPO in the
   host remained unaffected. In situ, P. verrucosa exhibited less varying
   and significantly higher F-v'/F-m' in 8 m depth (0.61 +/- 0.04) than in
   4 m (0.52 +/- 0.06), 2 m (0.51 +/- 0.09), and 0.5 m (0.50 +/- 0.11),
   where water temperatures ranged from 30.5-33.4, 30.6-34.0, 30.8-34.5,
   30.6-37.3 degrees C and daily UVB exposures averaged 0.9, 2.9, 11.8 and
   21.4 kJ m(-2), respectively. F-v'/F-m' correlated the strongest with UVB
   (-0.57), followed by PAR (-0.54) and temperature (-0.40), suggesting
   that UVB is a key determinant of photosynthetic efficiency. F-v'/F-m' of
   upward transplanted specimens (T 1m) was initially decreased but
   gradually increased and reached the same values as shallow corals (1 m)
   after 44 days. UVB removal significantly increased the F-v'/F-m' of
   transplanted corals in the first 20 days. Oxidative stress was initially
   highest in T 1m samples under full sunlight but equalized with 1 m
   specimens by day 46, whereas oxidative stress was significantly reduced
   by day 4 in T 1m corals sheltered from UVB. Overall, UVB-removal
   generally had little impact on the physiology of shallow-water S.
   pistillata and P. verrucosa but considerably accelerated the acclimation
   of upward transplanted corals. Our study highlights that UVB is a
   crucial stressor governing the photoacclimation capacity of these Red
   Sea coral species.},

Abstract = {Intertidal organisms commonly form zonation bands along the shore.
   Environmental stressors often determine the vertical position of each
   zonation band. These stressors may similarly affect the distribution
   pattern of endogenous species in their intertidal hosts. To evaluate
   this possibility, we investigated the distribution pattern of
   endosymbiotic zooxanthellae in the genus Symbiodinium in a population of
   the intertidal sea anemone Anthopleura uchidai. We used molecular
   genetics to identify the Symbiodinium clades and found that A. uchidai
   has two clades of Symbiodinium, clades A and F. These Symbiodinium
   clades were disproportionally distributed along the vertical gradient of
   the intertidal shore. Anemones on the upper shore exclusively possessed
   clade F Symbiodinium while clade A Symbiodinium became dominant in the
   sea anemones on the lower shore. Photosynthesis activity assays showed
   that these Symbiodinium clades had similar net productivities at 23.3
   and 31.8 A degrees C at all irradiance levels. At 35 A degrees C,
   however, clade A Symbiodinium exhibited substantially lower net
   productivities than clade F Symbiodinium, demonstrating that these
   Symbiodinium clades have distinct tolerances to thermal stress. These
   results suggest that the thermal gradient across tidal height is a major
   factor shaping the zonation pattern of Symbiodinium clades in A.

Title = {Physiological development of brooded larvae from two pocilloporid corals

Abstract = {In southern Taiwan, brooded larvae of Pocillopora damicornis and
   Seriatopora caliendrum are released year-round in synchrony with new
   moons, and each larval release occurs over multiple days. Using P.
   damicornis and S. caliendrum as a model system, we describe within-brood
   variation in larval phenotypes and test for release-day effects that
   influence larval performance in the pelagic phase. Research was
   conducted in 2010 using larvae from corals collected in June and July
   from Nanwan Bay (21A degrees 56.179'N, 120A degrees 44.85'E). In June,
   larval phenotypes of both species were characterized immediately
   following release, and their competency to settle assessed. In July,
   larvae of P. damicornis were collected on 3 days over the peak release
   period and incubated for 7-11 days at 28.0 A degrees C and 320 mu mol
   quanta m(-2) s(-1); their phenotypes and settlement competency were
   measured every 2 days. P. damicornis larvae released close to peak
   release were 1.6 times larger in size, contained twice the number of
   Symbiodinium larva(-1), and were 44 \% more likely to settle in the
   first 24 h than larvae released early in the brood. In addition,
   peak-release larvae respired at a lower rate than larvae released late
   in the brood. Similarly, S. caliendrum larvae released close to peak
   release were 1.4 times larger in size and were 33 \% more likely to
   settle in the first 5 h than larvae released early in the brood. In
   July, P. damicornis larvae differed between early (2 days prior to
   peak), peak, and late (2 days after peak) release. Protein content of
   early-release larvae was lower than peak- and late-release larvae, and
   this difference persisted throughout the development. Further, release
   day affected the way larval respiration varied throughout development.
   By showing that brooded coral larvae differ between release days and
   display maternal effects influencing performance in the swimming phase,
   our results suggest that pocilloporid corals utilize bet-hedging to
   increase reproductive success.},

   densities of reef-building corals in an isolated atoll, central South

Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {163},

Abstract = {The healthy status of corals in the isolated atolls of the central South
   China Sea (SCS) remains unclear. Symbiodiniaceae density (SD) can
   effectively reflect the thermal tolerance and health of hard corals.
   Here, the SDs of 238 samples from the Huangyan Atoll (HA) were analyzed.
   The results revealed significantly intergeneric and geomorphological
   differences in SD. Intergeneric variation may reflect that corals with
   high SD have stronger thermal tolerance. Geomorphic analysis showed that
   the SDs at the outer reef slope were higher than in the lagoon.
   Hydrodynamics and sea surface temperature were likely the main
   influencing factors. Most notably, corals in SCS HA had higher SDs than
   those at neighboring reefs, indicating that their thermal tolerance were
   strong, which may be related to HA' s local upwelling. These results
   suggest that the HA has the potential to serve as a refuge for corals,
   but increasing human disturbance limit its function.},

Title = {Response of zooxanthellae in symbiosis with the Mediterranean corals

Abstract = {Scleractinian symbiotic corals living in the Ligurian Sea (NW
   Mediterranean Sea) have experienced warm summers during the last decade,
   with temperatures rapidly increasing, within a few days, to 3-4 degrees
   C above the mean value of 24 degrees C. The effect of elevated
   temperatures on the photosynthetic efficiency of zooxanthellae in
   symbiosis with temperate corals has not been well investigated. In this
   study, the corals, Cladocora caespitosa and Oculina patagonica were
   collected in the Ligurian Sea (44 degrees N, 9 degrees E), maintained
   during 2 weeks at the mean summer temperature of 24 degrees C and then
   exposed during 48 h to temperatures of 24 (control), 27, 29 and 32
   degrees C. Chlorophyll (chl) fluorescence parameters {[}F-v/F-m,
   electron transport rate (ETR), non-photochemical quenching (NPQ)] were
   measured using pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorimetry before,
   during the thermal increase, and after 1 and 7 days of recovery (corals
   maintained at 24 degrees C). Zooxanthellae showed a broad tolerance to
   temperature increase, since their density remained unchanged and there
   was no significant reduction in their maximum quantum yield (F-v/F-m) or
   ETR up to 29 degrees C. This temperature corresponded to a 5 degrees C
   increase compared to the mean summer temperature (24 degrees C) in the
   Ligurian Sea. At 32 degrees C, there was a significant decrease in chl
   contents for both corals. This decrease was due to a reduction in the
   chl/zooxanthellae content. For C. caespitosa, there was also a decrease
   in ETRmax, not associated with a change in F-v/F-m or in the
   non-photochemical quenching (NPQ); for O. patagonica, both ETRmax and
   F-v/F-m significantly decreased, and NPQ(max) showed a significant
   increase. Damages to the photosystem II appeared to be reversible in
   both corals, since F-v/F-m values returned to normal after 1 day at 24
   degrees C. Zooxanthellae in symbiosis with the Mediterranean corals
   investigated can therefore be considered as resistant to short-term
   increases in temperature, even well above the maximum temperatures
   experienced by these corals in summer.},

Abstract = {Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) is now a well established
   analytical technique in geochemistry. Its developmental history goes
   back to the 1970s. Here, I tell the story of how I got involved in its
   applications to geochemistry in 1974 at the Institut de Physique du
   Globe in Paris (IPGP) with the Cameca IMS 300 instrument and my ensuing
   struggles with theories of secondary ion formation processes and the
   eventual development of the energy filtering approach as an effective
   method for suppressing molecular ion interferences in silicate minerals
   and glasses.
   The geochemical applications of the techniques that I developed with my
   colleagues at IPGP, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and
   Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) are summarised in four
   different categories: (1) trace element zoning of phenocrysts and the
   kinetics of magmatic crystallisation processes, (2) trace element
   abundance patterns and geochemical processes in the mantle, (3) use of
   trace element abundances in magmatic processes in the mid-ocean ridge
   system, and (4) use of Sr/Ca ratios in biogenic carbonates in
   palaeoceanographic studies. Trace element zoning patterns observed in
   phenocrysts reveal that crystal growth in magmas can occur with
   non-equilibrium partitioning of trace elements at the crystal-melt
   interface.
   Trace element zoning patterns in augite phenocrysts from Gough Island
   also indicate repeated drastic changes in magma composition, suggesting
   a turbulent dynamic state of magma bodies beneath eruptive centres.
   Chondrite normalised rare earth element (REE) patterns measured in
   clinopyroxenes from mantle rocks (peridotites from the Horoman massif
   and xenoliths in basalts from both oceanic and continental localities)
   show strong evidence for melt-rock reactions, indicating that
   lithospheric peridotites depleted in incompatible elements by melt
   extraction often show evidence of having been subsequently enriched in
   these elements through melt-rock reaction. The distribution of Sr in
   garnet inclusions in peridotitic diamonds from South Africa and Siberia
   is highly heterogeneous over wide concentration ranges, suggesting
   growth of inclusion garnets as well as formation of these diamonds,
   occurred shortly before the diamonds were carried to the surface by
   kimberlite eruptions.
   Rare earth element and other trace element abundance patterns measured
   in clinopyroxenes in abyssal peridotites clearly indicate that melting
   and melt extraction processes beneath mid-ocean ridges is akin to
   fractional melting by which small degree melt fractions are
   progressively extracted from residues as the mantle decompresses and
   only later mixed, sometimes incompletely, to form mid-ocean ridge basalt
   lavas erupted on the ocean floor. However, meltrock reactions between
   residual peridotites and upwelling melt fractions could significantly
   alter trace element abundance patterns of originally residual
   clinopyroxenes. In situ analyses reveal very large trace element
   variations occurring on intra-mineral scales, suggesting that
   precipitation of clinopyroxene also occurred during melt-rock reactions.
   It is evident that abyssal peridotites contain complex geochemical
   histories beyond melt extraction via fractional melting.
   Sr/Ca variations in coral skeletons (aragonite) reveal strong effects of
   photosynthesis of symbiont algae in day time growth zones, while those
   in night time growth zones near centres of calcification record
   variations of sea surface temperatures (SST) in Porites lutea. In
   Astrangia poculata, which experience a large temperature range (-2 -23
   degrees C), non-symbiotic skeletons faithfully record temperature
   variations, while symbiotic skeletons display ontogenic effects of algal
   symbionts. Sr/Ca variations in coccolithophores across the
   Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) display different responses of
   individual species to the sudden greenhouse environment, and the
   severity of the response also is dependent on the oceanographic
   conditions of their habitats.},

Abstract = {The proliferation of key marine ecological engineers and carbonate
   producers often relies on their association with photosymbiotic algae.
   Evaluating stress responses of these organisms is important to predict
   their fate under future climate projections. Physiological approaches
   are limited in their ability to resolve the involved molecular
   mechanisms and attribute stress effects to the host or symbiont, while
   probing and partitioning of proteins cannot be applied in organisms
   where the host and symbiont are small and cannot be physically
   separated. Here we apply a label-free quantitative proteomics approach
   to detect changes of proteome composition in the diatom-bearing benthic
   foraminifera Amphistegina gibbosa experimentally exposed to three
   thermal-stress scenarios. We developed a workflow for protein extraction
   from less than ten specimens and simultaneously analysed host and
   symbiont proteomes. Despite little genomic data for the host, 1,618
   proteins could be partially assembled and assigned. The proteomes
   revealed identical pattern of stress response among stress scenarios as
   that indicated by physiological measurements, but allowed identification
   of compartment-specific stress reactions. In the symbiont,
   stress-response and proteolysis-related proteins were up regulated while
   photosynthesis-related proteins declined. In contrast, host homeostasis
   was maintained through chaperone up-regulation associated with elevated
   proteosynthesis and proteolysis, and the host metabolism shifted to
   heterotrophy.},

Abstract = {Diurnal patterns of photoinhibition have been identified in seven
   species of shallow water reef corals from the Andaman Sea, off the west
   coast of Thailand, using pulse amplitude fluorometry. Photochemical
   efficiency (F-v/F-m) and quantum yield (Delta F/F-m') of symbiotic
   dinoflagellates within the corals declined after dawn to reach a minimum
   between midday and early afternoon, recovering to former dawn levels by
   early evening. Parallel studies on the xanthophylls diadinoxanthin (Dn)
   and diatoxanthin (Dt), and their inter-conversion, also revealed a
   strong diurnal pattern as well as inverse correlations between the
   xanthophyll ratio Dt/(Dn + Dt) and F-v/F-m and Delta F/F-m'. These
   findings suggest a photoprotective function for these pigments.},

Title = {Symbiont distribution along a light gradient within an intertidal cave},
Journal = {LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {50},
Number = {1},
Pages = {272-278},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The potentially lethal bleaching of invertebrates through loss of their
   algal symbionts is a major global conservation issue; cnidarians in such
   interactions could potentially withstand environmental change by having
   multiple symbiotic partners whose physiologies vary with critical field
   parameters such as temperature and light. Spatial variation in symbiont
   distributions in the field is a strong indicator of such potential. We
   show that, in an association between an abundant temperate sea anemone
   and its two endosymbionts, the dinophyte Symbiodinium muscatinei
   (zooxanthellae) and an unidentified green alga (zoochlorellae),
   densities and ratios of anemones' symbionts change along a light
   gradient generated by intertidal caves in Washington state. In the
   laboratory, the photosynthetic performance of zooxanthellate anemones
   exceeded that of zoochlorellate anemones under high irradiance levels
   (>100 tmol quanta m(-2) s(-1)). Further, field sampling revealed that
   caves are divided into three distinct regions based on anemones' algal
   complements: a brown region of zooxanthellate anemones near the mouth of
   the cave, a green region of zoochlorellate anemones in the middle of the
   cave, and a white region of algae-free anemones near the back of the
   cave. These data, together with field reciprocal transplant experiments
   showing algae-free anemones' ability to regrow algae consistent with
   local physical conditions, suggest that algal performance (vs. host
   selection) determines observed variation in these symbioses. Our results
   support the idea that temperate, as well as tropical, host-symbiont
   associations can respond plastically to environmental change. Our data
   also suggest that intact symbioses in adult hosts are surprisingly
   stable; bleaching may be required in rearranging host-symbiont
   associations.},

Title = {Bleaching reduces reproduction in the giant clam Tridacna gigas},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {706},
Pages = {47-56},
Month = {FEB 23},
Abstract = {Bleaching or the expulsion of the photosynthetic symbiont
   Symbiodiniaceae ('zooxanthellae') caused by the increase in seawater
   temperatures causes massive mortalities in giant clams. After a
   bleaching disturbance, population recovery is heavily dependent on
   reproduction and recruitment success. However, how bleaching directly
   affects the reproductive performance of giant clams is, to date,
   unknown. Here, we examined the direct impacts of bleaching on the
   reproduction of the giant clam Tridacna gigas between 2020 and 2021 in
   the Philippines. A continuous 6 mo monitoring of egg concentration, egg
   stage, egg size, recovery, and survival in prolonged bleached (moderate
   or severe) and non-bleached hatchery-bred T. gigas maintained in the
   wild was conducted. The probability of producing eggs and the proportion
   of intact eggs (developing and mature) were highest in healthy giant
   clams, followed by moderately bleached giant clams, and lowest in
   severely bleached giant clams in which >50\% individuals had empty
   gonads. The oocyte mean diameter was similar among giant clams,
   regardless of degree of bleaching. Only 5 severely bleached giant clams
   showed partial color recovery, whereas 2 healthy and 12 severely
   bleached giant clams died. This study shows that apart from the lethal
   effects of severe bleaching, the reproductive processes of surviving
   bleached T. gigas such as gametogenesis and egg production can be also
   negatively affected. Results suggest that the increasing frequency and
   intensity of bleaching due to thermal stress can lower the reproductive
   potential of giant clams and likely other zooxanthellate organisms,
   resulting in reduced recruitment and population decline.},

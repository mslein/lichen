Abstract = {{Here we report the first extensive validation study of laser removal of
   biodeteriogens from marble. The work was carried out on the Speranza,
   monumental sculpture of the 19th century placed inside the English
   Cemetery in Florence. The statue was covered by diffuse greenish and
   black-grayish species due to the biological growth, a mix of
   cyanobacteria, algae and fungi classified as biofilm. Optical
   microscopy, culture-based methods and CF-PAM imaging (Pulse Amplitude
   Modulated fluorometry of the Chlorophyll Fluorescence) were used to
   characterize the biodeteriogens. Laser technique was proposed as an
   efficient alternative for the traditional cleaning methodologies.
   Preliminary trials were performed using different wavelengths and pulse
   durations. The optimization of the laser parameters was performed
   considering the results obtained from the stratigraphic layers
   observations of the cross-sections of the stone material and real time
   CF-PAM imaging of the phototrophic presence.
   The study allowed improving, planning and accomplishing of the laser
   cleaning treatment of the whole statue. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to compare the physiological
   characteristics of various populations of the lichen Lobaria pulmonaria
   in Portugal and Sweden. For this, indirect markers of algal (photobiont)
   and fungal (mycobiont) activity were measured, as well as their CO2
   gasexchange characteristics. Microclimatic conditions and the lichens
   growth performance in the two countries were compared using reciprocal
   transplantation. Two populations of L. pulmonaria represented each
   country: one collected from forest interior conditions and one from
   forest edge habitats. A non-transplanted ``wild{''} population was also
   studied in each country, in order to evaluate any transplantation
   effects per se. The main hypothesis were that; 1) growth should be
   faster in Portugal due to higher light availability; 2) the energy use
   efficiency of lichen biomass gain should be similar for the native
   populations in their respective native habitat; 3) if the lichens were
   able to adapt to the environmental conditions in the foreign habitat
   this should be revealed as similar growth rates among all thalli
   transplanted at the same site, regardless of their origin.
   Physiologically, the Portuguese and Swedish populations were very
   similar, both concerning their CO2 gas exchange characteristics and
   distribution of resources between photo- and mycobiont tissue.
   Environmental conditions were more advantageous for L. pulmonaria growth
   in Portugal, i.e. higher photon flux densities and ambient temperatures
   when the lichens were wet and active, and a lower fraction of the active
   time occurring in darkness. However, despite similar physiological
   characteristics of all the studied populations, the Swedish lichens were
   not able to grow as well in Portugal as the native, while all
   populations had similarly low growth rates in Sweden.}},

Abstract = {{Ice-free regions in coastal areas of Victoria Land, Antarctica, are
   patchily distributed, limited in extent and characterized by a simple
   vegetation of lichens and mosses, growing only for a short period during
   the austral summer. These organisms are associated with soil particles
   and microorganisms (e.g., algae, microfungi and bacteria) to make up
   biological soil crusts (B5Cs), found worldwide in cold and/or arid and
   semi-arid regions, where plant growth is impaired. Despite B5Cs being
   among the most widespread ecosystems throughout coastal ice-free areas
   of continental Antarctica, fungal components of these communities have
   received little focus. Through ITS1 DNA metabarcoding of samples from 17
   sites of six different localities from 73 to 77 degrees S, in a distance
   scale from 29 to 411 km among different sites, we provide insights into
   the diversity, community composition, and functionality of fungal
   communities of these peculiar ecosystems, deepening our knowledge on how
   they are related to different edaphic variables (i.e. chemical
   properties and texture). Although fungal richness was low (59 +/- 27
   OTUs per sample), we found numerous previously unsequenced, putatively
   unknown fungal species representing a great part of the sampled
   communities. Community composition was spatially auto-correlated and
   appeared to be driven by site-specific differences in environmental
   conditions, particularly edaphic factors, such as exchangeable cations
   and pH. These results are of particular interest, as they give a wide
   characterization of the parameters determining soil colonization in a
   such limiting environment, especially in the light of global changes
   that are expected to deeply modify the conditions of this environment.

Abstract = {{The Eastern Wu tomb in Shangfang Town, Nanjing City is a brick tomb of

   environment monitoring was carried out and the effect of the current
   protective shed on the Eastern Wu tomb was examined. The hygrothermal
   transfer model of the protective shed was developed to evaluate the
   effects of the optimization of the protective shed for reducing the

Abstract = {{For biodiversity, natural afforestation is generally more favorable than
   plantation-based afforestation, but the difference may be less important
   if both methods fail to provide habitats for sensitive old-forest
   species. Given that some conditions, such as substrates, can be actively
   restored in new forests, their effect on biodiversity should be
   separated from dispersal limitation. We asked whether, and to what
   extent, lichen and bryophyte vegetation is impoverished on old-forest
   substrates in non-intensively afforested lands of the twentieth century
   compared with similar substrates in managed long-term forestlands. We
   measured the diversity and abundance of all lichens and bryophytes as
   well as the cover of human-sensitive (hemerophobic) species on large
   deciduous trees, logs, snags, and windthrows on 30 random 2-km transects
   in a 900-km(2) forest landscape in Estonia, hemiboreal Europe.
   Altogether, 235 species, including 39 hemerophobic species, were
   detected on 781 structural elements. New forests were not significantly
   worse than long-term forests in any of the cryptogam community
   characteristics, which was explained by the predominance of natural
   afforestation (many native tree species present), time for substrate
   development and cryptogam dispersal (most stands > 40 years old), few
   cuttings in the new forests (only about 20\% of stands thinned), and
   short distances to long-term forests (67\% of substrates within 250 m).
   Under such conditions, afforested areas appeared to be as suitable as
   traditional managed forests both for developing multifunctional forestry
   and as starting points for habitat restoration for threatened species.}},

   showed that net carbon exchange as well as ecosystem respiration were

   proportion of lichen cover (Cladina sp.) was not correlated with
   ecosystem carbon exchange. Clipping experiments showed that about half
   of the measured ecosystem respiration was heterotrophic. Plots that had

Abstract = {{Lichens hold water inside (internal pool) and outside their body
   (external pool). Yet, external pool size is not known in hair lichens
   dominating boreal forest canopies. Here we quantify morphological traits
   and internal/external water in two widespread Bryoria species along
   Picea abies canopy-height gradients: Bryoria fuscescens at 5-20 m and
   Bryoria capillaris at 15-20 m. Dry mass and specific thallus mass (STM)
   of intact B. fuscescens increased with height, while STM of individual
   branches did not. Maximum water holding capacity (mg H2O cm(-2))
   increased with height, but did not differ between the species. Bryoria
   had much larger external (79-84\% of total) than internal water pools,
   trapping water by dense clusters of thin, overlapping branches. They
   thus increase water storage in boreal forest canopies and influence
   hydrology. High external water storage extends hydration periods and
   improves lichen performance in upper canopies, and thereby contributes
   to the success of these hair lichens. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and British

   impacts of long-term temperature change and other environmental drivers
   from 1980 onwards. To disentangle different drivers, we related species'
   population trends to species-and driver-specific attributes, such as
   temperature and habitat preference or pollution tolerance. We found a
   consistent impact of temperature change on the local abundances of
   terrestrial species. Populations of warm-dwelling species increased more
   than those of cold-dwelling species. In contrast, impacts of temperature
   change on aquatic species' abundances were variable. Effects of
   temperature preference were more consistent in terrestrial communities
   than effects of habitat preference, suggesting that the impacts of
   temperature change have become widespread for recent changes in
   abundance within many terrestrial communities of central Europe.}},

Abstract = {{In this investigation, concentrations of 39 different inorganic elements

   different regions of four cities in Turkey were measured by energy
   dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WDXRF) spectrometry. Statistical

   of K, Ca and Br were found to differ significantly between L. hyalinus
   and L. minutus. In addition, Na, Mn and Fe concentrations for L.
   hyalinus and Ge for L. minutus were significantly different between
   males and females.
   As a result, there are statistically important differences in both
   compositions and amounts of the elements that are stored in the body of
   these two Laccophilus species and their sexes. The difference in
   compositions may result from the metabolic activity in the sexes, and
   between the two species. But it must be also considered that the
   differences of element content and composition of insect bodies depend
   on the element content of their habitats. From our results, knowledge
   about the element composition of an area is easily obtained by making an
   analysis of the elements of the bodies of the insects, specifically
   dominant predators like Laccophilus species. In addition, we suggest
   that it is possible to refine the wastes which contain some heavy
   metals, by using water insects as well as Laccophilus species. We also
   hypothesize that Sri and Sr elements can have a role in beetle
   metabolism, since the elements could be determined in these two species
   collected in most of the habitats. But there is a need for biochemical
   studies to find out what roles the elements play in the bodies.}},

Title = {{A test of physical limitation to specific substrata during establishment
   for Didymodon johansenii, a rare moss}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BRYOLOGY}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{197-206}},
Abstract = {{The rare moss, Didymodon johansenii, occurs only on substrata with a
   fine layer of calcareous silt. In Alberta, these substrata are mainly
   logs and tree bases. Such substratum specificity patterns may relate to
   species interactions with the substratum itself, with other species, or
   a combination. Direct species-substratum interactions are most crucial
   during the establishment stage, and may be either physiologically or
   physically based, with physical limitations pertaining to substrata such
   as rocks or logs where it is difficult for propagules to attach.
   Substratum specificity of D. johansenii was quantified through logistic
   regression analysis of log characteristics. Didymodon johansenii has a
   higher probability of occurrence on logs with a silt layer, high
   bryophyte species richness (at least four other species) and in later
   decay stages. Logs with this combination of characteristics were termed
   `suitable'. `Unsuitable' logs are those in early decay stages, with no
   silt layer and low species diversity. When environmental variables were
   compared for these log groups, suitable and unsuitable logs did not
   differ significantly in terms of ambient light or temperature, but water
   stress was lower on suitable logs. Regeneration from gametophyte
   fragments was tested on suitable and unsuitable logs in plots with and
   without a silt layer. Silt was the most important factor influencing the
   number of fragments alive at the end of the study. Sprouting of
   fragments was positively related to both the silt application and the
   number of fragments alive at collection time. Differences in
   environmental conditions on logs did not relate to fragment performance.
   In Alberta, the relationship between D. johansenii's rarity and
   substratum limitation is confirmed and the mechanism for this
   restriction is principally physical adherence of fragments to substratum
   during establishment. Silt also may have long-term effects on the moss
   species' growth rate that could relate to its competitive and
   reproductive capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of air drying and hypertonic treatments in the dark on seven
   bryophytes, which had grown under different water environments, were
   studied. All the desiccation-tolerant species tested lost most of their
   PSII photochemical activity when photosynthetic electron transport was
   inhibited by air drying, while, in all the sensitive species, the PSII
   photochemical activity remained at a high level even when photosynthesis
   was totally inhibited. The PSI reaction center remained active under
   drying conditions in both sensitive and tolerant species, but the
   activity became non-detectable in the light only in tolerant species due
   to deactivation of the cyclic electron flow around PSI and of the back
   reaction in PSI. Light-induced non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) was
   found to be induced not only by the xanthophyll cycle but also by a
   pH-induced, dithiothreitol-insensitive mechanism in both the
   desiccation-tolerant and -intolerant bryophytes. Both mechanisms are
   thought to have an important role in protecting desiccation-tolerant
   species from photoinhibition under drying conditions. Fluorescence
   emission spectra at 77K showed that dehydration-induced quenching of
   PSII fluorescence was observed only in tolerant species and was due to
   neither state 1state 2 transition nor detachment of light-harvesting
   chlorophyll protein complexes from PSII core complexes.The presence of
   dehydration-induced quenching of PSI fluorescence was also suggested.}},

Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{Links between water and carbon (C) cycles in drylands are strongly
   regulated by biocrusts. These widespread communities in the intershrub
   spaces of drylands are able to use non-rainfall water inputs (NRWI)
   (fog, dewfall and water vapour) to become active and fix carbon dioxide
   (CO2), converting biocrusts into the main soil C contributors during
   periods in which vegetation remains inactive. In this study, we first
   evaluated the influence of biocrust type on NRWI uptake using automated
   microlysimeters, and second, we performed an outdoor experiment to
   examine how NRWI affected C exchange (photosynthesis and respiration) in
   biocrusts. NRWI uptake increased from incipient cyanobacteria to
   well-developed cyanobacteria and lichen biocrusts. NRWI triggered
   biocrust activity but with contrasting effects on CO2 fluxes depending
   on the main NRWI source. Fog mainly stimulated respiration of
   biocrust-covered soils, reaching net CO2 emissions of 0.68 mu mol m(-2)
   s(-1), while dew had a greater effect stimulating biocrust
   photosynthesis and resulted in net CO2 uptake of 0.66 mu mol m(-2)
   s(-1). These findings demonstrate the key role that NRWI play in
   biocrust activity and the soil C balance in drylands. (C) 2021 Elsevier

Abstract = {{AimTo quantify changes in vegetation productivity over the past three
   decades across five barren ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus
   groenlandicus) herd ranges and assess how these changes are influencing
   caribou movement rates.
   LocationNorthwest Territories and Nunavut, Canada.
   MethodsAs an indicator of vegetation productivity, the enhanced
   vegetation index (EVI) was calculated on newly developed cloud-free,
   gap-free, Landsat surface reflectance image composites representing
   1984-2012. Changes in EVI were assessed on a pixel basis using
   Theil-Sen's nonparametric regression and compared across herd ranges and
   land cover types using generalized least squares regression. Animal
   movement velocity was calculated from caribou telemetry data and
   generalized additive mixed models were used to link movement rates with
   vegetation productivity during the post-calving phase of the year (July
   and August).
   ResultsVegetation productivity increased across the five caribou herd
   ranges examined. The largest productivity increase occurred over the
   ranges of the most western herds, with the largest observed changes in
   grassland or shrub habitats. Caribou tended to move more slowly through
   tundra habitats with elevated levels of productivity to a point, while
   grasslands movement rates decreased linearly with increasing
   productivity. Movement velocities peaked at intermediate productivity
   levels in shrub habitats.
   Main conclusionsOver the three decades of collected data, barren ground
   caribou habitats have become more productive, which is consistent with
   other studies that have documented increases in Arctic vegetation
   productivity. The more western herds, whose ranges are also closest to
   the Arctic Ocean, experienced the largest increases in productivity.
   Finally, we demonstrate that barren ground caribou movement patterns
   will likely change as a result of changing vegetation productivity in
   complex manners depending on herd, habitat type and the magnitude of
   change in vegetation productivity.}},

   and we used multiple (meta- and beta-) regression to test whether and
   how climate, forest composition and age and topography influence forest
   moss layer cover at broad spatial scales. Results Main conclusions
   Forest moss cover increased towards the North along a clear latitudinal
   gradient by c. 2\% per 1 degrees of latitude, and it decreased with
   increasing maximum temperature by c. 1\%-5\% per 1 degrees C. Thus, cool
   northern regions (e.g., northern Europe) can be considered forest moss
   layer hotspots. Moss layer cover was driven mainly by canopy composition
   when all potential drivers were considered. Compared with broad-scale
   systematic surveys, the data from specialized literature overestimated
   moss cover in broadleaf deciduous forests where moss cover was low and
   variable. Our findings highlight that systematic surveys complement
   specialized literature in accurately modelling abundance on broad
   scales. Given that temperature, rather than precipitation or
   seasonality, limited the abundance of forest moss layer on broad scales,
   the moss layer might be a promising tool for monitoring forest ecosystem
   responses to climate warming.}},

   O-3). In the laboratory, Kautsky curves were induced under standardized
   conditions at species-specific PPFD values before exposure, after 6
   weeks and at the end of the exposure. Significant decrease in F-v/F-m
   was only observed in P. perlatum transplants exposed in B. possibly as a
   consequence of the dry conditions of that site. Non-photochemical
   quenching (NPQ) was negatively affected in all three species, although
   with different intensity, in both urban sites, but more intensively in C
   than in B. Chl(a)F data shows clearly that (i) the decrease of NPQ was
   modulated by time exposure to NOx as well as by NOx concentration, and
   (ii) the species response to pollutants was related to species ecology:

Abstract = {{Although lichenized fungi are among the most reliable indicators of
   forest quality and represent a considerable part of forest biodiversity,
   methods maximizing completeness of their species lists per area are
   lacking. Employing a novel methodological approach including a
   multi-expert competition and a search for local hot-spot plots, we have
   obtained outstanding data about epiphytic lichen biota in a part of the
   largest Central European virgin forest reserve Uholka-Shyrokyi Luh
   situated in Ukrainian Carpathians. Our field research consisted of two
   four-day periods: (1) an overall floristic survey and a search for spots
   with raised lichen diversity, and (2) survey in four one-hectare plots
   established in lichen diversity hot-spots along an altitudinal gradient.
   Recorded alpha-diversities in plots ranged from 181-228 species, but
   estimated species richness is in the range 207-322 species. Detected
   gamma-diversity was 387 species; estimates are 409-484 species. 93\% of
   the species found in the forest were recorded in plots, but only 65\%
   outside the plots. This underlines the high-efficiency of the
   multi-expert competitive survey in diversity hot-spot plots. Species
   richness in each one-hectare plot was equal to the numbers of species
   obtained by floristic surveys of much larger old-growth forest areas in
   Central Europe. Gamma-diversity detected in the Uholka primeval forest
   far exceeded all numbers achieved in Central European old-growth
   forests. Our method appears to be both effective (it obtains a more
   nearly complete inventory of species) and practical (the resources
   required are not unreasonably large).}},

Abstract = {{Less intensive harvesting methods (e.g., selection cutting, shelterwood
   cuttings) are recommended as alternatives to clearcutting for
   maintaining mature forest biodiversity in the process of forest
   regeneration. However, the long-term impact of low-intensity harvesting
   methods has rarely been studied. Our aim was to clarify the long-term
   effects of repeated selective cutting, thinning, and shelterwood cutting
   on the richness, abundance, and species composition of vascular plants,
   bryophytes, and lichens in Scots pine forests (Pinus sylvestris L.).
   Data were collected from 25 mature stands located in dry Podzols in
   southwestern Estonia with a known management history for the last 70
   years. Altogether, 35 vascular plant, 41 bryophyte, and 78 lichen
   species were recorded, including five species with conservational value.
   Generally, the management history was not related to species richness,
   except a negative correlation with the species number of epiphytic
   lichens on conifer trees. In addition, the abundance of two lichen
   species from the genus Chuenothecu was lower in more frequently managed
   stands. Species richness and composition were most strongly affected by
   soil pH and light conditions. We conclude that long-term, low-intensity
   harvesting of Scots pine forests on nutrient-poor Podzols maintains
   suitable habitats for vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens,
   confirming its suitability for sustainable forest regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to investigate differences in plant species
   composition between managed and unmanaged forests, and to assess if
   these difference give rise to a higher plant diversity in the unmanaged
   forest. Furthermore our aim is to relate forest structure to differences
   in plant species composition, identifying the structural attributes more
   strongly related to the unmanaged forest vegetation. We compared an
   old-growth forest and a managed highforest in the Abruzzo Lazio and
   Molise National Park (Central Italy). Plant species composition and
   diversity, deadwood components and live structure have been analyzed. We
   used permutational multivariate analysis of variance to test the
   response of species composition to management factor; furthermore, we
   compared species richness and beta diversity. Redundancy analysis has
   been used to relate plant species abundances to structural variables;
   the importance of dead and living wood components has been compared
   through variation partitioning. Plant species composition proved to be
   significantly different in the two sites, and the old-growth stand
   showed a higher plant diversity. From a structural point of view, we
   found differences especially in the amount and quality of deadwood, and
   in the diameter class distribution. These variables are also the most
   important in determining the old-growth stand plant species composition
   according to redundancy analysis. Variation partitioning confirmed the
   greater importance of the deadwood variables. Our results suggest that
   including deadwood surveys in traditional forest inventories could help
   in finding forests with both structural and floristic old-growth
   properties to be considered in conservation programmes. The imitation of
   natural dynamics, through the creation of gaps avoiding deadwood
   removal, could be an effective strategy for restoring old-growth
   conditions, also in terms of plant diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Exotic winter annual grasses (Bromus spp.) are a problem in North

   regulate invasive annual Bromus species. We conducted a field experiment
   that tested effects of mechanical mowing and fungicide applications on
   Bromus arvensis, other and total graminoids, forbs, litter, and moss.
   Treatments caused litter biomass and moss cover to vary, which enabled
   testing whether litter and mosses explain variation in B. arvensis
   biomass. Two yr after cessation of experimental treatments, mowing
   treatments caused persistent reductions in B. arvensis, total graminoid,
   and litter biomasses but had no effect on other graminoid and forb
   biomasses. We detected a positive relationship between litter and B.
   arvensis. Fungicide applications increased moss cover and other and
   total graminoid biomasses, thereby suggesting mosses and several
   graminoids were released from the suppressive effects of biota (e.g.,
   lichen, pathogenic fungi) susceptible to the fungicide. We found no
   relationship, however, between moss cover and B. arvensis. In temperate

   mass-spectrometer disequilibrium technique was used to quantify fluxes
   of both HCO3- and CO2 in the two algae, while activities of carbonic
   anhydrases (CAs) were examined in intact cells by measuring O-18
   exchange from doubly labelled CO2 ((COO)-C-13-O-18-O-18) to water and by
   using CA inhibitors. The CO2-fixation kinetics of intact Coccomyxa cells
   were also compared with the carboxylation efficiency of its isolated and
   purified primary carboxylating enzyme, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
   carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco). The two algae were found to be
   significantly different in their modes of acquiring CO2 for
   photosynthesis. Chlamydomonas was able to actively transport both HCO3-
   and CO2 from the external medium, while Coccomyxa clearly favoured CO2
   as a substrate. Both algae were found to possess external as well as
   internal CAs, but the relative amounts of these as well as their overall
   significance for the functioning of photosynthesis differed. In
   Coccomyxa, the internal CA activity was significantly higher than in
   Chlamydomonas and also predominated over the external activity. In
   Chlamydomonas, both transport and fixation of DIC were severely
   inhibited by ethoxyzolamide, an inhibitor of external and internal CAs
   as well as the DIG-transporting system, while this inhibitor only caused
   a minor inhibition of photosynthesis in Coccomyxa. These results thus
   give strong support for earlier indirect observations of the absence of
   a CO2-concentrating mechanism in Coccomyxa. In addition, Coccomyxa was
   found to possess a Rubisco with a higher carboxylation efficiency than
   Chlamydomonas, having a Km(CO2) of 12 +/- 3 mu M CO2 and a CO2/O-2
   specificity factor (S-c/o) of 83 +/- 2, and it may hence be concluded
   that the absence of the CO2-concentrating mechanism is positively
   correlated with a more efficient Rubisco in this alga.}},

Abstract = {{Keystone mutualisms, such as corals, lichens or mycorrhizae, sustain
   fundamental ecosystem functions. Range dynamics of these symbioses are,
   however, inherently difficult to predict because host species may switch
   between different symbiont partners in different environments, thereby
   altering the range of the mutualism as a functional unit. Biogeographic
   models of mutualisms thus have to consider both the ecological
   amplitudes of various symbiont partners and the abiotic conditions that
   trigger symbiont replacement. To address this challenge, we here
   investigate `symbiont turnover zones'--defined as demarcated regions
   where symbiont replacement is most likely to occur, as indicated by
   overlapping abundances of symbiont ecotypes. Mapping the distribution of
   algal symbionts from two species of lichen-forming fungi along four
   independent altitudinal gradients, we detected an abrupt and consistent
   beta-diversity turnover suggesting parallel niche partitioning.
   Modelling contrasting environmental response functions obtained from
   latitudinal distributions of algal ecotypes consistently predicted a
   confined altitudinal turnover zone. In all gradients this symbiont
   turnover zone is characterized by approximately 12 degrees C average
   annual temperature and approximately 5 degrees C mean temperature of the
   coldest quarter, marking the transition from Mediterranean to cool
   temperate bioregions. Integrating the conditions of symbiont turnover
   into biogeographic models of mutualisms is an important step towards a
   comprehensive understanding of biodiversity dynamics under ongoing
   environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{Water loss has significant effects on physiological performance and
   survival rates of algae. However, despite the prominent presence of
   aeroterrestrial algae in terrestrial habitats, hardly anything is known
   about the molecular events that allow aeroterrestrial algae to survive
   harsh environmental conditions. We analyzed the transcriptome and
   physiology of a strain of the alpine aeroterrestrial alga Klebsormidium
   crenulatum under control and strong desiccation-stress conditions.
   Principal Findings: For comparison we first established a reference
   transcriptome. The high-coverage reference transcriptome includes about
   24,183 sequences (1.5 million reads, 636 million bases). The reference
   transcriptome encodes for all major pathways (energy, carbohydrates,
   lipids, amino acids, sugars), nearly all deduced pathways are complete
   or missing only a few transcripts. Upon strong desiccation, more than
   7000 transcripts showed changes in their expression levels. Most of the
   highest up-regulated transcripts do not show similarity to known
   viridiplant proteins, suggesting the existence of some genus-or
   species-specific responses to desiccation. In addition, we observed the
   up-regulation of many transcripts involved in desiccation tolerance in
   plants (e.g. proteins similar to those that are abundant in late
   embryogenesis (LEA), or proteins involved in early response to
   desiccation ERD), and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the
   raffinose family of oligosaccharides (RFO) known to act as osmolytes).
   Major physiological shifts are the up-regulation of transcripts for
   photosynthesis, energy production, and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
   metabolism, which is supported by elevated cellular glutathione content
   as revealed by immunoelectron microscopy as well as an increase in total
   antiradical power. However, the effective quantum yield of Photosystem
   II and CO2 fixation decreased sharply under the applied desiccation
   stress. In contrast, transcripts for cell integrative functions such as
   cell division, DNA replication, cofactor biosynthesis, and amino acid
   biosynthesis were down-regulated.
   Significance: This is the first study investigating the desiccation
   transcriptome of a streptophyte green alga. Our results indicate that
   the cellular response is similar to embryophytes, suggesting that
   embryophytes inherited a basic cellular desiccation tolerance from their
   streptophyte predecessors.}},

Abstract = {{Model systems have had a profound influence on the development of
   ecological theory and general principles. Compared to alternatives, the
   most effective models share some combination of the following
   characteristics: simpler, smaller, faster, general, idiosyncratic or
   manipulable. We argue that biological soil crusts (biocrusts) have
   unique combinations of these features that should be more widely
   exploited in community, landscape and ecosystem ecology. In community
   ecology, biocrusts are elucidating the importance of biodiversity and
   spatial pattern for maintaining ecosystem multifunctionality due to
   their manipulability in experiments. Due to idiosyncrasies in their
   modes of facilitation and competition, biocrusts have led to new models
   on the interplay between environmental stress and biotic interactions
   and on the maintenance of biodiversity by competitive processes.
   Biocrusts are perhaps one of the best examples of micro-landscapes-real
   landscapes that are small in size. Although they exhibit varying patch
   heterogeneity, aggregation, connectivity and fragmentation, like
   macro-landscapes, they are also compatible with well-replicated
   experiments (unlike macro-landscapes). In ecosystem ecology, a number of
   studies are imposing small-scale, low cost manipulations of global
   change or state factors in biocrust micro-landscapes. The versatility of
   biocrusts to inform such disparate lines of inquiry suggests that they
   are an especially useful model system that can enable researchers to see
   ecological principles more clearly and quickly.}},

Abstract = {{Antarctic plants are stable specific microenvironments for microbial
   colonization that are still less explored. In this study, we
   investigated cultivable heterotrophic bacteria and yeasts dominating in
   plant samples collected from different terrestrial biotopes near
   Ukrainian Antarctic Base on Galindez Island, maritime Antarctica.
   Phylogenetic analysis revealed affiliation of the bacterial isolates to
   genera Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Brevundimonas, Sporosarcina,
   Dermacoccus, Microbacterium, Rothia and Frondihabitans, and the yeast
   isolates to genera Rhodosporidium, Cryptococcus, Leucosporidiella,
   Candida and Exophiala. Some ecophysiological properties of isolated
   strains were determined that are important in response to different
   stresses such as psychro- and halotolerance, UV-resistance and
   production of hydrolytic enzymes. The majority of isolates (88 \%) was
   found to be psychrotolerant; all are halotolerant. Significant
   differences in survival subsequent to UV-C radiation were observed among
   the isolates, as measured by culturable counts. For the bacterial
   isolates, lethal doses in the range 80-600 J m(-2) were determined, and
   for the yeast isolates-in the range 300-1,000 J m(-2). Dermacoccus
   profundi U9 and Candida davisiana U6 were found as most UV resistant
   among the bacterial and yeast isolates, respectively. Producers of
   caseinase, gelatinase, beta-glucosidase, and cellulase were detected. To
   the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on isolation of UV
   resistant strain D. profundi, and Frondihabitans strain from Antarctica,
   and on detection of cellulase activity in Antarctic yeast strain C.
   davisiana. The results obtained contribute to clarifying adaptation
   strategies of Antarctic microbiota and its possible role in functional
   stability of Antarctic biocenoses. Stress tolerant strains were detected
   that are valuable for ecological and applied studies.}},

Abstract = {{Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) occur widely in the uppermost

   Heterotrophic protists in soil are predominantly bacterivores, and
   because of their high biomass compared with other soil fauna and fast

   nutrient cycling and energy fluxes. Thus, knowledge of their
   biodiversity, abundance and functional roles is important to understand
   soil ecosystem functions. We investigated the diversity and abundance of
   heterotrophic soil protists in different types of biocrusts from the
   Succulent Karoo, South Africa. With an overall diversity of 23 distinct

Abstract = {{Polar biodiversity should be monitored as an indicator of climate

   study has two objectives. The first is constructing a first-ever
   vegetation map of the entire Barton Peninsula, Antarctica. The second is
   developing a monitoring method for long-term variation of vegetation,
   based on satellite images. Dominant mosses and lichens are distributed
   in small and sparse patches, which are limited to analysis using
   high-resolution satellite images. A sub-pixel classification method,
   spectral mixture analysis, is applied to overcome limited spatial
   resolution. As a result, vegetation shows high abundance along the
   southeastern shore and low-to-medium abundance in the nearly snow-free
   inland area. Even though spatial patterns of vegetation were almost
   invariant over 6 years, there was interannual variation in abundance
   aspects because of meteorological conditions. Therefore, extensive and
   long-term monitoring is needed for aspects of distribution and

Abstract = {{In many polar and alpine ecosystems, lichens of genus Umbilicaria
   represent dominant species forming community structure. Photosynthetic
   and spectral properties of the lichens may change rapidly according to
   an actual hydration status of their thalli. In this study, we
   investigated responses of photochemical reflectance index (PRI),
   normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), effective quantum yield
   of photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem (PS) II (I broken vertical
   bar(PSII)), and several photosynthetic parameters derived from fast
   induction kinetics of chlorophyll fluorescence (OJIP) to controlled
   dehydration. We used U. arctica and U. hyperborea collected close to
   Nuuk, Greenland. In both the species, PRI showed a curvilinear increase
   with dehydration, i.e., a decreasing water potential (I-w). The increase
   was apparent within I-w range of 0 to -10 MPa. The PRI increase was less
   pronounced in U. arctica than in U. hyperborea. NDVI decreased with a
   progressive thallus dehydration in both the species, however, throughout
   I-w range of 0 to -30 MPa, U. hyperborea had lower NDVI values than U.
   arctica. The relationship between I broken vertical bar(PSII) and I-w
   resulted in a typical S curve. A critical I-w at which photosynthetic
   processes were fully inhibited was -30 MPa in both the species, however,
   species-specific differences in the S curve shape were found. Analyses
   of photosynthetic parameters derived from OJIPs revealed that the
   absorption of radiation energy and a trapping rate increased with
   dehydration in active reaction centres of PS II, the number of which
   decreased with a more pronounced lichen thallus dehydration. It is
   concluded that U. arctica and U. hyperborea possess effective
   physiological mechanisms to maintain an effective photosynthesis when
   partly dehydrated (the I-w range of 0 to -15 MPa). In spite of similar
   ecological niches that these two lichens occupy in nature, their

Abstract = {{Pain in the oro-facial region is one of the most common reasons for
   patients to seek dental treatment. Oral health-related quality of life
   (OHRQoL) can be affected not only by pain, but also by other oral
   disorders. Four main dimensions, Oral Function, Orofacial Pain,
   Orofacial Appearance and Psychosocial Impact, have been suggested to
   cover different areas of OHRQoL. The aim of this systematic review was
   to map the impact of oro-facial pain conditions on the Orofacial Pain
   dimension of OHRQoL (PROSPERO registration: CRD42017064033). Studies
   were included if they reported Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP) mean or
   median domain scores for patients with odontogenic pain, oral mucosal
   pain/burning mouth syndrome (BMS), third molar extractions or
   temporomandibular disorders (TMD). A search in PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE,
   Cochrane, CINAHL and PsycINFO on 8 June 2017, updated 14 January 2019,
   combined with a hand search identified 2104 articles. After screening of
   abstracts, 1607 articles were reviewed in full text and 36 articles were
   included that reported OHIP data for 44 patient populations including
   5849 patients. Typical Orofacial Pain impact for all four conditions
   (odontogenic pain, oral mucosal pain/BMS, pain after third molar
   extractions and TMD) was between 2 and 3 on a 0-8 converted OHIP scale
   with the highest reported impact for pain after 3rd molar extractions.
   This review provides standardised information about OHRQoL impact from

Abstract = {{1. The surface layer of soil as transition zone between pedosphere and
   atmosphere plays a crucial role in exchange processes of nutrients,
   atmospheric gases and water. Knowledge of its water content is
   essential, as it governs both physiological and transport mechanisms. In
   arid and semi-arid regions, this uppermost soil layer is commonly
   colonized by biological soil crusts (biocrusts), which play major roles
   in the global terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycles. The water status
   of biocrusts is essential as it controls the activity, productivity and
   surface exchange of these poikilohydric communities. On-site analyses of
   the water content of both bare and crusted soils are thus urgently
   needed to correctly model the exchange processes of water, nutrients and
   trace gases at the soil surface.
   2. In this study, we present the biocrust wetness probe (BWP), which is
   the first to reliably measure the water content within biocrusts or the
   uppermost 5 mm of a substrate. Using a weak alternating current, the
   electrical conductivity is assessed over time. With an automatic
   calibration routine, conductivity values are temperature-corrected and
   converted into water contents and precipitation equivalents.
   3. During 1 year of continuous field measurements at 5-min intervals, 60
   BWPs worked reliably without any failure. The probes responded
   immediately and individually upon rain events, showing
   substrate-specific water response curves, which are well represented by
   linear and exponential calibration curves.
   4. The BWP facilitates the spatio-temporal assessment and interpolation
   of surface soil wetness and thus biocrust activity, which governs
   nutrient fluxes, trace gas release and biogeochemical cycles. Its
   implementation in distributed sensor networks is under development.}},

Abstract = {{Prehistoric rock art sites are endangered despite conservation efforts.
   The lack of scientific documentation regarding weathering agents
   affecting rock art and the absence of specific diagnostic protocols
   hinder the development of conservation strategies. The aim of this
   research was to investigate active deterioration processes in a granite
   petroglyph site located in Mougas (Galicia, NW Spain) by characterizing
   the granite, conducting a geotechnical study of the outcrop and
   describing and analysing the main weathering processes. Two main
   deterioration factors were identified. First, water favours block
   disjunction at the massif scale and causes pitting and surface erosion
   at the millimetre scale that affects the readability of the engravings.
   Second, high temperatures associated with wildfires cause mineral
   transformations that increase the susceptibility of the rock to
   weathering. Identifying deterioration factors is a first step in
   developing appropriate preventive conservation measures, which should
   aim to reduce rock contact time with water (technically affordable in
   the short term) and to reduce the probability of wildfire occurrence
   (technically more complex and possibly with longer-term results).

   sources. This study aims to compare the metal accumulation capabilities
   of mosses and vascular species in urban areas and quantify the
   suitability of different taxa for monitoring airborne heavy metals. One
   pleurocarpous feather moss species, Haplocladium angustifolium, and two
   evergreen tree species, Cinnamomum bodinieriOsmanthus fragrans, and
   substrate soil were sampled in the urban area of different land use
   types in Wuhan City in China. The concentrations of Ag, As, Cd, Co, Cr,
   Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, V, Pb, and Zn in these samples were analyzed by
   inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The differences of heavy
   metals concentration in the three species showed that the moss species
   was considerably more capable of accumulating heavy metals than tree
   leaves (3 times to 51 times). The accumulated concentration of heavy
   metals in the moss species depended on the metal species and land use
   type. The enrichment factors of metals for plants and the correlations
   of metals in plants with corresponding metals in soil reflected that the
   accumulated metals in plants stemmed mostly from atmospheric deposition,
   rather than the substrate soil. Anthropogenic factors, such as traffic
   emissions from automobile transportation and manufacturing industries,
   were primarily responsible for the variations in metal pollutants in the
   atmosphere and subsequently influenced the metal accumulation in the
   mosses. This study elucidated that the moss species H. angustifolium is
   relatively more suitable than tree leaves of C. bodinieri and O.
   fragrans in monitoring heavy metal pollution in urban areas, and
   currently Wuhan is at a lower contamination level of atmospheric heavy
   metals than some other cities in China.}},

Abstract = {{Fluctuations of the Charquini glaciers (Cordillera Real, Bolivia) have
   been reconstructed for the Little Ice Age (LIA) from a set of 10
   moraines extending below the present glacier termini. A lichenometric
   method using the Rhizocarpon geographicum was used to date the moraines
   and reconstruct the main glacier fluctuations over the period. The
   maximum glacier extent occurred in the second half of the 17th century,
   followed by nearly continuous retreat with three interruptions during
   the 18th and the 19th centuries, marked by stabilisation or minor
   advances. Results obtained in the Charquini area are first compared with
   other dating performed in the Peruvian Cordillera Blanca and then with
   the fluctuations of documented glaciers in the Northern Hemisphere.
   Glacier fluctuations along the tropical Andes (Bolivia and Peru) were in
   phase during the LIA and the solar forcing appears to be important
   during the period of glacier advance. Compared with the Northern
   Hemisphere mid-latitudes, the major advance observed on these glaciers
   during the first half of the 19th century is not present in the tropical
   Andes. This discrepancy may be due to regional scale climate variations.

Title = {{Species-specific effects of passive warming in an Antarctic moss system}},
Journal = {{ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Polar systems are experiencing rapid climate change and the high
   sensitivity of these Arctic and Antarctic ecosystems make them
   especially vulnerable to accelerated ecological transformation. In
   Antarctica, warming results in a mosaic of ice-free terrestrial habitats
   dominated by a diverse assemblage of cryptogamic plants (i.e. mosses and
   lichens). Although these plants provide key habitat for a wide array of
   microorganisms and invertebrates, we have little understanding of the
   interaction between trophic levels in this terrestrial ecosystem and
   whether there are functional effects of plant species on higher trophic
   levels that may alter with warming. Here, we used open top chambers on
   Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica, to examine the effects
   of passive warming and moss species on the abiotic environment and
   ultimately on higher trophic levels. For the dominant mosses,
   Polytrichastrum alpinum and Sanionia georgicouncinata, we found
   species-specific effects on the abiotic environment, including moss
   canopy temperature and soil moisture. In addition, we found distinct
   shifts in sexual expression in P. alpinum plants under warming compared
   to mosses without warming, and invertebrate communities in this moss
   species were strongly correlated with plant reproduction. Mosses under
   warming had substantially larger total invertebrate communities, and
   some invertebrate taxa were influenced differentially by moss species.
   However, warmed moss plants showed lower fungal biomass than control
   moss plants, and fungal biomass differed between moss species. Our
   results indicate that continued warming may impact the reproductive
   output of Antarctic moss species, potentially altering terrestrial
   ecosystems dynamics from the bottom up. Understanding these effects
   requires clarifying the foundational, mechanistic role that individual
   plant species play in mediating complex interactions in Antarctica's
   terrestrial food webs.}},

Abstract = {{Rhamnolipid production by two non-pathogenic bacterial strains
   Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Enterobacter asburiae, and established
   rhamnolipid producer Pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated.
   Rhamnolipids were separated from supernatant and further purified by
   thin-layer chromatography. Mass spectrometry with negative electrospray
   ionization revealed rhamnolipid homologues varying in chain length and
   unsaturation. Tandem mass spectrometry identified mono-rhamnolipid and
   dirhamnolipid homologues containing one or two 3-hydroxy fatty acids.
   Several media differing in carbon (sunflower oil, glycerol and sodium
   citrate), nitrogen (ammonium ions, nitrate) and phosphorus (total
   content) source, respectively, were tested to obtain enhanced
   rhamnolipid production. The best production (0.56 g/l) was obtained when
   nitrate was used as a nitrogen source. Both strains produced
   rhamnolipids that exhibited excellent emulsification activity with
   aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons and several plant oils. Unlike P.
   aeruginosa the two strains, i.e. Acinetobacter and Enterobacter, are not
   pathogenic to humans. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{823-836}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Consideration of the mechanisms associated with the granular
   disintegration of rock has been limited by available data. In most
   instances, both the size of the transducer and the nature of the stud
   have negated any applicability of the resulting data to the
   understanding, of grain-to-grain separation within rock. The application
   of microthermocouples (less than or equal to0.15 mm diameter) and
   high-frequency logging (20 s intervals) at a taffoni site on southern
   Alexander Island and from a rock outcrop on Adelaide Island (Antarctica)
   provide new data pertaining to the thermal conditions, at the grain
   scale, of the rock Surface. The results show that thermal changes
   (DeltaT/t) can be very high, with values of 22 degreesC min(-1) being
   recorded. Although available data indicate that there can be differences
   in frequency and magnitude of fluctuations as a function of aspect, all
   aspects experienced some large magnitude (greater than or equal to2
   degreesC min(-1)) fluctuations. Further, in many instances, large
   thermal changes in more than one direction could occur within 1 min or
   in subsequent minutes. These data suggest that the surface grains
   experience rapidly changing stress fields that may, with time, effect
   fatigue at the grain boundaries; albedo differences between grains and
   the resulting thermal variations are thought to exacerbate this. The
   available data failed to show any indication of water freezing (an
   exotherm) and thus it is suggested that microgelivation may not play as
   large a role in granular breakdown as is often postulated for cold
   regions, and that in this dry, Antarctic region thermal stress may play
   a significant role. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{69-84}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Much of the literature that analyzes the effect of various factors on
   basaltic weathering rates does not assess the synergistic effects of
   several factors at once. Those studies that do address such synergies
   generally report their results in formats that are difficult to
   integrate into geographic analysis. The research outlined in this paper
   employs multivariate statistics to assess the effect of several
   environmental variables on the weathering rate of basalts on the island
   of Hawaii. The presence of lichens on the surface of the basalt
   increases weathering rate by an order of magnitude. Weathering that
   occurs in the absence of lichen cover is regulated by high elevation/low
   temperature conditions, moisture availability, and the age of the flow.
   Weathering that occurs in the presence of lichen cover is regulated
   primarily by moisture availability only. The statistical results
   reported here are consistent with the results of a geochemical-style
   analysis of the same dataset reported elsewhere, suggesting that a
   multivariate approach is appropriate for assessing the simultaneous
   effects of multiple weathering factors on the weathering rate. A
   multivariate statistical approach allows for the construction of
   quantitative weathering rate models that build on previously published
   qualitative models for describing geographic variation in weathering
   rates.}},

Abstract = {{Here we report details of the European research initiative ``Soil Crust
   International{''} (SCIN) focusing on the biodiversity of biological soil
   crusts (BSC, composed of bacteria, algae, lichens, and bryophytes) and
   on functional aspects in their specific environment. Known as the
   so-called ``colored soil lichen community{''} (Bunte
   Erdflechtengesellschaft), these BSCs occur all over Europe, extending
   into subtropical and arid regions. Our goal is to study the uniqueness
   of these BSCs on the regional scale and investigate how this community
   can cope with large macroclimatic differences. One of the major aims of
   this project is to develop biodiversity conservation and sustainable
   management strategies for European BSCs. To achieve this, we established
   a latitudinal transect from the Great Alvar of A-land, Sweden in the
   north over Gossenheim, Central Germany and Hochtor in the Hohe Tauern
   National Park, Austria down to the badlands of Tabernas, Spain in the
   south. The transect stretches over 20A degrees latitude and 2,300 m in
   altitude, including natural (Hochtor, Tabernas) and semi-natural sites
   that require maintenance such as by grazing activities (A-land,
   Gossenheim). At all four sites BSC coverage exceeded 30 \% of the
   referring landscape, with the alpine site (Hochtor) reaching the highest
   cyanobacterial cover and the two semi-natural sites (A-land, Gossenheim)
   the highest bryophyte cover. Although BSCs of the four European sites
   share a common set of bacteria, algae (including cyanobacteria) lichens
   and bryophytes, first results indicate not only climate specific
   additions of species, but also genetic/phenotypic uniqueness of species
   between the four sites. While macroclimatic conditions are rather
   different, microclimatic conditions and partly soil properties seem
   fairly homogeneous between the four sites, with the exception of water
   availability. Continuous activity monitoring of photosystem II revealed
   the BSCs of the Spanish site as the least active in terms of
   photosynthetic active periods.}},

Abstract = {{Lichens growth is frequently widespread on surfaces of monumental stones
   and archeological areas. These symbiotic organisms may be harmful to
   stone substrata due both to their metabolic activity and to the induced
   physical-mechanical stresses exerted by the thalli. The topic related to
   their elimination is under debate, and usually their removal is carried
   out applying biocide formulates or physical stresses. The effective
   biocidal action of such treatments can be evaluated by some methods such
   as chlorophyll fluorescence measurements or live/dead staining. Since a
   damaged organism changes its cell functionality, a simple method based
   on the measurements of these changes, at a physiological level, can be
   applied. The induced damage on the cell-membranes can be evaluated by
   measuring the amount of leached ions by the whole symbiotic organism
   (both photobiont and mycobiont components) using the electrical
   conductivity (EC) method. In this study different stress actions (e.g.
   temperature heating and chemical treatment using the biocide Rocima
   103), were applied on lichens growing on monumental stone surfaces. The
   vitality of treated and untreated samples was evaluated by ions leakage
   and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements. The EC is a sensitive method
   for measuring the induced stress either on crustose lichens with a thick
   thallus or on foliose ones. This technique can be successfully used in
   the Cultural Heritage field, especially when the most suitable treatment
   conditions for implementing new control methods must be evaluated. In
   this paper, possible EC interferences of the lichens with stone
   substrata and with the applied biocide are discussed and solutions are
   suggested. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{203}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This study analyzes data of moss/lichen biocrusts on volcanic tephra at
   2335 m in Haleakala Crater (Maui, Hawai.i). Samples were compared among
   three adjacent positions: rolling crusts, pinnacled crusts, and bare
   tephra; two profiles contrasted substrate variation in crust and tephra
   areas. Field experiments assessed soil shear- and compressive-strength,
   infiltration rates, and diurnal soil temperatures; a lab experiment
   measured evaporation from crust specimens for 9 days. Biocrusts
   significantly affected physical, chemical, and structural soil
   properties. Fine particles, organic matter, and water storage were
   appreciably greater in biocrusts. Micro-sampling indicated
   upper-pinnacle sections accumulated more fine grains due to capture of
   volcanic ash, and also contained greater organic matter, than
   lower-pinnacle portions. Crust areas experienced infiltration rates
   similar to 2.8 times faster than tephra; mean diurnal temperatures were
   12.1 degrees C (26.9 vs 39.0 degrees C) cooler in crusts than in tephra.
   Saturated crust specimens stored similar to 2.7 times more moisture than
   tephra soils; slower evaporation in biocrusts significantly lengthened
   the period over which poikilohydric cryptogams are able to maintain
   metabolic activity. Soil shear- and compressive-strength were higher on
   crusts than on tephra. Biocrust soils showed greater fertility, as
   available Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, P, NH4+-N, and cation-exchange capacity were
   higher than in tephra. NH4+-N was more concentrated under rolling crusts
   than in pinnacled ones; this is mainly ascribed to sampling methodology.
   Buried profile horizons suggest the site experienced additional tephra
   deposition during episodic volcanic eruptions. A developmental model
   assesses interactions among soil and environmental processes, and
   provides an integrated geoecological view of linkages that influenced
   biocrust genesis.}},

   degrees C at two different rates. The strains were also shock frozen in
   liquid nitrogen. After repeated treatment, the strains were inoculated
   and cultivated on a BBM agar for 7 days. Then, cell viability was
   assessed as relative share of living cells. Potential quantum yield of
   photochemical reactions in PS IIl (F-V/F-M), and effective quantum yield
   of photochemical reactions in PS II (Phi(PSIII)) were measured. While
   the slow cooling rate (0.5 degrees C min(-1)) did not cause any change
   in viability, F-V/F-M, and Phi(PSIII), the fast cooling rate (6.0
   degrees C min(-1)) caused species-specific decrease in all parameters.
   The most pronounced interspecific differences in cryoresistance were
   found after shock freezing and consequent cultivation. While T.
   asymmetrica and T. jamesii exhibited low viability of living cells
   (18.9\% and 34.7\%) and full suppression of photosynthetic processes,
   the other strains had viability over 60\%, and unaffected values of
   F-V/F-M, and Phi(PSIII). This indicated a high degree of cryoresistance
   of T. glomerata, T. erici, T. irregularis and Trebouxia sp. strains.
   These strains could be used for detailed investigation of underlying
   physiological mechanisms and as models for astrobiological tests taken
   in the Earth facilities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The likelihood of dew to provide water to cyanobacteria (CB) and
   crustose lichens (CL) on soil is a matter of great controversy. Although
   vapour condensation takes place on cobbles of the Negev Highlands,
   facilitating lush cover of CL, controversy exists regarding the possible
   contribution of dew to CB and CL inhabiting the loessial soil of the
   Negev Highlands. To evaluate this matter, temperature, and measurements
   of the nonrainfall water (NRW) were conducted during the dewy season
   (August-November 2019). They included periodical NRW measurements using
   cloths attached to the (a) soil surface, (b) on top of 10 x 10 x 5- to
   6-cm cobbles, and (c) on 10 x 10 x 0.2-cm glass plates (the cloth-plate
   method, CPM). Additionally, temperature measurements took place at the
   soil and the cobble surfaces and in the air at 10-cm height above
   ground. Air temperature and the relative humidity measured by an
   adjacent meteorological station facilitated the calculation of the
   dew-point temperature (Td). Taking the CPM as reference, 24 mornings
   with NRW >= 0.03 mm (the threshold of lichen metabolism) were recorded.
   Vapour condensation, that is, NRW >= 0.1 mm were recorded during 16
   mornings on the cobbles (with a maximum of 0.21 mm) but never on the
   soil, where maximum NRW reached only 0.023 mm. Surface temperature never
   reached Td. We therefore conclude that unlike lithic lichens that
   inhabit bedrocks and cobbles in the Negev Highlands, dew cannot be
   regarded as a meaningful direct source of water for CB or CL biocrusts
   on soil.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated carotenoid and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) contents

   levels. Cyanobacteria do not possess the viotaxanthin cycle, which

Abstract = {{1 The northward expansion of the boreal forest vegetation zone is
   generally predicted under a warmer doubled CO2, but the delay associated
   with vegetation development processes often has been overlooked. In the
   subarctic forest-tundra of northern Quebec, reforestation of tundra
   uplands appears currently limited by the poor reproductive capacity of
   shrubby black spruce (Picea mariana), and the development of erect stems
   through accelerated height growth should be the first registered
   response to 20th century climate warming. The subarctic forest-tundra is
   characterized by small- and large-scale heterogeneity in topography,
   vegetation structure and climate. This spatial heterogeneity, added to
   the complexity of tree growth-climate relationships, can cause various
   growth responses of subarctic tree line black spruce to 20th century
   climate change.
   2 Twenty spruce populations at subarctic tree lines and seven isolated
   clones at the species limit were sampled along a > 300-km latitudinal
   transect from the southern forest-tundra to the shrub tundra. Height
   growth patterns of black spruce at tree line and above tree line were
   examined (i) over their life span, using dendrochronological dating of
   stem cross-sections, and (ii) for the recent decades, using leader shoot
   elongation measurements. Indexed elongation chronologies were compared
   with regional climate data.
   3 Height growth of tree line trees generally decreased with increasing
   latitude. However, tree line trees in the northern forest-tundra have
   experienced an acceleration of height growth since the 1970s, with their
   growth comparable to that of trees in the southern forest-tundra. Height
   growth response of spruce trees appeared increasingly delayed from the
   northern forest-tundra to the species limit. Above the subarctic tree
   line, wind-exposed conditions obscured the decrease in height growth
   with latitude observed for tree line trees.
   4 Leader shoot elongation of spruce trees established on tundra hilltops
   appeared more controlled by summer heat sums than those at tree line all
   over the forest-tundra, except at the arctic tree line. Winter
   precipitation also was linked to leader shoot elongation in some
   forest-tundra sites. The increasing snow cover associated with recent
   warming appeared to have reduced the shoot elongation of spruce at
   forest margins showing the steepest slopes, hence subjected to snow
   overloading.
   5 In the northern forest-tundra sites, the recent increase in height
   growth and positive trend in leader shoot elongation, consistent with a
   1990s' increase in heat sums, point to the development of spruce
   krummholz into erect growth forms. In the southern forest-tundra,
   reforestation of tundra hilltops and northward expansion of the boreal
   forest predicted under doubled CO2 conditions could be delayed, as
   suggested by suppressed height growth of spruce above tree line.}},

Abstract = {{Forest management greatly influences biodiversity across spatial scales.
   At the landscape scale, combining management systems that create
   different stand properties might promote biodiversity due to
   complementary species assemblages. In European beech forests, nature
   conservation and policy advocate a mixture of unmanaged (UNM) forests
   and uneven-aged (UEA) forests managed at fine spatial grain at the
   expense of traditionally managed even-aged shelterwood forests (EA).
   Evidence that such a landscape composition enhances forest biodiversity
   is still missing.
   We studied the biodiversity (species richness D-0, Shannon diversity
   D-1, Simpson diversity D-2) of 14 taxonomic groups from bacteria to
   vertebrates in `virtual' beech forest landscapes composed of varying
   shares of EA, UEA and UNM and investigated how gamma-diversity responds
   to landscape composition. Groups were sampled in the largest contiguous
   beech forest in Germany, where EA and UEA management date back nearly
   two centuries, while management was abandoned 20-70 years ago (UNM). We
   used a novel resampling approach that created all compositional
   combinations of management systems.
   Pure EA landscapes preserved a maximum of 97.5\% gamma-multidiversity
   (D-0, D-1) across all taxa. Pure and mixed UEA/UNM landscapes reduced
   gamma-multidiversity by up to 12.8\% (D-1). This effect was consistent
   for forest specialists (D-1: -15.3\%). We found only weak
   complementarity among management systems.
   Landscape composition significantly affected gamma-diversity of 6-9
   individual taxa, depending on the weighting of species frequencies with
   strongest responses for spiders, beetles, vascular plants and birds.
   Most showed maximum diversity in pure EA landscapes. Birds benefited
   from UNM in EA-dominated landscapes. Deadwood fungi showed highest
   diversity in UNM.
   Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that combining fine-grained
   forest management and management abandonment at the landscape scale will
   reduce, rather than enhance, regional forest biodiversity. We found an
   even-aged shelterwood management system alone operating at intermediate
   spatial scales and providing stands with high environmental
   heterogeneity was able to support regional biodiversity. However, some
   taxa require certain shares of uneven-aged and unmanaged forests,
   emphasizing their general importance. We encourage using the here
   presented resampling approach to verify our results in forest landscapes
   of different composition and configuration across the temperate zone.}},

   AMS 14 (similar to 35 km south of Fort McMurray) were more
   characteristic of urban areas with a unique pattern: eight of the lower

   during the warmer months. Enthalpies calculated from Clausius-Clapeyron
   plots for these eight PAHs suggest that atmospheric emissions were

Abstract = {{Since adequate information on the distribution of biodiversity is hardly
   achievable, biodiversity indicators are necessary to support the
   management of ecosystems. These surrogates assume that either some
   habitat features, or the biodiversity patterns observed in a well-known
   taxon, can be used as a proxy of the diversity of one or more target
   taxa. Nevertheless, at least for certain taxa, the validity of this
   assumption has not yet been sufficiently demonstrated.
   We investigated the effectiveness of both a habitat- and a taxa-based
   surrogate in six European beech forests in the Apennines. Particularly,
   we tested: (1) whether the stand structural complexity and the
   herb-layer species richness were good predictors of the fine-scale
   patterns of species richness of five groups of forest-dwelling organisms
   (beetles, saproxylic and epigeous fungi, birds and epiphytic lichens);
   and (2) the cross-taxon congruence in species complementarity and
   composition between herb-layer plants and the target taxa.
   We used Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs), accumulation curves and
   Procrustes analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of these surrogates
   when species richness, complementarity and composition were considered,
   respectively.
   Our results provided a limited support to the hypothesis that the
   herb-layer plants and the stand structural complexity were good
   surrogates of the target taxa. Although the richness of the herb-layer
   plants received a stronger support from the data than structural
   complexity as a predictor for the general patterns of species richness,
   the overall magnitude of this effect was weak and distinct taxa
   responded differently. For instance, for increasing levels of herb-layer
   richness, the richness of lichens showed a marked increase, while the
   richness of saproxylic fungi decreased. We also found significantly
   similar complementarity patterns between the herb-layer plants and
   beetles, as well as a significant congruence in species composition
   between herb-layer plants and saproxylic fungi. Finally, when different
   stand structural attributes were considered singularly, only the total
   amount of deadwood received support from the data as a predictor of the
   overall species richness.
   At the fine scale of this study, herb-layer plants and stand structural
   complexity did not prove to be effective surrogates of multi-taxon
   biodiversity in well-preserved southern European beech forests. Rather
   than on weak surrogates, these results suggest that sound conservation
   decisions should be supported by the information provided by
   comprehensive multi-taxonomic assessments of forest biodiversity. (C)

Abstract = {{Forests in the American Pacific Northwest receive very little nitrogen
   (N) through atmospheric deposition; therefore, they can provide insights
   into how the N cycle functioned in other regions before heavy
   atmospheric deposition of inorganic N began. Our objectives were to
   determine (a) if the fate of organic N differed from the fate of
   inorganic N, (b) the effect that polyphenols have on the fate of organic
   N, and (c) the effect of season of addition on the fate of N inputs. We
   traced N added to in situ soil cores as ammonium, organic N,
   tannin-complexed organic N, and the N-2-fixing lichen Lobaria oregana.
   Total N-15 recovery was between 74\% and 109\% for all N additions.
   Total N-15 recovery did not vary significantly from the first sampling
   date to the last date. The litter/organic horizon, as a bulk pool, was
   the largest N retention pool for all forms of N addition. Within the
   litter/organic horizon, the chloroform-extractable microbial biomass
   initially accounted for nearly all of the added N from the ammonium
   additions. On a different time scale, microbial biomass also played a
   noteworthy role in the retention of N from organic N, tannin-complexed
   organic N, and Lobaria. Complexing organic matter with tannin appeared
   to slow N cycling, but it did not significantly change the ultimate
   distribution of added organic N. Season of N addition had little effect
   on the retention of added N; however, where differences did occur,
   spring additions had lower recoveries than autumn additions.}},

Abstract = {{Key message Drivers of the abundance and richness of tree-related
   microhabitats are similar in mountain forests of Europe and North
   America and their occurrence may be explained by tree functional groups.
   A common approach to support forest-dwelling species in managed forests
   is to preserve valuable habitat trees. To assess the quality of habitat
   trees, a hierarchical typology of tree-related microhabitats (TreMs) is
   applied in the European context for inventory standardization. The first
   aim of this study was to evaluate whether it is possible to use this
   hierarchical typology as a standard protocol regardless of location,
   which is important for potentially standardizing future studies of
   TreMs, by testing whether the typology could be applied to the western
   North American mountain forests of Idaho. The second aim of the study
   was to analyse drivers that influence TreMs in forests of the region.
   Thirdly, we assessed whether the occurrence of TreMs could be explained
   by functional groups of trees across the western mountain forests of
   Idaho and Central European mountain forests, using TreM inventory data
   previously collected in the Black Forest, Germany. Abundance and
   richness of TreMs per tree were analyzed as a function of tree species,
   live status (dead vs. live trees), diameter at breast height (DBH), and
   site factors (latitude and altitude). Our results show that the TreM
   typology could be applied with slight modifications in the forests of
   Idaho. The abundance and richness of TreMs per tree increased with DBH.
   Snags offered more TreMs per tree than live trees. We were able to group
   tree species from the two continents in functional groups that were
   related to the occurrence of certain TreMs. Tree functional groups offer
   an opportunity to predict the role of certain tree species for habitat
   provision through TreMs. Combinations of trees from different functional
   groups could be used to optimize provisioning of TreMs within forest
   stands.}},

Pages = {{2275-2286}},
Abstract = {{The hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert, Chile, is possibly the driest
   and most life-limited place on Earth, yet endolithic microorganisms
   thrive inside halite pinnacles that are part of ancient salt flats. The
   existence of this microbial community in an environment that excludes
   any other life forms suggests biological adaptation to high salinity and
   desiccation stress, and indicates an alternative source of water for
   life other than rainfall, fog or dew. Here, we show that halite
   endoliths obtain liquid water through spontaneous capillary condensation
   at relative humidity (RH) much lower than the deliquescence RH of NaCl.
   We describe how this condensation could occur inside nano-pores smaller
   than 100 nm, in a newly characterized halite phase that is intimately
   associated with the endolithic aggregates. This nanoporous phase helps
   retain liquid water for long periods of time by preventing its
   evaporation even in conditions of utmost dryness. Our results explain
   how life has colonized and adapted to one of the most extreme
   environments on our planet, expanding the water activity envelope for
   life on Earth, and broadening the spectrum of possible habitats for life
   beyond our planet.}},

Title = {{Glacier change from the early Little Ice Age to 2005 in the Torngat
   Mountains, northern Labrador, Canada}},
Journal = {{GEOMORPHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{246}},
Pages = {{558-569}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{The glaciers of the Torngat Mountains of northern Labrador are the
   southernmost of the Canadian Arctic and the easternmost of continental
   North America. Currently, 195 small mountain glaciers cover an area in
   excess of similar to 24 km(2), confined mostly to small cirques and
   upland depressions. Using a combination of field and remote sensing
   methods this study reconstructs and dates the areal extent of Torngat
   glaciers at their Neoglacial maximums, enabling the first assessment of
   regional glacier change over the past several centuries. Mapped glacier
   paleomargins (n = 165) are compared to current (2005) glaciers and ice
   masses, showing a 52.5\% reduction in glacier area, with at least 11
   former glaciers altogether disappearing. Glacier change is spatially
   homogenous and independent of most geographic and topographic factors;
   however, glacier elevation and glacier size mitigated total change.
   Previously established lichen growth stations were revisited, and growth
   rates recalculated based on similar to 30-year-long records, enabling
   the construction of locally derived low- and high-altitude lichen growth
   curves. Using growth rates and in situ lichen measurements, the retreat
   from maximum Neoglacial moraine extents are suggested to have occurred
   between A.D. 1581 and 1673. These findings indicate a similar magnitude
   of post-LIA retreat to mountain glaciers elsewhere, yet a much earlier
   timing (similar to 200 years) of retreat than other glaciers in the
   eastern Canadian Arctic. Though no definitive answer explaining this
   discrepancy is presented, evidence suggests that regional climate
   dynamics and the importance of solar radiation for Torngat glaciers may
   play an important role in local glacierization. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Aim Overstorey tree species influence both soil properties and
   microclimate conditions in the forest floor, which in turn can induce
   changes in ground bryophyte communities. The aim of the study was to
   investigate the effect of tree species identity and the most important
   habitat factors influencing understorey bryophytes. Methods We assessed
   the effect of 14 tree species and related habitat parameters, including
   soil parameters, vascular plant presence and light intensity on
   bryophytes in monospecific plots covered by nearly fifty-year-old trees
   in the Siemianice Experimental Forest (Poland). Results The canopy tree
   species determined bryophyte species richness and cover. The strongest
   differences were observed between plots with deciduous and coniferous
   trees. Soils with a more acidic pH and lower content of macronutrients
   supported larger bryophyte coverage. We also found a positive
   correlations between vascular plants and availability of light as well
   as bryophyte species richness. Conclusion Tree species identity and
   differences in habitat conditions in the forest floor lead to changes of
   ground bryophyte richness, cover and species composition. Consequently,
   the changes in the dominant tree species in the stand may result in
   significant repercussions on ground bryophyte communities. We indicated
   that the introduction of alien tree species, i.e. Quercus rubra, has an
   adverse effect on bryophyte communities and suggested that the selection
   of tree species that contribute to the community consistent with the
   potential natural vegetation is highly beneficial for maintaining ground

Abstract = {{Dark respiration (DR) of lichens is reported to be higher in species

   conditions in the chlorolichens Lecanora muralis and Cladonia convoluta
   and the cyanolichen Collema cristatum. Data sets totalling 15 months,
   106 and 113 days, respectively, were obtained from automatic cuvettes
   that continually measured CO2 exchange and ambient conditions at 30 min
   intervals. For each 24 h period (sunrise to following sunrise), several
   measures of NP and DR were extracted, including maximal and mean rates
   and daily sums. No statistically significant correlations between the
   various measures of DR and preceding NP were found for L. muralis, only
   one weak correlation for Co. cristatum (the means of DR and NP) and
   three for Cl. convoluta (sums and means of DR and NP). It is proposed
   that even these significant correlations are actually a result of
   embedded codependencies between NP, DR and thallus water content.
   Overall it is concluded that no substrate-driven dependency of DR on
   preceding NP under natural conditions could be recognised. The periods
   of desiccation that often occur between the NP and following DR as well
   as the wide range of combinations of conditions would certainly
   contribute to this lack of relationship.}},

   bacterial community compositions varied with seasonal variations and
   that the dominant phyla were Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and
   Proteobacteria. Most of the fungi were affiliated with Ascomycota, and
   some of them were lichenized types and were related to the lichens that
   had already formed on the stelae. Chlorophyta and Cyanobacteria were the
   dominant algal groups that inhabited the stelae surfaces. Xanthoria and
   Lecanora were the most dominant genera, which belong to foliose lichen

Volume = {{14}},

Month = {{JUL 11}},
Abstract = {{Continuity in forest habitats is crucial for species diversity and
   richness. Ancient Scots pine forests are usually under forest
   management, which disturbs vegetation and causes differentiation in
   terms of tree stand age. To date, vegetation variability in ancient
   Scots pine forests has not been examined based on tree stand age
   classes. In the present study the continuity of a large Scots pine
   forest complex was investigated, and a system of sampling plots
   established in five tree stand age classes: initiation stands (4-10
   years), young stands (20-35 years), middle-aged stands (45-60 years),
   pre -mature stands (70-85 years) and mature stands (95-110 years).
   Species composition, including vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens,
   on soil, tree trunks, and coarse woody debris, was analyzed. Based on
   existing classifications systems, forest species and ancient forest
   species groups were distinguished. In the studied ancient Scots pine
   forests the species pool and richness were relatively low, and the
   vegetation consisted mostly of generalist species. Cryptogams, which can
   grow on diverse substrates, were the most abundant species. Moreover,
   most species could tolerate both forest and non -forest conditions. Age
   class forests provided different environmental niches for species.
   Initiation stands were optimal for terrestrial light -demanding species,
   and in terms of species composition, initiation stands were most
   specific. Young stands were most preferred by species on coarse woody
   debris, and at this stage of stand maturation epiphytic species re
   -appeared. The oldest stands were not rich in forest specialists, i.e.
   species of closed forest and ancient forest species. Cryptogams of
   closed forests inhabited different substrates, and they were not
   associated only with the oldest stands. The low number of forest
   specialists in the oldest stands may be a general feature of acidophilus
   pine forests. However, it may also be a result of the lack of species
   sources in the vicinity of maturing pine stands. In managed forests a
   frequent diversity pattern is an increase in a species pool and richness
   after clear-cut logging. In the present study we obtained higher species
   pools in initiation and young stands, but richness was similar in all
   tree stand age classes. This resulted from taking into account species
   of different substrates (terrestrial, epixylous and epiphytic species)
   which changed their participation in the vegetation of subsequent stages
   of tree stand development.}},

Abstract = {{Aiming to investigate whether a carbon-to-nitrogen equilibrium model
   describes resource allocation in lichens, net photosynthesis (NP),
   respiration (R), concentrations of nitrogen (N), chlorophyll (Chl),
   chitin and ergosterol were investigated in 75 different lichen
   associations collected in Antarctica, Arctic Canada, boreal Sweden, and
   temperate/subtropical forests of Tenerife, South Africa and Japan. The
   lichens had various morphologies and represented seven photobiont and 41
   mycobiont genera. Chl a, chitin and ergosterol were used as indirect
   markers of photobiont activity, fungal biomass and fungal respiration,
   respectively. The lichens were divided into three groups according to
   photobiont: (1) species with green algae, (2) species with
   cyanobacteria, and (3) tripartite species with green algal photobionts
   and cyanobacteria in cephalodia. Across species, thallus N concentration
   ranged from 1 to 50 mg g(-1) dry wt., NP varied 50-fold, and R 10-fold.
   In average, green algal lichens had the lowest, cyanobacterial Nostoc
   lichens the highest and tripartite lichens intermediate N
   concentrations. All three markers increased with thallus N
   concentration, and lichens with the highest Chl a and N concentrations
   had the highest rates of both P and R. Chl a alone accounted for ca.
   30\% of variation in NP and R across species. On average, the
   photosynthetic efficiency quotient {[}K-F=(NPmax+R)/R)] ranged from 2.4
   to 8.6, being higher in fruticose green algal lichens than in foliose
   Nostoc lichens. The former group invested more N in Chl a and this trait
   increased NPmax while decreasing R. In general terms, the investigated
   lichens invested N resources such that their maximal C input capacity
   matched their respiratory C demand around a similar (positive)
   equilibrium across species. However, it is not clear how this apparent
   optimisation of resource use is regulated in these symbiotic organisms.}},

Abstract = {{CO2 gas exchange, radial growth, chlorophyll (Chl) content and
   photobiont density of an epiphytic population of Parmelia sulcata were
   monitored every 2 months during 1 year in a temperate deciduous forest
   of Central Italy, to verify possible seasonal variations. Light response
   curves of south-exposed thalli, built up in the laboratory at 6 and 27A
   degrees C at optimal thallus hydration, showed that CO2 gas exchange
   changed significantly during the year, with a maximum for gross
   photosynthesis in December at both temperatures. Photoinhibition
   phenomena occurred in early spring, immediately before tree leaves
   sprouted. The principal component analysis of CO2 gas exchange
   parameters clearly separated the months with from the months without
   tree canopy cover. Radial growth, measured on marginal lobes of north-
   and south-exposed thalli, was the highest in December, and the lowest in
   April. Photobiont density, measured in lobes of south- and north-exposed
   thalli with a sedimentation chamber, also changed during the year: the
   number of photobionts was highest in June and December, and lowest in
   April, although no significant change in cell size and Chl content per
   cell was evident throughout the year. South-exposed thalli had slightly,
   but constantly higher photobiont density both on a weight and an area
   basis. The acclimation of lichen photosynthesis and Chl content to
   seasonal temperature and light changes should partially be re-visited on
   the basis of the significant variation in photobiont population density.
   This phenomenon still awaits, however, a satisfactory explanation,
   although it is probably related to the seasonal change in nutrient
   availability.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To develop a beta version of a preliminary set of empirically
   derived research diagnostic criteria (RDC) for burning mouth syndrome
   (BMS) through expert consensus, which can then be taken into a test
   period before publication of a final RDC/BMS.
   Design A 6 round Delphi process with twelve experts in the field of BMS
   was used. The first round formed a focus group during which the purpose
   of the RDC and the definition of BMS was agreed upon, as well as the
   structure and contents. The remaining rounds were carried out virtually
   via email to achieve a consensus of the beta version of the RDC/BMS.
   Results The definition of BMS was agreed to be `an intraoral burning or
   dysaesthetic sensation, recurring daily for more than 2 hours per day
   over more than 3 months, without evident causative lesions on clinical
   examination and investigation'. The RDC was based upon the already
   developed and validated RDC/TMD and formed three main parts: patient
   self-report; examination; and psychosocial self-report. A fourth
   additional part was also developed listing aspirational biomarkers which
   could be used as part of the BMS diagnosis where available, or to inform
   future research.
   Conclusion This Delphi process has created a beta version of an RDC for
   use with BMS. This will allow future clinical research within BMS to be
   carried out to a higher standard, ensuring only patients with true BMS
   are included. Further validation studies will be required alongside
   refinement of the RDC as trialling progresses.}},

Abstract = {{There is a significant lack of data in biomonitoring surveys from
   southern Europe and other Mediterranean biogeographic areas. This
   scarcity is mainly due to the impossibility of finding the commonly
   recommended species in a great portion of these dry environments. The
   present work was carried out with the aim of assessing the validity of
   the moss Pleurochaete squarrosa (Brid.) Lindb. (PS) as a feasible
   alternative in these regions. The study was developed in the
   Mediterranean area of Navarra, in northern Spain, where the response of
   PS to multiple atmospheric pollutants (N, Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg,
   Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Ti and Zn) was compared to that of Hypnum cupressifonne
   Hedw. (HC), an accepted and widely used species In biomonitoring
   surveys. Moreover, N isotopic signatures from both species were studied
   to evaluate their effectiveness when identifying nitrogen emission
   sources. The enrichment factor (EF) approach was used to evaluate the
   heavy metal uptake, showing a similar behaviour for both species: low EF
   for Al, As, Cr and Fe; intermediate for Mn, Ni, Pb and Sb; and high for
   Cd, Cr, Hg and Zn. Equally, both species depicted the same N deposition
   patterns across the study area. However, regarding delta N-15, PS gave a
   more congruent picture with the location of the main sources of N
   emissions in the area. These data suggest that PS may be a suitable
   biomonitor to fill the aforementioned gaps in Mediterranean
   biogeographic areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the important role that biocrust communities play in maintaining
   ecosystem structure and functioning in drylands world-wide, few studies
   have evaluated how climate change will affect them.
   Using data from an 8-yr-old manipulative field experiment located in
   central Spain, we evaluated how warming, rainfall exclusion and their
   combination affected the dynamics of biocrust communities in areas that
   initially had low (<20\%, LIBC plots) and high (>50\%, HIBC plots)
   biocrust cover.
   Warming reduced the richness (35 +/- 6\%), diversity (25 +/- 8\%) and
   cover (82 +/- 5\%) of biocrusts in HIBC plots. The presence and
   abundance of mosses increased with warming through time in these plots,
   although their growth rate was much lower than the rate of lichen death,
   resulting in a net loss of biocrust cover. On average, warming caused a
   decrease in the abundance (64 +/- 7\%) and presence (38 +/- 24\%) of
   species in the HIBC plots. Over time, lichens and mosses colonized the
   LIBC plots, but this process was hampered by warming in the case of
   lichens.
   The observed reductions in the cover and diversity of lichen-dominated
   biocrusts with warming will lessen the capacity of drylands such as that
   studied here to sequester atmospheric CO2 and to provide other key
   ecosystem services associated to these communities.}},

   (200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) was repeatedly monitored in lichens under
   controlled conditions, using chlorophyll fluorescence imaging with
   simultaneous recordings of wet mass. STM shaping the water holding
   capacity (WHC), water content in percent at start (WC), and water loss

   active periods during desiccation between (r(adj)(2) = 0.86) and within
   species (r(adj)(2) = 0.60-0.92). Lobaria pulmonaria with the lowest STM
   and the most upright growth form experienced the shortest active

Abstract = {{Ecophysiological characterizations of photoautotrophic communities are
   not only necessary to identify the response of carbon fixation related
   to different climatic factors, but also to evaluate risks connected to
   changing environments. In biological soil crusts (BSCs), the description
   of ecophysiological features is difficult, due to the high variability
   in taxonomic composition and variable methodologies applied. Especially
   for BSCs in early successional stages, the available datasets are rare
   or focused on individual constituents, although these crusts may
   represent the only photoautotrophic component in many heavily disturbed
   ruderal areas, such as parking lots or building areas with increasing
   surface area worldwide. We analyzed the response of photosynthesis and
   respiration to changing BSC water contents (WCs), temperature and light
   in two early successional BSCs. We investigated whether the response of
   these parameters was different between intact BSC and the isolated
   dominating components. BSCs dominated by the cyanobacterium Nostoc
   commune and dominated by the green alga Zygogonium ericetorum were
   examined. A major divergence between the two BSCs was their absolute
   carbon fixation rate on a chlorophyll basis, which was significantly
   higher for the cyanobacterial crust. Nevertheless, independent of
   species composition, both crust types and their isolated organisms had
   convergent features such as high light acclimatization and a minor and
   very late-occurring depression in carbon uptake at water
   suprasaturation. This particular setup of ecophysiological features may
   enable these communities to cope with a high variety of climatic
   stresses and may therefore be a reason for their success in heavily
   disturbed areas with ongoing human impact. However, the shape of the
   response was different for intact BSC compared to separated organ-isms,
   especially in absolute net photosynthesis (NP) rates. This emphasizes
   the importance of measuring intact BSCs under natural conditions for
   collecting reliable data for meaningful analysis of BSC ecosystem
   services.}},

Abstract = {{Describing spatial variation in species richness and understanding its
   links to ecological mechanisms are complementary approaches for
   explaining geographical patterns of richness. The study of elevational
   gradients holds enormous potential for understanding the factors
   underlying global diversity. This paper investigates the pattern of
   species richness and range-size distribution of epiphytic bryophytes
   along an elevational gradient in Marojejy National Park, northeast
   Madagascar. The main objectives are to describe bryophyte species
   composition and endemism in Marojejy National Park, to describe the
   species richness and distribution patterns of epiphytic bryophytes along
   an elevational gradient from 250 m to 2050 m and to evaluate the
   explanatory value of environmental variables for the observed patterns.
   Bryophyte samples were collected following a nested design with four
   hierarchical levels: elevational belts, plots, quadrats, and microplots.
   In total, 254 epiphytic bryophyte species were recorded, comprising 157
   liverworts and 97 mosses. Twenty-three of these are endemic to
   Madagascar. Species richness exhibits a hump-shaped pattern along the
   elevational gradient, peaking at 1,250 m. Eighty-seven percent of the
   total recorded species have a range distribution lower than 1,000 m, at
   which point 36\% are restricted to these single elevations. Our results
   suggest that mean temperature, relative humidity, and vapor pressure
   deficit play important roles in shaping the richness pattern observed in
   this study. While the liverwort richness pattern did not correlate to
   vapor pressure deficit and responded only weakly to relative humidity,
   the richness pattern shown by mosses correlates well with mean
   temperature, relative humidity, and vapor pressure deficit.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale agricultural development in high latitude regions could lead
   to large losses of soil C due to accelerated decomposition. Changes in
   decomposition rates of forest floor material upon land clearing in
   interior Alaska were simulated by measuring, over a 2-year period,
   changes in mass, cellulose, lignin, and N of forest floor materials and
   in mass of filter papers and wood in a forest floor and a fallowed
   field. All materials decomposed slowly at the surface, with about 90\%
   of the original weight remaining after 2 years. Decomposition rates were
   higher for materials buried in the field than the forest. Cellulose loss
   in forest floor materials closely followed mass loss, whereas lignin
   loss was not significant. However, weight loss of wood was rapid when
   buried in the field, with about 20\% of the initial mass remaining after
   2 years. Relationships between mass loss of buried forest floor
   materials and soil degree days were significant (r = 70\% - 80\%).
   Temperature was a major, but not the only factor, controlling
   decomposition rates. Forest floor materials showed significant N losses,
   indicating net N mineralization and that N deficiency was not a factor
   affecting decomposition. C loss to the atmosphere due to decomposition
   of forest floor materials after forest clearing will be minimal and
   similar to that in the undisturbed forest if left on the soil surface,
   but will be substantial if incorportated into the soil. Incorporation is
   necessary for cropping; thus some accelerated decomposition is
   unavoidable in clearing subarctic forests for cultivation.}},

Abstract = {{We observed the atmospheric resuspension of radiocaesium, derived from
   the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, at Namie, a heavily

   that the particles collected on filters in summer were predominantly of
   biological origin (bioaerosols), with which the observed radiocaesium
   activity concentration varied. We conducted an additional aerosol
   analysis based on fluorescent optical microscopic observation and
   high-throughput DNA sequencing technique to identify bioaerosols at
   Namie in 2015 summer. The concentrations of bioaerosols fluctuated the
   order of 10(6) particles per m(3), and the phyla Basidiomycota and
   Ascomycota (true Fungi) accounted for approximately two-thirds of the
   bioaerosols. Moreover, the fungal spore concentration in air was
   positively correlated with the radiocaesium concentration at Namie in

Abstract = {{Mercury (Hg) poses environmental and health risks due to its global
   distribution and high toxicity exhibited in some of its chemical forms.
   Although Hg is naturally present in the environment, human activities
   have increased its cycling among the land, atmosphere and ocean by a
   factor of three to five comparing the pre-industrial period to the
   present day. The Torviscosa chlor-alkali plant (CAP), which operated
   since the beginning of twentieth century, was one of the most important
   Cl-2 production capacity in the Northern Italy and was responsible for
   an uncontrolled discharge of Hg in the surrounding area. Previous
   studies reported the high degree of Hg pollution in soils, river
   sediments and surface waters of the area, but the Hg level in the
   atmospheric media was never taken into consideration. In this work, an
   integrated approach was applied with the aim to assess the level,
   distribution and dispersion of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) close to
   the CAP area. GEM levels were monitored by means of four surveys
   conducted from September 2014 to July 2015, at fixed locations and
   covering an area of about 10 km(2) (including CAP area, Torviscosa
   village and reclaimed land), accomplished to Hg bioaccumulation
   measurements in selected lichens. The results indicate that the CAP area
   currently represents the main source of GEM in the Friuli Venezia Giulia
   region. The highest levels were found close to the old factory's
   buildings (more than 5000 ng m(-3)), whereas other sites are less
   impacted. The emission of GEM is not clearly related to the intensity of
   solar radiation (temperature) at the soil level; however, this latter
   influences the release from the old buildings employed in the past for
   the production activities. The most important factor driving the GEM
   dispersion is the wind, as confirmed by the map of lichens
   bioaccumulation. In this context, the GEM plume partially affects the
   nearby village of Torviscosa (about 1 km), but the values found were
   always well below the international thresholds for residential areas,
   thus excluding the risk of inhalation for local inhabitants.}},

Abstract = {{The distributional ecology of 87 macrolichens is reported from 14
   unmanaged mid-seral and old forest stands along a precipitation gradient
   in south-central British Columbia. We used a combination of univariate
   and multivariate statistics to investigate the role of forest structure
   and stand age in the distribution of epiphytic macrolichens in interior
   cedar-hemlock forests. Old forests support a higher number of species;
   although mean species richness is not significantly different between
   the two age classes. Terricolous and epixylic community structure is
   correlated with stand age and log characteristics, but the epiphtytic
   community is not. Epiphytic community structure is strongly associated
   with precipitation in the old stands, but not in the mid-sera( stands.
   Old forests at the wetter end of the precipitation gradient contained
   several old-growth associated species, all of which are hygrophytic.
   Most epiphytic macrolichens associated with old forests are not
   dependent on specific structural attributes. However, western red cedar
   (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don) harbors the greatest number of arboreal
   macrolichen species by far in these unmanaged stands and should,
   therefore, be considered a key indicator in managed forests. Our study
   suggests that most macrolichen species found in old forests can also
   occur in 70- to 165-year-old forests dating from stand-replacing fires.
   Old forests, however, clearly provide important habitat for oceanic
   epiphytes at the edge of their ecological range in the interior of
   British Columbia. Our findings illustrate that the macrolichen flora in
   wet toe-slope stands in humid inland British Columbia has a high level
   of resilience following disturbance under natural succession conditions.
   It also underlines the point that some species, like Lobaria pulmonaria,
   are good indicators of old-growth forests in certain regions but not in
   others, suggesting a careful use of the term old-growth dependence.

Abstract = {{A model of the daily carbon balance of a black spruce/feathermoss boreal
   forest ecosystem was developed and results compared to preliminary data
   from the 1994 BOREAS field campaign in northern Manitoba, Canada. The
   model, driven by daily weather conditions, simulated daily soil climate
   status (temperature and moisture profiles), spruce photosynthesis and
   respiration, moss photosynthesis and respiration, and litter
   decomposition. Model agreement with preliminary field data was good for
   net ecosystem exchange (NEE), capturing both the asymmetrical
   seasonality and short-term variability. During the growing season
   simulated daily NEE ranged from -4 g C m(-2) d(-1) (carbon uptake by
   ecosystem) to +2 g C m(-2) d(-1) (carbon flux to atmosphere), with
   fluctuations from day to day. In the early winter simulated NEE values
   were +0.5 g C m(-2) d(-1), dropping to +0.2 g C m(-2) d(-1) in
   mid-winter. Simulated soil respiration during the growing season (+1 to
   +5 g C m(-2) d(-1)) was dominated by metabolic respiration of the live
   moss, with litter decomposition usually contributing less than 30\% and
   live spruce root respiration less than 10\% of the total. Both spruce
   and moss net primary productivity (NPP) rates were higher in early
   summer than late summer. Simulated annual NEE for 1994 was -51 g C m(-2)
   y(-1), with 83\% going into tree growth and 17\% into the soil carbon
   accumulation. Moss NPP (58 g C m(-2) y(-1)) was considered to be litter
   (i.e. soil carbon input; no net increase in live moss biomass).
   Ecosystem respiration during the snow-covered season (84 g C m(-2)) was
   58\% of the growing season net carbon uptake. A simulation of the same
   site for 1968-1989 showed approximate to 10-20\% year-to-year
   variability in heterotrophic respiration (mean of +113 g C m(-2) y(-1)).
   Moss NPP ranged from 19 to 114 g C m(-2) y(-1); spruce NPP from 81 to
   150 g C m(-2) y(-1); spruce growth (NPP minus litterfall) from 34 to 103
   g C m(-2) y(-1); NEE ranged from +37 to -142 g C m(-2) y(-1). Values for
   these carbon balance terms in 1994 were slightly smaller than the
   1969-89 means. Higher ecosystem productivity years (more negative NEE)
   generally had early springs and relatively wet summers; lower
   productivity years had late springs and relatively dry summers.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is expected to affect alpine and Arctic tundra
   communities. Most previous long-term studies have focused on impacts on
   vascular plants, this study examined impacts of long-term warming on
   bryophyte communities. Experimental warming with open-top chambers
   (OTCs) was applied for 18 years to a mesic meadow and a dry heath alpine
   plant community. Species abundance was measured in 1995, 1999, 2001 and
   2013. Species composition changed significantly from original
   communities in the heath, but remained similar in mesic meadow.
   Experimental warming increased beta diversity in the heath. Bryophyte
   cover and species richness both declined with long-term warming, while
   Simpson diversity showed no significant responses. Over the 18-year
   period, bryophyte cover in warmed plots decreased from 43 \% to 11 \% in
   heath and from 68 \% to 35 \% in meadow (75 \% and 48 \% decline,
   respectively, in original cover), while richness declined by 39 \% and
   26 \%, respectively. Importantly, the decline in cover and richness
   first emerged after 7 years. Warming caused significant increase in
   litter in both plant communities. Deciduous shrub and litter cover had
   negative impact on bryophyte cover. We show that bryophyte species do
   not respond similarly to climate change. Total bryophyte cover declined
   in both heath and mesic meadow under experimental long-term warming (by
   1.5-3 degrees C), driven by general declines in many species. Principal
   response curve, cover and richness results suggested that bryophytes in
   alpine heath are more susceptible to warming than in meadow, supporting
   the suggestion that bryophytes may be less resistant in drier
   environments than in wetter habitats. Species loss was slower than the
   decline in bryophyte abundance, and diversity remained similar in both
   communities. Increased deciduous shrub and litter cover led to decline
   in bryophyte cover. The non-linear response to warming over time
   underlines the importance of long-term experiments and monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between photosynthetic energy conservation and thermal
   dissipation of light energy is considered, with emphasis on organisms
   which tolerate full desiccation without suffering photo-oxidative damage

   organisms, they resume photosynthetic water oxidation. Only excess light
   is then thermally dissipated in mosses and chlorolichens by a mechanism
   depending on the protonation of a thylakoid protein and availability of
   zeaxanthin. Upon desiccation, another mechanism is activated which
   requires neither protonation nor zeaxanthin although the
   zeaxanthin-dependent mechanism of energy dissipation remains active,
   provided desiccation occurs in the light. Increased thermal energy
   dissipation under desiccation finds expression in the loss of variable,
   and in the quenching of, basal chlorophyll fluorescence. Spectroscopical
   analysis revealed the activity of photosystem II reaction centres in the
   absence of water. Oxidized beta-carotene (Car(+)) and reduced
   chlorophyll (Chl(-)), perhaps ChlD1 next to P680 within the D1 subunit,
   accumulates reversibly under very strong illumination. Although
   recombination between Car(+) and Chl(-) is too slow to contribute
   significantly to thermal energy dissipation, a much faster reaction such
   as the recombination between P680(+) and the neighbouring Chl(-) is
   suggested to form the molecular basis of desiccation-induced energy
   dissipation in photosystem II reaction centres. Thermal dissipation of
   absorbed light energy within a picosecond time domain deactivates
   excited singlet chlorophyll, thereby preventing triplet accumulation and
   the consequent photo-oxidative damage by singlet oxygen.}},

Abstract = {{Caribou are an integral component of high-latitude ecosystems and
   represent a major subsistence food source for many northern people. The
   availability and quality of winter habitat is critical to sustain these
   caribou populations. Caribou commonly use older spruce woodlands with
   adequate terrestrial lichen, a preferred winter forage, in the
   understory. Changes in climate and fire regime pose a significant threat
   to the long-term sustainability of this important winter habitat.
   Computer simulations performed with a spatially explicit vegetation
   succession model (ALFRESCO) indicate that changes in the frequency and
   extent of fire in interior Alaska may substantially impact the abundance
   and quality of winter habitat for caribou. We modeled four different
   fire scenarios and tracked the frequency, extent, and spatial
   distribution of the simulated fires and associated changes to vegetation
   composition and distribution. Our results suggest that shorter fire
   frequencies (i.e., less time between recurring fires) on the winter
   range of the Nelchina caribou herd in eastern interior Alaska will
   result in large decreases of available winter habitat, relative to that
   currently available, in both the short and long term. A 30\% shortening
   of the fire frequency resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in the area burned
   annually and an associated 41\% decrease in the amount of spruce-lichen
   forest found on the landscape. More importantly, simulations with more
   frequent fires produced a relatively immature forest age structure,
   compared to that which currently exists; with few stands older than 100
   years. This age structure is at the lower limits of stand age classes
   preferred by caribou from the Nelchina herd. Projected changes in fire
   regime due to climate warming and/or additional prescribed burning could
   substantially alter the winter habitat of caribou in interior Alaska and
   lead to changes in winter range use and/or population dynamics.}},

   between a fungus (mycobiont), a green alga (Coccomyxa sp.), and
   N-2-fixing cyanobacteria (Nostoc sp.)as a model organism to assess the
   effects of environmental perturbations in nitrogen (N) or phosphorus
   (P). Growth, carbon (C) and N stable isotopes, CNP concentrations, and
   specific markers were analyzed in whole thalli and the partners after
   4months of daily nutrient additions in the field. Thallus N was 40\%
   higher in N-fertilized thalli, amino acid concentrations were twice as
   high, while fungal chitin but not ergosterol was lower. Nitrogen also
   resulted in a thicker algal layer and density, and a higher C-13
   abundance in all three partners. Photosynthesis was not affected by
   either N or P. Thallus growth increased with light dose independent of
   fertilization regime. We conclude that faster algal growth compared to
   fungal lead to increased competition for light and CO2 among the
   Coccomyxa cells, and for C between alga and fungus, resulting in neither
   photosynthesis nor thallus growth responded to N fertilization. This
   suggests that the symbiotic lifestyle of lichens may prevent them from

Abstract = {{A multidisciplinary study was carried out to understand the interactions
   between biotic and abiotic processes in granite weathering in ice-free
   areas of Northern Victoria Land, Antarctica. Examples of tafoni, pits
   and grooves were analyzed, focusing on their morphometry, infills,
   weathering rind types and vegetation patterns. Surface and subsurface
   temperatures and incoming radiation were measured to characterize
   microclimatic conditions. In addition, microscopic, SEM and X-ray
   diffraction analyses of granite were carried out. These analyses
   indicate that, under present conditions, mechanical weathering is the
   main process active in the formation of tafoni, which post-date pits and
   grooves. In these forms, granular disintegration is mainly induced by
   chasmoendolithic lichens, salt and thermal stress associated with the
   dilatation coefficients of different granite-forming minerals. The
   overall morphology of pits and grooves indicates that they originate
   from water erosion. In the former, mechanical weathering prevails,
   caused by epilithic lichens, by freeze-thaw events, and by salt, while
   only the first two processes are active in the grooves. The intensity of
   these processes is less effective than in tafoni and on the outer
   surfaces, suggesting that pits and grooves are inherited features,
   possibly generated in the same way as landforms occurring on granite in
   the humid tropics. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley A Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. In a cohort of 500 patients complaining about adverse effects
   from dental materials, allergies were found to be contributing to the
   patients' subjective complaints in only about 14\% of the cases.
   Therefore, the aim of this retrospective study was to investigate an
   enlarged cohort of 625 patients reporting on adverse effects from dental
   materials on non-allergy related dental or orofacial findings with
   relevance for their subjective complaints. Methods. 625 patients
   visiting a specialized consultation on suspected adverse effects from
   dental materials were characterized regarding age and sex distribution,
   subjective complaints, allergies, and dental and orofacial findings with
   relevance for their subjective complaints. Results. This cohort
   comprised about 81\% females and the median age was 58 years. The most
   often reported subjective complaints were burning mouth (43.8\%), taste
   disorders (28.8\%) and dry mouth (22.7\%). Allergies toward dental
   materials were found in 12.3\%. In 28.0\% of the patients, no dental or
   orofacial findings with relevance for the subjective complaints
   expressed by the patients could be found. 19.8\% of the patients
   exhibited relevant functional symptoms, 16.2\% relevant orofacial
   diseases, 15.2\% relevant mechanical irritations, 10.1\% or 9.4\%
   relevant tooth-related or plaque-related symptoms, respectively, 9.4\%
   hyposalivation, and in 7.2\% relevant manufacturing faults were found.
   Significance. In patients complaining about adverse effects from dental
   materials, a wide variety of dental or orofacial findings need to be
   considered despite allergies, although a quarter of the patients did not
   present any relevant dental or orofacial finding. Therefore, specialized
   consultations and close collaboration with experts from other fields are
   eligible. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf

   experiment was conducted over 14 days using reindeer droppings and

   weak emission of N2O. Reindeer droppings originating from the winter
   diet had a negligible effect on the exchange fluxes of both CH4 and N2O.
   Although the presence of droppings resulted in a short-lasting increase

Abstract = {{Old-growth cedar-hemlock forests of the interior wet-belt of British
   Columbia are rich in abundance and diversity of canopy lichens, but are
   subject to forest harvesting. If these distinctive canopy lichen
   communities are to be conserved, it is important to learn how they are
   affected by forestry practices, including partial-cutting techniques
   designed to retain old-growth attributes. The retention of canopy
   lichens after 30 and 70\% partial-cut harvesting (immediate post-harvest
   and 2-year post-harvest measurements) was examined using direct canopy
   access methods (tree climbing) in two old-growth interior cedar-hemlock
   forest stands of the upper Fraser River valley. Mean lichen loading was
   generally lower in all treatment areas, including control sites, 2 years
   after harvesting. However, three of four lichen-sampling groups
   (cyanolichen, foliose, and Bryoria group lichens) did not show
   significant treatment effects (total lichen loading) by harvesting type
   (30, 70 or 100\% retention), when data sets were standardized against
   initial post-harvest lichen loading. Only in Alectoria group lichens
   were treatment effects observed. Although cyanolichen loading was not
   significantly different in retained trees in most harvest blocks, many
   thalli, especially those near south-facing edges, were discolored,
   suggesting that future cyanolichen loading may be lower within
   partial-cut harvest blocks. Litterfall in general was greater during
   2001/2002 than 2002/2003, even in the control units, suggesting
   weather-related differences between years. For Alectoria, there appeared
   to be a treatment-related pulse of litterfall that was more pronounced
   in the 70\% removal than the 30\% removal treatment unit. Deposition
   patterns of litterfall components in relation to edges of openings
   indicated a heightened level of Alectoria litterfall along edges.
   Treatment-related differences were absent or weak in other groups, and
   cyanolichen litterfall did not differ between years in any study
   area/treatment unit combination. These findings suggest that lichen
   retention in the residual stand of both partial-cut treatments was
   adequate to meet management goals, but also point to the necessity of
   future monitoring, as other edge effects (e.g. microclimate changes)
   influence future lichen growth and mortality. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Conflicting evidence of the impact of forest management on biodiversity
   exists, either decreasing or increasing species richness. Variable
   diversity responses may result from the adoption of different unmanaged
   reference systems, ranging from stands with management abandonment in
   the recent past to true primeval forests. We compared the species
   richness of epiphytic bryophytes and lichens and vascular forest floor
   plants in three primeval forest/production forest pairs of
   Fagus-sylvatica in Slovakia, adopting a replicated design and a
   reference system without any management legacy. Mean number of bryophyte
   and lichen species per 500 m(2)-plot tended to be higher in the primeval
   forests, while the mean a-diversity of vascular plants was higher in the
   production forests. In contrast, the 13-diversity of the three plant
   groups as expressed by the Sorensen Dissimilarity Index was generally
   higher in the primeval forest plot sample, reflecting a higher
   heterogeneity of plant community composition and habitat diversity.
   Plotting cumulative species numbers against plot numbers suggests that
   the curves for bryophyte and lichen species richness may saturate at ca.
   250 plots similar to 12.5 ha in the primeval forests, but already at
   30-60 plots (<3 ha) in the more homogeneous production forests. Total
   bryophyte and lichen species numbers are estimated to be 30-100\% larger
   in the primeval forests than the production forests. Contrary to general
   belief, vascular plant species richness was similarly high, or even
   higher, in the primeval forests when >50 plots (total area: 2.5 ha) were
   investigated, evidencing the importance of natural disturbance regimes
   for maintaining high forest biodiversity. Our results show that Fagus
   sylvatica primeval forests are inhabited by a species-rich epiphyte
   flora despite the species poverty of the tree layer. This evidences the
   outstanding value of primeval forest reserves for the conservation of
   temperate forest biodiversity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The survival strategies of one cyanobacteria colony and three
   terricolous lichen species from the hot subdesert of Tabernas, Spain,
   were studied along with topographical attributes of the area to
   investigate whether the protective strategies adopted by these pioneer
   soil colonizers are related to the environmental stressors under which
   they survive. A handheld Raman spectrometer was used for biomolecular
   characterization, while the microclimatic and topographic parameters
   were estimated with a Geographic Information System (GIS). We found that
   the survival strategies adopted by those organisms are based on
   different combinations of protective biomolecules, each with diverse
   ecophysiological functions, such as UV-radiation screening, free-energy
   quenching, antioxidants, and the production of different types and
   amounts of calcium oxalates. Our results show that the cyanobacteria
   community and each lichen species preferentially colonized a particular
   microhabitat with specific moisture and incident solar radiation levels
   and exhibited different adaptive mechanisms. In recent years, a number
   of studies have provided consistent results that suggest a link between
   the strategies adopted by those extremophile organisms and the
   microclimatic environmental parameters. To date, however, far too little
   attention has been paid to results from Raman analyses on dry specimens.
   Therefore, the results of the present study, produced with the use of
   our miniaturized instrument, will be of interest to future studies in
   astrobiology, especially due to the likely use of Raman spectroscopy at

   Maximal photosynthetic rates were 4.97 and 7.75 mumol m(-2) s(-1) for

   crusts from dunes and pans respectively: both lower and higher moisture
   contents resulted in decreased rates of photosynthesis. With increasing
   atmospheric CO2 concentrations up to at least 1000 ppm, photosynthesis
   of both sorts of crusts increased linearly to rates several times that
   of rates at natural CO2 concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{An extensive survey of spruce growth forms was conducted in frost
   hollows of the Pare national des Grands-Jardins located in the highlands
   of the Charlevoix region (Quebec). Frost hollows studied were situated
   within lichen woodlands, which are a favourable environment for the
   formation of cold air masses. The mean number of frosts recorded I m
   aboveground during the growing seasons of 1997-2002 indicates that there
   is no frost-free period in frost hollows. Based on the records of
   minimum temperature in two frost hollows, the critical threshold for
   frost-ring formation is a nocturnal temperature below 0 degrees C for
   6.4 h with a climax at around -5.7 degrees C, i.e., at a cooling rate of
   1.78 degrees C/h under the freezing point for at least 3.2 h. Frequent
   and severe nocturnal frosts slow down the colonization of black spruce
   in frost hollows, and are at the origin of the inverted tree line that
   surrounds frost hollows. Mean stem height of black spruce in frost
   hollows is 1.97m +/- 2.15. A comparative analysis of aerial photographs
   between 1950 and 1996 showed a 34\% reduction in frost hollow area due
   to the progressive colonization of black spruce. Massive tree
   establishment occurred in frost hollows between 1970 and 1980 because of
   the reduced frequency of freezing temperatures during the growing
   season.}},

   natroxalate mineral using density functional theory}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{263}},
Pages = {{131-140}},

Abstract = {{Natroxalate mineral, Na2C2O4, is a fundamental oxalate mineral
   widespread in nature, present in humans, animals and plants, as well as
   in naturally occurring minerals. The characterization of oxalate
   minerals is extraordinarily important since these organic minerals are
   indicators of environmental events and of the presence of biological
   activity, because they are commonly of biological origin. These minerals
   are currently under study to investigate the possible biological
   activity on Mars. The identification of these compounds is usually
   performed by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Theoretical
   calculations are of great value for the study and interpretation of the
   results of these experimental techniques. In this work, natroxalate
   mineral structure and Raman spectrum was studied by first principle
   calculations based on the density functional theory. The computed
   structure of natroxalate reproduces the one determined experimentally by
   X-ray diffraction (monoclinic symmetry, space group P2(1)/c; lattice
   parameters a = 3.449 A, b = 5.243 A; c = 10.375 A). Lattice parameters,
   bond lengths, bond angles and X-ray powder pattern were found to be in
   very good agreement with their experimental counterparts. Raman spectrum
   was then computed by means of density functional perturbation theory and
   compared with the experimental spectrum. Since the results were also
   found in agreement with the experimental data, a normal mode analysis of
   the theoretical spectra was carried out and used in order to assign the
   main bands of the Raman spectrum. The band found at about 567 cm(-1),
   described as a single peak in previous experimental works, is shown
   clearly to have two contributing bands. Finally, two bands of the
   observed spectrum, located at the wavenumbers 1750 and 1358 cm(-1), were
   not found in the theoretical spectrum. This is because these bands
   correspond to an overtone, 2v(1) (v(1) = 875 cm(-1)), and a combination
   band, V-1 + v(2) (v(1),v(2) = 875, 481 cm(-1)), respectively. Finally,
   the fundamental thermodynamic properties of natroxalate mineral were
   determined. The calculated specific heat at 298.15 K is in excellent
   agreement with the experimental value, the difference being less than
   1\%. Since for most of these properties there are not experimental
   values to compare with, their values were predicted.}},

Title = {{Southern African Biological Soil Crusts are Ubiquitous and Highly

Abstract = {{Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are found in all dryland regions of the
   world, including the polar regions. They are also known to occur in the
   southern African region. Although there were a number of case studies on
   BSCs from that region, we did not know if they are a normal part of the
   vegetation cover or just a phenomenon that occasionally occurs here and
   there. In order to investigate diversity, distribution patterns, and the
   driving factors of both, we followed a random sampling system of
   observatories along a transect, stretching from the Namibian-Angolan
   border down south to the Cape Peninsula, covering seven different major
   biomes. Biological soil crusts were found to occur in six out of seven
   biomes. Despite the fact that soil-dwelling algae occurred in the Fynbos
   biome, crust formation was not observed for hitherto unknown reasons.
   Seven BSC types were distinguished on the basis of morphology and
   taxonomic composition: three of them were cyanobacteria-dominated, one
   with additional chlorolichens, two with bryophytes, one hypolithic type
   restricted to quartz gravel pavements, and the unique lichen fields of
   the Namib Desert. Besides 29 green algal species in 21 genera, one
   heterokont alga, 12 cyanolichens, 14 chlorolichens, two genera of
   liverworts, and three genera of mosses, these crusts are positioned
   among the most diverse BSCs worldwide mainly because of the unusual high
   cyanobacterial species richness comprising 58 species in 21 genera. They
   contribute considerably to the biodiversity of arid and semi-arid
   bioregions. Taxonomic diversity of cyanobacteria was significantly
   higher in the winter rain zone than in the summer rain zone (54 versus
   32 species). The soil photosynthetic biomass (chlorophyll(a)/m(2)), the
   carbon content of the soil and the number of BSC types were
   significantly higher in the winter rain zone (U (27, 29) = 215.0, p =
   0.004 {[}chl(a)]; U (21, 21) = 135.0, p = 0.031 {[}C]; U (27, 29) =
   261.5, p = 0.028 {[}BSC types]; excluding the fog-dominated Namib
   biome). The winter rain zone is characterized by a lower precipitation
   amount, but a higher rain frequency with the number of rainy days more
   evenly distributed over the year. The dry period is significantly
   shorter per year in the winter rain zone (U (8, 9) = 5.0, p = 0.003). We
   conclude that rain frequency and duration of dry periods rather than the
   precipitation amount is the main factor for BSC growth and succession.
   Nitrogen content of the soils along the transect was generally very low
   and correlated with soil carbon content. There was a weak trend that an
   increasing proportion of silt and clay (< 0.63 mm) in the soil is
   associated with higher values of BSC chlorophyll content (Pearson
   correlation coefficient = 0.314, p = 0.237). Furthermore, we found a
   significant positive correlation between silt and clay and the number of
   BSC types (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.519, p = 0.039),
   suggesting that fine grain-size promotes BSC succession and their
   biomass content. Lichens and bryophytes occurred in BSCs with lower
   disturbance frequencies (e.g. trampling) only. Crust thickness and
   chlorophyll content increased significantly from crusts of the early
   successional type to the late successional crust types.
   From our results, we conclude that BSCs are a normal and frequent
   element of the vegetation in arid and semi-arid southwestern Africa, and
   that rain frequency and duration of dry periods rather than the
   precipitation amount are the key factors for the development,
   differentiation and compsition of BSCs.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of cyanolichens to sustain growth in even-aged forests that
   develop after clear-cut harvesting is a major conservation biology
   concern in British Columbia's inland rainforest. This and other
   conservation issues have led to proposals advocating partial-cut rather
   than clear-cut harvesting to better maintain the structures that support
   biodiversity in old-growth forest stands. However, evaluating the
   potential impacts of alternative harvesting practices cannot occur
   without first understanding lichen growth responses to the existing
   range of natural variability in canopy structure. Using transplant
   experiments with thalli of Lobaria pulmonaria (a tripartite foliose
   cyanolichen), we evaluate growth responses to canopy structure in both
   naturally occurring 120 year old small-patch even-aged stands and in
   adjacent old-growth uneven-aged forest stands. Canopy microclimate was
   also measured in old-growth reference trees, allowing calculation of
   energy conversion efficiency for old-growth L. pulmonaria thalli. Growth
   rates of L. pulmonaria transplants showed a strong correlation with
   canopy light transmission (CLT). Mean annual lichen dry matter gain over
   the 2-year measurement period ranged from less than 5\% on branches in
   closed canopy even-aged stands (< 1 mol m(-2) day(-1) CLT) to near 20\%
   on branches under canopy gaps in old-growth stands (> 18 mol m(-2)
   day(-1) CLT). Intercepted irradiance of hydrated L. pulmonaria thalli
   (I-wet) under old-growth stand conditions was 24.7 and 45.5 MJ m(-2)
   annually in years 2 and 3 of the study, resulting in an energy
   conversion efficiency of 1.33 and 0.61\%, respectively. Open sky (gap
   fraction) above lichen transplants in old-growth stands was much greater
   than that found in even-aged stands, allowing for longer duration
   sunfleck events in the lower canopy of the old-growth forest stands.
   These findings suggest that the creation of small openings by
   partial-cut harvesting in the inland rainforest may result in conditions
   favourable to continued growth of the dominant canopy cyanolichen, L.
   pulmonaria. They also support existing concerns about future cyanolichen
   growth in even-aged forests regenerating after clear-cut harvesting. (c)

Abstract = {{Live trees influence the nutrient status of the soil by the interception
   of substances from the atmosphere, the uptake of nutrients from the
   soil, and the deposition of litter. In an unmanaged old-growth spruce
   mountain forest on acidic soil, we analyzed how the death and decay of
   spruce trees affects the acidity and element concentrations of the soil,
   tree bark (or outermost stemwood) and stemflow. Key study objective was
   to examine whether the element release from decaying deadwood
   significantly increases the available soil nutrient stocks in the
   senescence phase of coniferous forests. Bark and stemflow chemistry
   responded to the death and decay of the trees with lowered acidity and
   reduced nutrient concentrations, which was attributed to the gradual
   loss of the intercepting canopy surface. Bark and stemflow
   concentrations of base cations (K, Ca, Mg) showed a transient peak in
   the course of wood decay. Published evidence suggests that the
   variability in bark and stemflow chemistry detected across the sequence
   of wood decay stages was sufficient to shape the epiphytic lichen and
   bryophyte communities. The death and decay of spruce trees also resulted
   in elevated base saturation near standing deadwood. Downed deadwood had
   a negligible effect on soil chemistry, among others due to slow
   decomposition in the studied cold mountain forest. Soil acidity was not
   significantly affected by deadwood. The release of base cations from
   standing deadwood to the soil suggests that sparing part of the trees in
   managed forests from logging could counteract nutrient depletion through
   timber harvesting.}},

Abstract = {{Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are a common element of the
   Queensland (Australia) dry savannah ecosystem and are composed of
   cyanobacteria, algae, lichens, bryophytes, fungi and heterotrophic
   bacteria. Here we report how the CO2 gas exchange of the
   cyanobacteria-dominated biocrust type from Boodjamulla National Park in
   the north Queensland Gulf Savannah responds to the pronounced climatic
   seasonality and on their quality as a carbon sink using a semi-automatic
   cuvette system. The dominant cyanobacteria are the filamentous species
   Symplocastrum purpurascens together with Scytonema sp. Metabolic
   activity was recorded between 1 July 2010 and 30 June 2011, during which
   CO2 exchange was only evident from November 2010 until mid-April 2011,
   representative of 23.6\% of the 1-year recording period. In November at
   the onset of the wet season, the first month (November) and the last
   month (April) of activity had pronounced respiratory loss of CO2. The
   metabolic active period accounted for 25\% of the wet season and of that
   period 48.6\% was net photosynthesis (NP) and 51.4\% dark respiration
   (DR). During the time of NP, net photosynthetic uptake of CO2 during
   daylight hours was reduced by 32.6\% due to water supersaturation. In
   total, the biocrust fixed 229.09 mmolCO(2) m(-2) yr(-1), corresponding
   to an annual carbon gain of 2.75 gm(-2) yr(-1). Due to malfunction of
   the automatic cuvette system, data from September and October 2010
   together with some days in November and December 2010 could not be
   analysed for NP and DR. Based on climatic and gas exchange data from
   November 2010, an estimated loss of 88 mmolCO(2) m(-2) was found for the
   2 months, resulting in corrected annual rates of 143.1 mmolCO(2) m(-2)
   yr(-1), equivalent to a carbon gain of 1.7 gm(-2) yr(-1). The bulk of
   the net photosynthetic activity occurred above a relative humidity of 42
   \%, indicating a suitable climatic combination of temperature, water
   availability and light intensity well above 200 mu mol photonsm 2 s(-1)
   photosynthetic active radiation. The Boodjamulla biocrust exhibited high
   seasonal variability in CO2 gas exchange pattern, clearly divided into
   metabolically inactive winter months and active summer months. The
   metabolic active period commences with a period of up to 3 months) of
   carbon loss, likely due to reestablishment of the crust structure and
   restoration of NP prior to about a 4-month period of net carbon gain. In
   the Gulf Savannah biocrust system, seasonality over the year
   investigated showed that only a minority of the year is actually
   suitable for biocrust growth and thus has a small window for potential
   contribution to soil organic matter.}},

Journal = {{ECOSCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{We present the longest tree-ring chronology to date in northeastern
   North America (2233 years; 227 BCE - 2005 CE), resulting from several
   research projects conducted at the subarctic treeline in northern
   Quebec. This raw chronology of tree-ring width includes 464 black spruce
   (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) shrubs (krummholz) growing in wetlands
   and preserved within peatlands. An indexed series of 152 erect black
   spruce trees that have lived in wetlands is also presented, covering the
   period 216 BCE to 1619 CE. We compared these chronologies to a tree-ring
   series including 116 black spruce trees and krummholz having grown on
   well-drained lichen woodlands over the period 1304-2000 CE. These
   chronologies highlight the major climatic periods of the last two
   millennia. Floating chronologies dating from 2500 to 3500 years ago were
   also developed from trees preserved in frozen peat. Growth rings from
   this period are much wider than those of the last 2233 years, suggesting
   warm climatic conditions and permafrost-free peatlands during the
   transition from mid- to late Holocene. The three subarctic chronologies
   presented here underscore the relevance and usefulness of tree growth
   rings and growth forms as ecological tools to assess the influence of

Volume = {{141}},

Abstract = {{Microwave imagery has a distinct advantage over optical imagery in
   high-latitude areas because it allows data to be acquired independently
   of cloud cover and solar illumination. Synthetic aperture radar
   (SAR)-based monitoring has become increasingly important for
   understanding the state and dynamics of permafrost landscapes at the
   regional scale. This study presents a permafrost landscape mapping
   method that uses multi-temporal TerraSAR-X backscatter intensity and
   interferometric coherence information. The proposed method can classify
   permafrost landscape features and map the two most important features in
   sub-arctic permafrost environments: permafrost-affected areas and
   thermokarst ponds. First, a land cover map is generated through the
   combined use of object-based image analysis (OBIA) and classification
   and regression tree (CART) analysis. An overall accuracy of 98\% is
   achieved when classifying rock and water bodies, and an accuracy of 79\%
   is achieved when discriminating between different vegetation types with
   one year of single-polarized acquisitions. Second, the distributions of
   the permafrost affected areas and thermokarst ponds are derived from the
   classified landscapes. Permafrost-affected areas are inferred from the
   relationship between vegetation cover and the existence of permafrost,
   and thermokarst pond distributions are directly inherited from the land
   cover map. The two mapped features exhibit good agreement with manually
   delineated references. The proposed method can produce permafrost
   landscape maps in complex sub-arctic environments and improve our
   understanding of the effects of climate change on permafrost landscapes.
   This classification strategy can be transferred to other time-series SAR
   datasets, e.g., Sentinel-1, and other heterogeneous environments. (C)

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine the activity concentrations of

   airborne radionuclides (Pb-210, Pb-210(ex) and Be-7) in natural

   species were collected from 17 sampling localities in the National Parks
   and Wildlife Sanctuaries of Thailand, situated in the mountainous areas
   between the northern and the southern ends of peninsular Thailand
   (similar to 7-12 degrees N, 99-102 degrees E). Activity concentrations
   of radionuclides in the samples were measured using a low background
   gamma spectrometer. The results revealed non-uniform spatial
   distributions of all the radionuclides in the study area. Principal
   component analysis and cluster analysis revealed two distinct origins
   for the studied radionuclides, and furthermore, the Pearson correlations
   were strong within Ra-226, Th-232 U-238 and K-40 as well as within
   Pb-210 and Pb-21(ex), but there was no significant correlation between
   these two groups. Also Be-7 was uncorrelated to the others, as expected
   due to different origins of the airborne and terrestrial radionuclides.
   The radionuclide activities of moss samples varied by moss species,
   topography, geology, and meteorology of each sampling area. The observed
   abnormally high concentrations of some radionuclides probably indicate
   that the concentrations of airborne and terrestrial radionuclides in
   moss samples were directly related to local geological features of the
   sampling site, or that high levels of Be-7 were most probably linked
   with topography and regional NE monsoonal winds from mainland China. (C)

Abstract = {{Desiccation-induced chlorophyll fluorescence quenching seems to be an
   indispensable part of desiccation resistance in the surveyed 28 green
   microalgal species.
   Lichens are desiccation tolerant meta-organisms. In the desiccated state
   photosynthesis is inhibited rendering the photobionts potentially
   sensitive to photoinhibition. As a photoprotective mechanism, strong
   non-radiative dissipation of absorbed light leading to quenching of
   chlorophyll fluorescence has been proposed. Desiccation-induced
   quenching affects not only variable fluorescence, but also the so-called
   basal fluorescence, F (0). This phenomenon is well-known for intact
   lichens and some free living aero-terrestrial algae, but it was often
   absent in isolated lichen algae. Therefore, a thorough screening for the
   appearance of desiccation-induced quenching was undertaken with 13
   different aero-terrestrial microalgal species and lichen photobionts.
   They were compared with 15 aquatic green microalgal species, among them
   also three marine species. We asked the following questions: Do isolated
   lichen algae show desiccation-induced quenching? Are aero-terrestrial
   algae different in this respect to aquatic algae and is the potential
   for desiccation-induced quenching coupled to desiccation tolerance? How
   variable is desiccation-induced quenching among species? Most of the
   aero-terrestrial algae, including all lichen photobionts, showed
   desiccation-induced quenching, although highly variable in extent,
   whereas most of the aquatic algae did not. All algae displaying
   quenching were also desiccation tolerant, whereas all algae unable to
   perform desiccation-induced quenching were desiccation intolerant.
   Desiccation-induced fluorescence quenching seems to be an indispensable
   part of desiccation resistance in the investigated species.}},

Abstract = {{In the Amazonian rain forest, major parts of trees and shrubs are
   covered by epiphytic cryptogams of great taxonomic variety, but their
   relevance in biosphere-atmosphere exchange, climate processes, and
   nutrient cycling is largely unknown. As cryptogams are poikilohydric
   organisms, they are physiologically active only under moist conditions.
   Thus, information on their water content (WC) as well as temperature and
   light conditions experienced by them are essential to analyze their
   impact on local, regional, and even global biogeochemical processes. In
   this study, we present data on the microclimatic conditions, including
   water content, temperature, and light conditions experienced by
   epiphytic bryophytes along a vertical gradient, and combine these with
   above-canopy climate data collected at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory
   (ATTO) in the Amazonian rain forest between October 2014 and December
   2016. While the monthly average of above-canopy light intensities
   revealed only minor fluctuations over the course of the year, the light
   intensities experienced by the bryophytes varied depending on the
   location within the canopy, probably caused by individual shading by
   vegetation. In the understory (1.5 m), monthly average light intensities
   were similar throughout the year, and individual values were extremely
   low, remaining below 3 mu mol(-1) m(-2) s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux
   density more than 84 \% of the time. Temperatures showed only minor
   variations throughout the year, with higher values and larger
   height-dependent differences during the dry season. The indirectly
   assessed water content of bryophytes varied depending on precipitation,
   air humidity, dew condensation, and bryophyte type. Whereas bryophytes
   in the canopy were affected by diel fluctuations of the relative
   humidity and condensation, those close to the forest floor mainly
   responded to rainfall patterns. In general, bryophytes growing close to
   the forest floor were limited by light availability, while those growing
   in the canopy had to withstand larger variations in microclimatic
   conditions, especially during the dry season. For further research in
   this field, these data may be combined with CO2 gas exchange
   measurements to investigate the role of bryophytes in various
   biosphere-atmosphere exchange processes, and could be a tool to
   understand the functioning of the epiphytic community in greater detail.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen (N) availability and light exposure were manipulated under

   green algal lichen Platismatia glauca.
   The lichen was fertilized with different concentrations and frequencies
   of ammonium, nitrate or glutamine under different light regimes for 2-3
   months. Responses were followed from the intact thallus to the cellular
   level.
   Despite significant differences in overall light exposure, light
   conditions were not significantly different among treatments when the
   lichens were wet and active. Ammonium was the preferred N source,
   followed by glutamine and then nitrate. Thallus N concentration as well
   as the chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration increased 3-4-fold at the
   highest ammonium concentration, while the mycobiont ergosterol
   concentration remained unaltered. Growth was significantly enhanced by
   the enhanced N supply, with the increase in dry weight varying from 3 to
   30\%. Variation in Chl a concentration explained 31\% of this variation,
   suggesting a causal link to the increased growth rate.
   Platismatia glauca responded to increased N availability by increasing
   its growth rate and carbon assimilation capacity through increased
   investments in the photobiont cells. This suggests a tight regulation of
   resource investments and metabolic pathways between the symbionts of
   this lichen.}},

Abstract = {{Despite its small size, a moss bag can reveal the different temporal and
   spatial deposition patterns of pollutants at a particular site;
   therefore, researchers can use moss bags to determine pollution sources
   and to put forward strategies for pollution control. Although the use of
   moss bags to monitor atmospheric pollution has been widely reported in
   Europe, there are few such empirical studies in China. Thus, in this
   study, bags containing the moss Sphagnum junghuhnianum were used to
   assess the concentrations of heavy metals (chromium (Cr), copper (Cu),
   lead (Pb), vanadium (V), and zinc (Zn)) at five sampling sites (four
   roads and a forest park) during the summer and winter of 2012. According
   to the relative accumulation factor (RAF) and contamination factor (CF)
   results, pollution in winter was heavier than that in summer, and Cr was
   found to be the most contaminating, having the highest mean CF. There
   was a significant positive correlation (p < 0.05) between traffic volume
   and concentration for three heavy metals (Cr, Cu, and V) in winter,
   whereas a significant positive correlation (p < 0.05) was observed
   between traffic volume and concentrations for four heavy metal elements
   (Cr, Pb, V, and Zn) in summer, indicating a close relationship between
   heavy metal contents and traffic volume. Although there was substantial
   variation in the concentrations of the five heavy metals in the moss
   bags, significant correlations between heavy metals suggested that the
   contaminants originated from a common source, namely vehicle emissions.
   The results demonstrated that the four roads were subject to different
   degrees of pollution depending on the volume of traffic using each road.
   Therefore, the results of this study suggest that traffic volume is a
   major reason for heavy metal pollution.}},

   availability}},
Journal = {{CATENA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{195-202}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Cyanobacterial soil crusts play an important role in arid ecosystems and
   in stabilising dryland soils. Such arid regions are prone to extreme
   environmental conditions such as prolonged drought and short-lived
   intense rainfall and flood events, yet the impact of such events on
   cyanobacterial growth, and hence their role in landscape stability, is
   poorly-understood. This paper presents a series of laboratory
   experiments which determine cyanobacterial soil crust response to
   moisture and nutrient availability. Photosynthetic yield measurements
   indicate a rapid response in cyanobacterial response following hydration
   and suggest moisture content >14\% (c. 1.5 mm rainfall equivalent) is
   necessary to sustain such activity. The addition of nutrients did not
   trigger any significant increase in crust metabolic activity or
   photosynthetic response compared with deionised water over a 7-day
   period. However, over longer periods (>4 weeks) nutrient-enriched
   rainfall promoted an increase in cyanobacterial metabolic growth
   measures (chlorophyll a and `greenness') compared with deionised water.
   From the results we can infer that the magnitude and frequency of
   hydration from rainfall and flood events in arid regions play an
   important role in the maintenance of cyanobacterial soil crusts.
   Predicted changes in dryland hydrological regimes, for example changing
   frequency and intensity of rainfall in the Australian arid zone as a
   consequence of climate shifts, may therefore have an impact on the
   ability of cyanobacterial crusts to promote landscape stability. (C)

Abstract = {{Recent changes in species composition, and increases in shrub abundance
   in particular, have been reported as a result of warming in Arctic
   tundra. Despite these changes, the driving factors that control
   shrubification and its future trajectory remain uncertain. Here we used
   an ecosystem model, ecosys, to mechanistically represent the processes
   controlling recent and 21st century changes in plant functional type
   using RCP8.5 climate forcing across North American Arctic tundra. Recent
   and projected warming was modeled to deepen the active layer (spatially
   averaged by similar to 0.35m by 2100) and thereby increase nutrient
   availability. Shrub productivity was modeled to increase across much of
   the tundra, particularly in Alaska and tundra-boreal ecotones. Deciduous
   and evergreen shrubs increased from similar to 45\% of total tundra
   ecosystem net primary productivity (NPP) in recent decades to similar to
   70\% by 2100. The increased canopy cover of shrubs reduced incoming
   shortwave radiation for low-lying plants, causing declines in graminoids
   NPP from a current 35\% of tundra NPP to 18\%, and declines in
   nonvascular plants from 20\% to 12\%. The faster-growing deciduous
   shrubs modeled with less efficient nutrient conservation dominated much
   of the low Arctic by 2100 where nutrient cycling became more rapid,
   while the slower-growing evergreen shrubs modeled with more efficient
   nutrient conservation dominated a wider latitudinal range that extended
   to the high Arctic where nutrient cycling remained slower. We conclude
   that high-latitude vegetation dynamics over the 21st century will depend
   strongly on soil nutrient dynamics, diversity in plant traits
   controlling nutrient uptake and conservation, and light competition.}},

   increase with the progress of succession. However, even in the latter

   the major proportion of phytomass in the later stages. However, because
   of water limitation, their net primary production was smaller than that
   of the vascular plants. The compartment model that incorporated major
   carbon pools and flows suggested that the ecosystem of the later stages
   is likely to be a net sink of carbon at least for the summer season.

Abstract = {{Biological activity in arid grasslands is strongly dependent on
   moisture. We examined gas exchange of biological soil crusts
   (biocrusts), the underlying soil biotic community, and the belowground
   respiratory activity of C-3 and C-4 grasses over 2 years in southeast
   Utah, USA. We used soil surface CO2 flux and the amount and carbon
   isotope composition (delta C-13) of soil CO2 as indicators of
   belowground and soil surface activity. Soil respiration was always below
   2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and highly responsive to soil moisture. When
   moisture was available, warm spring and summer temperature was
   associated with higher fluxes. Moisture pulses led to enhanced soil
   respiration lasting for a week or more. Biological response to rain was
   not simply dependent on the amount of rain, but also depended on
   antecedent conditions (prior moisture pulses). The short-term
   temperature sensitivity of respiration was very dynamic, showing
   enhancement within 1-2 days of rain, and diminishing each day afterward.
   Carbon uptake occurred by cyanobacterially dominated biocrusts following
   moisture pulses in fall and winter, with a maximal net carbon uptake of
   0.5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), although typically the biocrusts were a net
   carbon source. No difference was detected in the seasonal activity of
   C-3 and C-4 grasses, contrasting with studies from other arid regions
   (where warm-versus cool-season activity is important), and highlighting
   the unique biophysical environment of this cold desert. Contrary to
   other studies, the delta C-13 of belowground respiration in the rooting
   zone of each photosynthetic type did not reflect the delta C-13 of C-3
   and C-4 physiology.}},

   the middle of the day after substantial falls of snow. P. minuscula

Title = {{Intralesional corticosteroid injection as an effective treatment method
   for oral lesions: a meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{56}},
Abstract = {{Intralesional corticosteroid injection (ICSI) is known as one of the
   main methods used for treating a wide range of lesions. It also results
   in a high concentration of drugs at lesion sites, with minimal systemic
   absorption. Thus, this study aimed to provide a review of the
   intralesional corticosteroid injection (ICSI) indications in the
   treatment of oral lesions. To this end; relevant key words were searched
   in the databases of PubMcd, Google Scholar, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and
   UpToDate in the present study. Accordingly, the results of a total
   number of 62 case reports or case series articles were used in this
   study and the positive therapeutic effects of intralesional
   corticosteroid injection (ICSI) in 23 common oral lesions were reported.
   The most common type of intralesional steroid in the treatment of oral
   lesions was triamcinolone. No significant difference was also observed
   in tenns of pain in patients following the use of steroid alone or in
   combination with anesthetic agents; moreover, the reported side effects
   of this method were exceptionally rare and transient. It was concluded
   that the intralesional corticosteroid injection (ICSI) could be one of
   the effective therapeutic methods with no significant problems in many
   oral lesions such as inflammatory, inununologic, and vascular ones due
   to its higher therapeutic effects than other topical forms of steroids
   and fewer side effects than systemic corticosteroid.}},

Abstract = {{Mosses are a major component of the tundra flora in the Canadian Arctic,
   yet their use in arctic contaminant research is lacking. Biomonitoring
   of atmospheric heavy metal deposition using mosses has been extensively

   precipitation monitoring. Temporal, spatial, and habitat gradients of
   concentrations and enrichment factors of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, and Pb
   (and its stable isotopes) in mosses from Ellesmere Island are examined.
   Anthropogenically influenced concentrations of As, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn in
   samples collected in 2007 were observed. Concentrations of heavy metals
   in hydric taxa were larger than those observed in xeric or mesic taxa,
   though non-significant. Generally, heavy metal concentrations decreased
   from 1983 to 2007 in a single high arctic locality, though
   non-significant. Pb-isotope ratios were radiogenic and characteristic of
   the High Arctic Islands. Trends in high arctic moss data corresponded
   with. environmental proxies such as glacial ice cores, lake sediments,
   and atmospheric aerosols illustrating the usefulness of bryophytes as

Abstract = {{To date, no global data on carbon sequestration at the initial
   weathering phase of tephra deposits are available. To study carbon
   storage in the new volcanic deposit, tephra layers were reconstructed
   for a period of 46months. The tephra samples were collected immediately
   after eruption of Mount (Mt.) Talang on 12 April 2005, over portions of
   the Solok District in West Sumatra, Indonesia. Pot experiments were
   filled with and without soil materials and covered with the collected
   tephra. The pot experiments were conducted in a wired house. The tephra
   was applied in 0, 2.5 and 5cm depths to simulate natural tephra
   deposition. Every day 250ml of filtered water was added and allowed to
   percolate. Solid fraction from the tephra layer was collected and
   analyzed at regular intervals and primary plant succession was observed
   over a period of 4years. After 2months, blue-green algae (cyanobacteria)
   started to colonize the bare surface tephra layer to form an algae mat.
   After 16months, the surface was transformed into a green biofilm of
   lichen. Vascular plants (grasses and shrubs) started to be established
   after 2years. Total carbon (TC) content of the tephra layer was
   increased significantly from 0.19 to 1.75\% or eight times higher after
   46months of incubation. Higher TC storage was found in the 2.5cm
   compared to that of the 5.0cm tephra layer, which was reconstructed
   above the soil, with values of 1.75 and 0.89\%, respectively. On the
   contrary, lesser amount of TC was accumulated in the single tephra layer
   (without soil underneath). Between 71 and 90\% of TC was considered as
   total organic carbon (TOC). The labile organic carbon (LOC) content in
   the 2.5cm and 5.0cm of tephra layer was found to be 0.22 and 0.77\%,
   respectively, at the end of incubation. This experiment confirmed the
   potential of tephra to capture carbon from the atmosphere with the help
   of nonvascular plants and then by vascular plants and finally sink them
   in the tephra layer.}},

Abstract = {{To date, there has been an ever-increasing interest in complementary air

   networks. The present work reports the results concerning five
   biomonitoring surveys (BSs) performed in the proximity of a waste

   activity was monitored by means of both active and passive BSs based on
   three photosynthetically-active biomonitors (i.e., two epiphytic
   lichens: Pseudevernia furfuracea and Xanthoria parietina; one vascular
   plant: Robinia pseudoacacia) collected or exposed before and/or after
   the WI installation, and after a four-month period of inactivity. Hg
   concentration values observed in biomonitor samples varied according to
   the implemented species and to the status of WI plant (active vs.
   inactive). Our data demonstrate that, in the same pollution scenario, P.
   furfuracea accumulates three times more Hg than both X. parietina and R.
   pseudoacacia. The results are discussed in the context of the actual

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the biomonitoring of air in Livorno Province
   (Tuscany, Italy) using lichens for both quantitative monitoring of
   airborn metals and air quality assessment. On the basis of the possible
   sources of metal pollution in the study area, the following elements
   were analyzed: As, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, V, Zn and Hg. The small number of
   lichen species, the often stunted appearance of the specimens, and metal
   analysis revealed widespread atmospheric pollution in the study area.
   The results indicate extensive anthropic impact. The highest levels of
   contamination were recorded for Hg, Cd, Pb, and V concentrations. Good
   agreement was found between bioindication and metal concentrations in
   lichens. The impact of anthropic activities is particularly due to
   steelworks and chemical plants, combustion processes related to energy
   production and vehicle emissions. In addition to air pollution, some
   natural factors, such as climate, rocky shores or ozone, were assumed to
   affect lichen occurrence. Comparison with the Lake Orta area in northern
   Italy showed Livorno Province was more contaminated by trace elements.
   Similar contamination levels were found in another area of Tuscany,
   probably due to the geological characteristics of this region. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Renewable energy sources e.g. biofuels, are the focus of this century.
   Economically and environmental friendly production of such energies are
   the challenges that limit their usages. Microalgae is one of the most

   microalgae lipid in large scales is conditioned by increasing the lipid
   content of potential strains without losing their growth rate or by

   environmental stresses and the synergistic or antagonistic effects of
   those parameters on biomass productivity and the lipid composition. This
   study contains two main parts. In the first part, the cellular

   METHODS: A detailed literature review was undertaken to investigate the
   use of quality of life measures in oral medicine. The databases searched
   were MEDLINE (through PubMed), EMBASE, CINDHL, Web of Science Citation
   Index and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and randomised

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND The clinical role of LASER for vulvar and vaginal treatments
   in gynecology and female urology is controversial. AIMS In this best
   practice document, we propose recommendations for the use of LASER for
   gynecologic and urologic conditions such as vulvovaginal atrophy,
   urinary incontinence, vulvodynia, and lichen sclerosus based on a
   thorough literature review. MATERIALS \& METHODS This project was
   developed between January and September 2018. The development of this
   document followed the ICS White Paper Standard Operating Procedures.
   RESULTS Most of the available studies are limited by their design; for
   example they lack a control group, patients are not randomized, follow
   up is short term, series are small, LASER is not compared with standard
   treatments, and studies are industry sponsored. Due to these
   limitations, the level of evidence for the use of LASER in the treatment
   of these conditions remains low and does not allow for definitive
   recommendations for its use in routine clinical practice. Histological
   evidence is commonly reported as proof of tissue regeneration following
   LASER treatment. However, the histological changes noted can also be
   consistent with reparative changes after a thermal injury rather than
   necessarily representing regeneration or restoration of function. The
   use of LASER in women with vulvodynia or lichen sclerosus should not be
   recommended in routine clinical practice. There is no biological
   plausibility or safety data on its use on this population of women.
   DISCUSSION The available clinical studies do not present convincing data
   regarding the efficacy of LASER for the treatment of vaginal atrophy or
   urinary incontinence. Also, while short-term complications seem to be
   uncommon, data concerning long-term outcomes are lacking. CONCLUSION At
   this point, LASER is not recommended for routine treatment of the
   aforementioned conditions unless part of well-designed clinical trials
   or with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent, and
   audit.}},

Abstract = {{Current models of climate change predict a reduction of area covered by
   northern coniferous forests and tundra, and an increase in grasslands.
   These scenarios also indicate a northerly shift in agricultural regions,
   bringing virgin soils under cultivation. The direct effects of man on
   tundra, boreal forest, and temperate grassland ecosystems are likely to
   result in less carbon mobilization from soils and vegetation than from
   tropical forests. However, as a consequence of climate change, carbon
   mineralization rates from arctic and sub-arctic soils could be very
   rapid under warmer and drier conditions because of low stabilization of
   soil organic matter (SOM) and enhanced microbial responses to small
   changes in soil moisture and temperature. Predicting the response of
   these systems to climate change is complicated where the edaphic
   environment regulating SOM dynamics is not a direct function of
   macroclimatic conditions. Grasslands contain a greater proportion of
   highly stabilized SOM than coniferous forests, distributed over greater
   depth in the soil profile, which is less susceptible to changes in
   mineralization rates. It is concluded that short-term responses of soil
   processes to climate change are more predictable in well-drained
   grassland and forest soils than in waterlogged soils of the tundra and
   boreal region. Over longer periods of time, however, plant species and
   soil types will alter in response to new temperature and moisture
   regimes above- and belowground interacting with the effects of carbon
   enrichment and changes in nutrient availability. The dynamics of these
   plant-soil interactions and the future status of soils in different life
   zones as sources or sinks of carbon is poorly understood. More data are
   also needed on the distribution of waterlogged forest soils in the
   boreal zone and responses to warming, which include the production of
   methane as well as CO2. The primary recommendation for future research
   is for integrated studies on plant and soil processes.}},

Abstract = {{Field-based studies are an essential component of research addressing
   the behavior of organic chemicals, and a unique line of evidence that
   can be used to assess bioaccumulation potential in chemical registration
   programs and aid in development of associated laboratory and modeling
   efforts. To aid scientific and regulatory discourse on the application
   of terrestrial field data in this manner, this article provides
   practical recommendations regarding the generation and interpretation of
   terrestrial field data. Currently, biota-to-soil-accumulation factors
   (BSAFs), biomagnification factors (BMFs), and bioaccumulation factors
   (BAFs) are the most suitable bioaccumulation metrics that are applicable
   to bioaccumulation assessment evaluations and able to be generated from
   terrestrial field studies with relatively low uncertainty.
   Biomagnification factors calculated from field-collected samples of
   terrestrial carnivores and their prey appear to be particularly robust
   indicators of bioaccumulation potential. The use of stable isotope
   ratios for quantification of trophic relationships in terrestrial
   ecosystems needs to be further developed to resolve uncertainties
   associated with the calculation of terrestrial trophic magnification
   factors (TMFs). Sampling efforts for terrestrial field studies should
   strive for efficiency, and advice on optimization of study sample sizes,
   practical considerations for obtaining samples, selection of tissues for
   analysis, and data interpretation is provided. Although there is still
   much to be learned regarding terrestrial bioaccumulation, these
   recommendations provide some initial guidance to the present application
   of terrestrial field data as a line of evidence in the assessment of

Title = {{Chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics of the cyanobacterial lichen
   Peltigera rufescens under field conditions II. Diel and annual
   distribution of metabolic activity and possible mechanisms to avoid

Abstract = {{Photosystem IT fluorescence of the terrestrial cyanobacterial lichen
   Peltigera rufescens, together with microclimate parameters, was recorded
   continuously over a complete year at two quasi-natural growing sites in
   a xerothermic steppe formation in the Botanical Garden Wurzburg. From
   the fluorescence data, metabolically active phases of the poikilohydrous
   lichen could easily be distinguished from desiccation or frost-induced
   inactivity. According to the fluorescence signal patterns, the daily
   time courses of lichen performance could be grouped in four response
   types: (1) metabolically active (i.e., measurable quantum yield)
   throughout the day due to favourable hydration: (2) lichen active at
   dawn due to nightly rain or dew condensation with subsequent drying; (3)
   activation during the daylight hours through rain or thawing; (4) no
   photosystem II activity recognisable all day. The seasonal distribution
   of these types is analysed. Overall, the lichen remained inactivated for
   46.5\% of the total year, it was photosynthetically active in the light
   for 25.6\% and hydrated during the nights for 27.9\% of the time.
   Earlier laboratory experiments had shown that dry thalli of P. rufescens
   were not affected by high Light, but, in the hydrated state, became
   drastically photoinhibited when suddenly exposed to high light stress.
   However, no, or only minor, photoinhibition was recognisable during the
   field measurements. We calculated light receipt by the lichen in nature
   under both dry and hydrated conditions. For the longest periods of light
   stress, the lichen was well protected through desiccation. Nevertheless,
   substantial periods of time occurred when the hydrated thalli were
   exposed to high light and some form of photoprotection must have taken
   place. There was a clear correlation between light receipt and thallus
   content of certain carotenoids (especially the ratio between
   concentrations of canthaxanthin and beta-carotene) and the hypothesis is
   supported that canthaxanthin formation is involved in photoprotection.
   Experiments under controlled conditions with P. rufescens revealed a
   complex relationship between gross photosynthetic CO2 uptake and
   relative electron transport as obtained from fluorescence measurements.
   In particular, quantum yield overestimated CO2 assimilation when high
   light occurred in combination with CO2 diffusion being inhibited by
   suprasaturation of the thallus with water. Thus, we could not use the
   fluorescence data to predict carbon gain of the lichen under field
   conditions, and possible reasons are discussed.}},

Title = {{The Clinical Role of LASER for Vulvar and Vaginal Treatments in
   Gynecology and Female Urology: An ICS/ISSVD Best Practice Consensus

Abstract = {{In this best practice document, we propose recommendations for the use
   of LASER for gynecologic and urologic conditions such as vulvovaginal
   atrophy, urinary incontinence, vulvodynia, and lichen sclerosus based on
   a thorough literature review. Most of the available studies are limited
   by their design; for example, they lack a control group, patients are
   not randomized, follow-up is short term, series are small, LASER is not
   compared with standard treatments, and most studies are industry
   sponsored. Because of these limitations, the level of evidence for the
   use of LASER in the treatment of these conditions remains low and does
   not allow for definitive recommendations for its use in routine clinical
   practice. Histological evidence is commonly reported as proof of tissue
   regeneration after LASER treatment. However, the histological changes
   noted can also be consistent with reparative changes after a thermal
   injury rather than necessarily representing regeneration or restoration
   of function. The use of LASER in women with vulvodynia or lichen
   sclerosus should not be recommended in routine clinical practice. There
   is no biological plausibility or safety data on its use on this
   population of women. The available clinical studies do not present
   convincing data regarding the efficacy of LASER for the treatment of
   vaginal atrophy or urinary incontinence. Also, although short-term
   complications seem to be uncommon, data concerning long-term outcomes
   are lacking. Therefore, at this point, LASER is not recommended for
   routine treatment of the aforementioned conditions unless part of
   well-designed clinical trials or with special arrangements for clinical
   governance, consent, and audit.}},

Abstract = {Respiration and photosynthesis of the planktonic foraminifera
   Globigerinoides ruber, Orbulina universa, and Globigerinella siphonifera
   and their symbiotic algae were calculated from measured dissolved oxygen
   gradients using microelectrodes, using different temperatures in dark
   and light (250 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1)) conditions. At one temperature
   (24 degrees C) the respiration rate increased as a power function of the
   foraminiferan organic carbon mass with a 0.57 +/- 0.18 exponent. The
   effect of temperature on respiration was quantified in two ways: by
   normalizing the rates to the organic carbon mass and by normalizing the
   observed rates to a constant temperature (24 degrees C). This latter
   normalization was also used for photosynthesis. The respiration rates
   increase as a function of temperature for all species and can be
   described either with a Q(10) = 3.18 (+/- 0.27) or with an Arrhenius
   temperature of T-A = 10,293 degrees K (+/- 768 degrees K). Similar
   calculations for net photosynthesis yielded a Q(10) = 2.68 (+/- 0.36)
   and a T-A = 8766uK (+/- 1203 degrees K), and calculations for gross
   photosynthesis yielded a Q(10) = 2.76 (+/- 0.29) and a T-A = 9026
   degrees K (+/- 926 degrees K). For the species studied, the
   photosynthesis : respiration ratio varied from moderate for G.
   siphonifera (0.58) to very high (13) for O. universa. The high ratios
   indicate that photosynthesis is much higher than the carbon requirements
   for both foraminifera and symbiont growth. This excess carbon might be
   the source of organic exudates.},

Title = {Effects of elevated temperature and pCO(2) on the respiration,

Abstract = {Many reef organisms, such as the giant clams, are confronted with global
   change effects. Abnormally high seawater temperatures can lead to mass
   bleaching events and subsequent mortality, while ocean acidification may
   impact biomineralization processes. Despite its strong ecological and
   socio-economic importance, its responses to these threats still need to
   be explored. We investigated physiological responses of 4-year-old
   Tridacna maxima to realistic levels of temperature (+1.5 degrees C) and
   partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) (+800 mu atm of CO2)
   predicted for 2100 in French Polynesian lagoons during the warmer
   season. During a 65-day crossed-factorial experiment, individuals were
   exposed to two temperatures (29.2 degrees C, 30.7 degrees C) and two
   pCO(2) (430 mu atm, 1212 mu atm) conditions. The impact of each
   environmental parameter and their potential synergetic effect were
   evaluated based on respiration, biomineralization and photophysiology.
   Kinetics of thermal and/or acidification stress were evaluated by
   performing measurements at different times of exposure (29, 41, 53, 65
   days). At 30.7 degrees C, the holobiont O-2 production, symbiont
   photosynthetic yield and density were negatively impacted. High pCO(2)
   had a significant negative effect on shell growth rate, symbiont
   photosynthetic yield and density. No significant differences of the
   shell microstructure were observed between control and experimental
   conditions in the first 29 days; however, modifications (i.e.
   less-cohesive lamellae) appeared from 41 days in all temperature and
   pCO(2) conditions. No significant synergetic effect was found. Present
   thermal conditions (29.2 degrees C) appeared to be sufficiently
   stressful to induce a host acclimatization response. All these
   observations indicate that temperature and pCO(2) are both forcing
   variables affecting T. maxima's physiology and jeopardize its survival
   under environmental conditions predicted for the end of this century.},

Title = {Symbiont genotype influences holobiont response to increased temperature},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {As coral reefs face warming oceans and increased coral bleaching, a
   whitening of the coral due to loss of microalgal endosymbionts, the
   possibility of evolutionary rescue offers some hope for reef
   persistence. In tightly linked mutualisms, evolutionary rescue may occur
   through evolution of the host and/or endosymbionts. Many obligate
   mutualisms are composed of relatively small, fast-growing symbionts with
   greater potential to evolve on ecologically relevant time scales than
   their relatively large, slower growing hosts. Numerous jellyfish species
   harbor closely related endosymbiont taxa to other cnidarian species such
   as coral, and are commonly used as a model system for investigating
   cnidarian mutualisms. We examined the potential for adaptation of the
   upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea xamachana to increased temperature via
   evolution of its microalgal endosymbiont, Symbiodinium microadriaticum.
   We quantified trait variation among five algal genotypes in response to
   three temperatures (26 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 32 degrees C) and
   fitness of hosts infected with each genotype. All genotypes showed
   positive growth rates at each temperature, but rates of respiration and
   photosynthesis decreased with increased temperature. Responses varied
   among genotypes but were unrelated to genetic similarity. The effect of
   temperature on asexual reproduction and the timing of development in the
   host also depended on the genotype of the symbiont. Natural selection
   could favor different algal genotypes at different temperatures,
   affecting host fitness. This eco-evolutionary interaction may be a
   critical component of understanding species resilience in increasingly
   stressful environments.},

Title = {Oxygen Metabolic Responses of Three Species of Large Benthic
   Foraminifers with Algal Symbionts to Temperature Stress},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 3},
Abstract = {Water temperature affects the physiology of large benthic foraminifers
   (LBFs) with algal symbionts dwelling in coral reef environments.
   However, the detailed physiological responses of LBF holobionts to
   temperature ranges occurring in their habitats are not known. We report
   net oxygen (O-2) production and respiration rates of three LBF
   holobionts (Baculogypsina sphaerulata and Calcarina gaudichaudii hosting
   diatom symbionts, and Amphisorus kudakajimensis hosting dinoflagellate
   symbionts) measured in the laboratory at water temperatures ranging from
   5 degrees C to 45 degrees C in 2.5 degrees C or 5 degrees C intervals
   and with light saturation levels of similar to 500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1).
   In addition, the recovery of net O-2 production and respiration rates
   after exposure to temperature stress was assessed. The net O-2
   production and respiration rates of the three LBF holobionts peaked at
   similar to 30 degrees C, indicating their optimal temperature for a
   short exposure period. At extreme high temperatures (>= 40 degrees C),
   the net O-2 production rates of all three LBF holobionts declined to
   less than zero and the respiration rates slightly decreased, indicating
   that photosynthesis of algal symbionts was inactivated. At extreme low
   temperatures (<= 10 degrees C for two calcarinid species and <= 5
   degrees C for A. kudakajimensis), the net O-2 production and respiration
   rates were near zero, indicating a weakening of holobiont activity.
   After exposure to extreme high or low temperature, the net O-2
   production rates did not recover until the following day, whereas the
   respiration rates recovered rapidly, suggesting that a longer time
   (days) is required for recovery from damage to the photosystem by
   temperature stress compared to the respiration system. These results
   indicate that the oxygen metabolism of LBF holobionts can generally cope
   well with conditions that fluctuate diurnally and seasonally in their
   habitats. However, temporal heat and cold stresses with high light
   levels may induce severe damage to algal symbionts and also damage to
   host foraminifers.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In many cases, understanding species' responses to climate change
   requires understanding variation among individuals in response to such
   change. For species with strong symbiotic relationships, such as many
   coral reef species, genetic variation in symbiont responses to
   temperature may affect the response to increased ocean temperatures. To
   assess variation among symbiont genotypes, we examined the population
   dynamics and physiological responses of genotypes of Breviolum
   antillogorgium in response to increased temperature. We found broad
   temperature tolerance across genotypes, with all genotypes showing
   positive growth at 26, 30, and 32 degrees C. Genotypes differed in the
   magnitude of the response of growth rate and carrying capacity to
   increasing temperature, suggesting that natural selection could favor
   different genotypes at different temperatures. However, the historical
   temperature at which genotypes were reared (26 or 30 degrees C) was not
   a good predictor of contemporary temperature response. We found
   increased photosynthetic rates and decreased respiration rates with
   increasing contemporary temperature, and differences in physiology among
   genotypes, but found no significant differences in the response of these
   traits to temperature among genotypes. In species with such broad
   thermal tolerance, selection experiments on symbionts outside of the
   host may not yield results sufficient for evolutionary rescue from
   climate change.},

Abstract = {Adaptation, acclimatization and symbiont diversity are known to regulate
   thermal tolerance in corals, but the role of these mechanisms remains
   poorly constrained in other photosymbioses, such as large benthic
   foraminifera (LBFs), which are known to bleach at temperatures that are
   likely to be exceeded in the near future. LBFs inhabit a broad range of
   shallow-water settings. Within species, differences in thermal tolerance
   have been found among populations from different habitats, but it is not
   clear whether such differences occur among LBFs inhabiting similar
   habitats, but differing in other aspects, such as symbiont type. To this
   end, we compared responses to thermal stress in specimens from a
   population of Amphistegina lessonii, an abundant Indo-Pacific species,
   to specimens of Amphistegina gibbosa, its Atlantic counter-part, from a
   similar environment but two different water depths (5 and 18 m). Test
   groups of each species were exposed in a common experiment to three
   thermal stress scenarios over a four-week period. Growth, respiration,
   mortality and motility were measured to characterize the holobiont
   response. Coloration, photosynthesis and chlorophyll a content were
   measured to determine the response of the endosymbiotic diatoms. The
   photosymbionts were characterized by genetic fingerprinting. Our results
   show that, although groups of A. gibbosa were collected from different
   habitats, their responses were similar, indicating only marginally
   higher tolerance to thermal peaks in specimens from the shallower site.
   In contrast, species-specific differences were stronger, with A.
   lessonii showing higher tolerance to episodic stress and less pronounced
   impacts of chronic stress on motility, growth and photosymbiont
   performance. These interspecies variations are consistent with the
   presence of different and more diverse symbiont assemblages in A.
   lessonii compared with A. gibbosa. This study demonstrates the
   importance of considering symbiont diversity in the assessment of infra-
   and interspecific variations in stress responses in LBFs.},

Journal = {PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH},

Volume = {143},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Lichens are a symbiosis between a fungus and one or more photosynthetic
   microorganisms that enables the symbionts to thrive in places and
   conditions they could not compete independently. Exchanges of water and
   sugars between the symbionts are the established mechanisms that support
   lichen symbiosis. Herein, we present a new linkage between algal
   photosynthesis and fungal respiration in lichen Flavoparmelia caperata
   that extends the physiological nature of symbiotic co-dependent
   metabolisms, mutually boosting energy conversion rates in both
   symbionts. Measurements of electron transport by oximetry show that
   photosynthetic O-2 is consumed internally by fungal respiration. At low
   light intensity, very low levels of O-2 are released, while
   photosynthetic electron transport from water oxidation is normal as
   shown by intrinsic chlorophyll variable fluorescence yield (period-4
   oscillations in flash-induced Fv/Fm). The rate of algal O-2 production
   increases following consecutive series of illumination periods, at low
   and with limited saturation at high light intensities, in contrast to
   light saturation in free-living algae. We attribute this effect to arise
   from the availability of more CO2 produced by fungal respiration of
   photosynthetically generated sugars. We conclude that the lichen
   symbionts are metabolically coupled by energy conversion through
   exchange of terminal electron donors and acceptors used in both
   photosynthesis and fungal respiration. Algal sugars and O-2 are consumed
   by the fungal symbiont, while fungal delivered CO2 is consumed by the
   alga.},

Abstract = {The Mg/Ca composition of calcium carbonate tests (shells) secreted by
   planktonic foraminifera is increasingly being employed to estimate past
   seawater temperatures and reconstruct paleocean and climate records
   spanning hundreds of thousands of years. We show, using two
   high-resolution microanalysis techniques, that the final chamber of the
   planktonic foraminifera Orbulina universa typically comprises between
   three and six paired, low and high Mg, growth bands. The number and
   spacing of these bands is consistent with a diurnal origin, modulated by
   changing pH within the foraminiferal microenvironment due to the
   day-night, photosynthesis-respiration cycle of algal symbionts. The
   amplitude of Mg/Ca variation within individual tests and across many
   daily growth bands cannot be accounted for by seawater temperature in
   the shallow, euphotic zone habitat of O. universa. Our results indicate
   the Mg/Ca composition of calcite precipitated by O. universa in nature
   is strongly influenced by diurnal changes in the biological activity of
   algal symbionts and the host foraminifer. This brings into question the
   fundamental premise often made in applying Mg/Ca palaeoseawater
   thermometry, that the Mg/Ca composition of foraminiferal calcite is
   determined by seawater temperature, and whether the Mg/Ca composition of
   other planktonic species that are more widely used for palaeoseawater
   thermometry are subject to similar influences. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Effects of grazing exclusion on soil respiration components in an alpine
   meadow on the north-eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau},
Journal = {CATENA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {194},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Grazing exclusion has been widely used to restore degraded grasslands
   worldwide. Total soil respiration (Rs) (consisting of heterotrophic
   respiration (Rh, microbes and soil fauna respiration) and autotrophic
   respiration (Ra, plant root and their symbionts respiration)) play a
   critical role in the global carbon (C) balance. Quantifying Rs, Rh and
   Ra in relation to different grazing exclusion durations is vital to
   better understanding the impact of grassland management on global C
   cycling. However, how Rs and its components respond to different grazing
   exclusion durations remain unclear. Therefore, in this study, a
   trenching method was used to separate the Ra and Rh in an alpine meadow
   with different grazing exclusion durations (0, 4, 7, 10 and 12 years) on
   the north-eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Our results demonstrated that
   the growing season Rs, Rh and Ra showed nonlinear (hump-shaped) response
   patterns with the length of grazing exclusion, with a peak point at the
   7-year grazing exclusion. Meanwhile, grazing exclusion treatments
   significantly increased the Rs, Rh and Ra compared to the grazed site.
   Grazing exclusion substantially increased the soil respiration
   temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) values of Rs, Rh and Ra. Moreover, the
   Q(10) values of Ra and Rh showed hump-shaped response patterns with the
   length of grazing exclusion, with a threshold of 7 years grazing
   exclusion. The annual Ra/Rs ratio ranged from 53\% to 69\% during the
   growing season, indicating that changes in soil respiration were mainly
   determined by changes in autotrophic respiration. In addition, soil
   temperature could better explain Rh (R-2 = 0.89-0.94) than Ra (R-2 =
   0.84-0.9). Our research highlights the nonlinear response of Rs, Rh and
   Ra to the length of grazing exclusion, and suggests that different
   grazing exclusion durations should be considered for better evaluating
   the impact of grassland management on global C cycling on the
   north-eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.},

Abstract = {Perturbed colonies of Phenganax parrini and Sarcothelia sp. exhibit
   migration of symbionts of Symbiodinium spp. into the stolons.
   Densitometry and visual inspection indicated that polyps bleached while
   stolons did not. When migration was triggered by temperature, light and
   confinement, colonies of Sarcothelia sp. decreased rates of oxygen
   formation in the light (due to the effects of perturbation on
   photosynthesis and respiration) and increased rates of oxygen uptake in
   the dark (due to the effects of perturbation on respiration alone).
   Colonies of P. parrini, by contrast, showed no significant changes in
   either aspect of oxygen metabolism. When migration was triggered by
   light and confinement, colonies of Sarcothelia sp. showed decreased
   rates of oxygen formation in the light and increased rates of oxygen
   uptake in the dark, while colonies of P. parrini maintained the former
   and increased the latter. During symbiont migration into their stolons,
   colonies of both species showed dramatic increases in reactive oxygen
   species (ROS), as visualized with a fluorescent probe, with stolons of
   Sarcothelia sp. exhibiting a nearly immediate increase of ROS.
   Differences in symbiont type may explain the greater sensitivity of
   colonies of Sarcothelia sp. Using fluorescent probes, direct
   measurements of migrating symbionts in the stolons of Sarcothelia sp.
   showed higher levels of reactive nitrogen species and lower levels of
   ROS than the surrounding host tissue. As measured by native
   fluorescence, levels of NAD(P) H in the stolons were unaffected by
   perturbation. Symbiont migration thus correlates with dramatic
   physiological changes and may serve as a marker for coral condition.},

Abstract = {Collodaria (Retaria) are important contributors to planktonic
   communities and biogeochemical processes (e.g., the biologic pump) in
   oligotrophic oceans. Similarly to corals, Collodaria live in symbiosis
   with dinoflagellate algae, a relationship that is thought to explain
   partly their ecological success. In the context of global change, the
   robustness of the symbiotic interaction, and potential subsequent
   bleaching events are of primary interest for oceanic ecosystems
   functioning. In the present study, we compared the ultrastructure,
   morphology, symbiont density, photosynthetic capacities and respiration
   rates of colonial Collodaria exposed to a range of temperatures
   corresponding to natural conditions (21 degrees C), moderate (25 degrees
   C), and high (28 degrees C) thermal stress. We showed that symbiont
   density immediately decreased when temperature rose to 25 degrees C,
   while the overall Collodaria holobiont metabolic activity increased.
   When temperature reached 28 degrees C, the holobiont respiration nearly

Abstract = {Elevated temperatures and nutrients are degrading coral reef ecosystems,
   but the understanding of how early life stages of reef corals respond to
   these stressors remains limited. Here, we test the impact of temperature
   (mean similar to 27 degrees C vs. similar to 29 degrees C) and nitrate
   and phosphate enrichment (ambient, + 5 mu M nitrate, + 1 mu M phosphate
   and combined + 5 mu M nitrate with 1 mu M phosphate) on coral larvae
   using three Hawaiian coral species with different modes of symbiont
   transmission and reproduction: Lobactis scutaria (horizontal, gonochoric
   broadcast spawner), Pocillopora acuta (vertical, hermaphroditic brooder)
   and Montipora capitata (vertical, hermaphroditic broadcast spawner).
   Temperature and nutrient effects were species specific and appear
   antagonistic for L. scutaria and M. capitata, but not for P. acuta.
   Larvae survivorship in all species was lowest under nitrate enrichment
   at 27 degrees C. M. capitata and L. scutaria survivorship increased at
   29 degrees C. However, positive effects of warming on survivorship were
   lost under high nitrate, but phosphate attenuated nitrate effects when
   N/P ratios were balanced. P. acuta larvae exhibited high survivorship (>
   91\%) in all treatments and showed little change in larval size, but
   lower respiration rates at 29 degrees C. Elevated nutrients (+N+P) led
   to the greatest loss in larvae size for aposymbiotic L. scutaria, while
   positive growth in symbiotic M. capitata larvae was reduced under
   warming and highest in +N+P treatments. Overall, we report a greater
   sensitivity of broadcast spawners to warming and nutrient changes
   compared to a brooding coral species. These results suggest variability
   in biological responses to warming and nutrient enrichment is influenced
   by life-history traits, including the presence of symbionts (vertical
   transmission), in addition to nutrient type and nutrient stoichiometry.},

Journal = {MARINE MICROPALEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Pages = {31-44},

Abstract = {Minor and trace elements in foraminiferal carbonates are potential
   paleo-proxies of climate, nutrient and seawater composition. There are
   very few reports of trace element composition of symbiont-bearing,
   larger foraminifera that are known to be important constituents of
   shallow-marine, modem and ancient carbonates. In this paper we examine
   the range of variation in Mg and Sr content of Recent species of these
   foraminifera from a lagoon of Lakshadweep Atoll (Indian Ocean) and
   Akajima Islands, Japan. Two hyaline species, Amphistegina lessonii and
   Neorotalia calcar,and two porcellaneous species, Antphisorus hentprichii
   and Marginopora vertebralis were collected live from Lakshadweep
   islands. Mg/Ca in these foraminifera is of an order of magnitude higher
   than the values reported for planktonic and symbiont-free benthic
   foraminifera. The Sr/Ca values are, however, comparable with the
   reported values in other foraminiferal taxa and they are found to vary
   within a narrow range. Electron-probe micro-analysis of three
   symbiont-bearing benthic species indicates spatial heterogeneity of high
   orders in Mg/Ca composition in all the species. The annual variation in
   temperature and pH of the lagoon water cannot explain the observed
   amplitude of the compositional variation. The photosynthesis and
   respiration of the symbionts and host foraminifera are possibly the
   major cause of compositional heterogeneity in individual tests, as has
   also been recently postulated for symbiont-bearing planktonic
   foraminiferal species. It highlights the need to isolate biological
   factors and necessitates species-specific paleotemperature scale in
   paleoclimatic analysis. We also analyzed delta O-18, delta C-13, Ca, Mg
   and Sr in carefully dissected chambers of a reef-dwelling, porcellaneous
   benthic foraminifer, Marginopora kudakajimaensis, collected live in four
   seasons. A moderate positive correlation is observed between Mg/Ca and
   temperature. However, large inter- and intra-test variation in Mg limits
   the precision of Mg/Ca as palaeotemperature proxy. The Sr/Ca of the test
   calcite is unrelated to temperature of the sea water. The delta C-13 of
   M. kudakajiniaensis does not correlate with delta O-18, Mg/Ca or Sr/Ca.

Abstract = {This study experimentally investigated the effect of an early summer
   short-term summer thermal anomaly in November on Heron Reef (Great
   Barrier Reef), on the performance of the coral-algal symbiosis during a
   subsequent, thermally induced bleaching event (defined by loss of
   symbionts) in February 2009. Fragments of the reef flat coral, Acropora
   millepora, exposed to the two heating events lost 78\% of their
   symbionts and showed a 64\% decline in dark adapted quantum yield
   (Fv/Fm) to values less than 0.25. Whereas corals that were only heated
   in the second event lost 57\% symbionts and displayed a 75\% decline in
   Fv/Fm to values less than 0.2. Coral in both pre-stressed and non
   pre-stressed treatments at 34 degrees C had net photosynthetic rates
   significantly less than zero (P-net max<0), suggesting that daytime O-2
   respiration rates were significantly greater than rates of O-2 evolution
   through photosynthesis. Increases in the daily light field and/or
   increases in temperature led to the observation of dark-adapted
   xanthophyll de-epoxidation suggesting that the potential for
   non-photochemical quenching is maintained into the dark (after 1 h dark
   adaption). Pre-stressed corals were also found to have de-epoxidation
   ratios three times greater than non pre-stressed corals at 34 degrees C
   and xanthophyll pool to Chl a, much greater than non pre-stressed
   corals. Combined, these results indicate that symbionts in pre-stressed
   corals have a greater ability to dump incoming light energy as heat We
   conclude that whilst differences were observed between pre-stressed and
   non pre-stressed populations in measurements of photosynthetic
   productivity, photosynthetic pigments and areal protein, thermal
   bleaching as defined by symbiont loss did not vary between treatments.

   compromised bioenergetic pathways (e.g. cellular respiration and

   cellular components causing the dysregulation of cellular homeostasis
   and the breakdown of symbiosis. In this review, we synthesize the

Abstract = {The intertidal sea anemone Anthopleura egantissima contains two
   symbiotic algae, zoochlorellae and zooxanthellae, in the Northern Puget
   Sound region. Possible nutritional advantages to hosting one algal
   symbiont over the other were explored by comparing the photosynthetic
   and carbon translocation rates of both symbionts under different
   environmental conditions. Each alga translocated 30\% of
   photosynthetically fixed carbon in freshly collected anemones, although
   zoochlorellae fixed and translocated less carbon than zooxanthellae. The
   total amount of carbon translocated to the host was equivalent because
   densities of zoochlorellae were two to three times greater than were
   densities of zooxanthellae. In A. elegantissima maintained under high
   and low irradiance (100 and 10 mu mol photons/m(2)/s) at 20 degrees C
   and 13 degrees C for 21 days, bath algae fixed and translocated carbon
   at greater rates at 20 degrees C (translocation rates: 0,38 pg C

   /zooxanthella/h), However, zoochlorellate anemones received 3.5 times
   less carbon at 20 degrees C than at 13 degrees C because the higher
   temperature caused a significant reduction in the density of
   zoochlorellae. Environmental variables, Like temperature, that influence
   the densities of the two symbionts will affect their relative
   nutritional contribution to the host. Whether these differences in
   carbon translocation rates of the two algal symbionts affect the ecology
   of their anemone host awaits further investigation.},

Abstract = {The association between the symbiont Symbiodinium microadriaticum
   (zooxanthellae) and its host jellyfish, Cassiopea xamachana, was
   investigated as a function of jellyfish size and season. Symbiont cell
   diameter and volume were higher during January than September. Although
   zooxanthella-specific chlorophyll was independent of jellyfish size,
   both chlorophyll a and c were higher during January. Regardless of
   season, algal density and jellyfish size were inversely related. The
   diel mitotic index (MI) of zooxanthellae was phased, with a peak of
   0.25\% occurring between 09:00 and 12:00 h. September photosynthetic
   rates were always higher than January rates and reflected the seasonal
   light and temperature regimes at the latitude of the Florida Keys (USA).
   Photosynthesis, when normalized to either zooxanthella density or
   protein, displayed an inverse relationship with jellyfish size. Medusan
   respiration rates also showed an inverse relationship with jellyfish
   size, with September metabolism being higher than that of January. The
   carbon budgets calculated for these medusae indicate that the carbon
   photosynthetically fixed by the zooxanthellae, and subsequently
   translocated to the host, is capable of satisfying about 169\% of the
   host's metabolic demand (CZAR) and is independent of both jellyfish size
   and season. These seasonally influenced physiological effects underscore
   the necessity for seasonal examinations of algal-cnidarian symbioses in
   order to understand the photophysiology of the association on an annual

Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {543-552},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A terminal electron acceptor alternative to mitochondrial cytochrome c
   oxidase (COX), mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX), is ubiquitous in
   higher plants and represented in nearly every algal taxon but is poorly
   documented in dinoflagellates. AOX competes for electrons with the
   conventional COX and has been hypothesized to function as a means of
   reducing oxidative stress in mitochondria, as well as a potential
   mechanism for ameliorating thermal and other physiological stressors.
   Here, the presence of an active AOX in cultured Symbiodinium was assayed
   by the response of oxygen consumption to the AOX inhibitor
   salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) and the COX inhibitor cyanide (CN).
   CN-insensitive, SHAM-sensitive oxygen consumption was found to account
   for a large portion (26 \%) of Symbiodinium dark respiration and is
   consistent with high levels of AOX activity. This experimental evidence
   of the existence of a previously unreported terminal oxidase was further
   corroborated by analysis of publicly available Symbiodinium
   transcriptome data. The potential for enhanced AOX expression to play a
   compensatory role in mediating thermal stress was supported by inhibitor
   assays of cultured Symbiodinium at low (18 A degrees C), moderate (26 A
   degrees C), and high (32 A degrees C) temperature conditions. Maximum
   capacity of the putative AOX pathway as a proportion of total dark
   oxygen consumption was found to increase from 26 \% at 26 A degrees C to
   45 \% and 53 \% at 18 A degrees C and 32 A degrees C, respectively, when
   cells were acclimated to the treatment temperatures. Cells assayed at 18
   and 32 A degrees C without acclimation exhibited either the same or
   lower AOX capacity as controls, suggesting that the AOX protein is
   upregulated under temperature stress. The physiological implications for
   the presence of AOX in the coral/algal symbiosis and its potential role
   in response to many forms of biotic and abiotic stress, particularly
   oxidative stress, are discussed.},

Abstract = {The sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima hosts two phylogenetically
   different symbiotic microalgae, a dinoflagellate Symbiodinium
   (zooxanthellae, ZX) and a chlorophyte (zoochlorellae, ZC). The
   photosynthetic productivity (P), respiration (R), and contribution of
   algal carbon translocated to the host (CZAR) in response to a year's
   seasonal ambient changes of natural light and temperature are documented
   for both ZX- and ZC-bearing anemones. Light and temperature both affect
   photosynthesis, respiration, and CZAR, as well as various algal
   parameters; while there are evident seasonal differences, for the most
   part the relative effects on P, R, and CZAR by the two environmental
   variables cannot be determined. Net photosynthesis (P-n) of both ZX and
   ZC was significantly higher during spring and summer. During these
   seasons, the P-n of ZX was always greater than that of ZC. Regardless of
   algal symbiont, anemone respiration (R) was significantly higher during
   the spring and summer. The annual net carbon fixation rate of anemones
   with ZX and ZC was 325 and 276 mg C anemone(-1) year(-1), respectively,
   which translates to annual net community productivity rates of 92 and 60
   g C m(-1) year(-1) for anemones with ZX or ZC, respectively. CZAR did
   not show a clear relationship with season; however the CZAR for ZX was
   always significantly greater than for ZC. Lower ZX growth rates, coupled
   with higher photosynthetic rates and higher CZAR estimates, compared to
   ZC, suggest that if A. elegantissima is simply carbon limited,
   ZX-bearing anemones should be the dominant symbiont in the field.
   However ZC-bearing anemones persist in low light and reduced temperature
   microhabitats, therefore more than the translocation of carbon from ZC
   must be involved. Given that global climate change will increase water
   temperatures, the potential for latitudinal range shifts of both ZC and
   ZX (S. californium and muscatinei) might be used as biological
   indicators of thermal shifts in the littoral zone of the Pacific
   Northwest.},

   in RS within a host species was explained by ECM root tip N
   concentrations. This may indicate that some of the variability in fine
   root RS-N relationships observed between and within different host
   species or their functional groups may be related to intraspecific host
   species differences in root tip N concentration among ECM fungal

Abstract = {Foraminifera are the most important source of information for
   oceanographic and climatic reconstruction on glacial-interglacial as
   well as on much longer time-scales. The information is contained in the
   chemical composition, especially the isotopic ratios, of the calcitic
   shells (e.g., delta(11)B, delta(13)C, delta(18)O). Based on the
   assumption that our understanding of the major parameters controlling
   stable isotope incorporation is complete, these geochemical proxies have
   been used to reconstruct glacial ice volumes, sea surface and deep water
   temperatures, ocean circulation changes and shifts between carbon
   reservoirs. However, recent laboratory experiments have demonstrated
   that the delta(13)C and delta(18)O are not only strongly dependent on
   the carbonate chemistry of the culture medium but that the sc-called
   `vital-effects' are probably mediated via perturbations of the local
   carbonate system. These findings have an important impact on the
   interpretation of isotope data. For instance, the carbonate system of
   the glacial ocean was quite different from that of the Holocene and
   since the onset of the industrial revolution the carbonate chemistry of
   the surface water must have changed drastically. As a first step towards
   a better understanding of the isotopic fractionation processes we
   present results of a diffusion-reaction model of the carbonate system
   (CO2, HCO3-, CO32-, H+, OH-, B(OH)(3), B(OH)(4)(-)) in the
   microenvironment (the diffusive boundary layer) of living planktic
   foraminifera. The carbon fluxes associated with the main life processes
   (calcification, respiration and symbiont photosynthesis) lead to
   substantial perturbations in pH and significant shifts in the
   concentrations of CO2, CO32- and other components in the vicinity of the
   foraminifer. Consequently, the carbonate chemistry of the ambient
   environment is quite different from that of the bulk sea water.
   Comparison with pH-microelectrode measurements confirm our numerical
   results. Our results further demonstrate that the symbionts must use
   bicarbonate as an additional carbon source for photosynthesis as the
   calculated CO2 fluxes are not sufficient to support measured rates of
   oxygen evolution. The simulations also show that for the fast
   calcification of Globigerinoides sacculifer the supply of carbonate ions
   is insufficient and therefore use of bicarbonate or an internal pool for
   carbon is required, whereas no such pool is necessary for the much
   slower calcification in Orbulina universa. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {Understanding how rising seawater pCO(2) and temperatures impact coral
   aragonite accretion is essential for predicting the future of reef
   ecosystems. Here, we report 2 long-term (10-11 month) studies assessing
   the effects of temperature (25 and 28 degrees C) and both high and low
   seawater pCO(2) (180-750 mu atm) on the calcification, photosynthesis
   and respiration of individual massive Porites spp. genotypes.
   Calcification rates were highly variable between genotypes, but high
   seawater pCO(2) reduced calcification significantly in 4 of 7 genotypes
   cultured at 25 degrees C but in only 1 of 4 genotypes cultured at 28
   degrees C. Increasing seawater temperature enhanced calcification in
   almost all corals, but the magnitude of this effect was seawater pCO(2)
   dependent. The 3 degrees C temperature increase enhanced calcification
   rate on average by 3\% at 180 mu atm, by 35\% at 260 mu atm and by >
   300\% at 750 mu atm. The rate increase at high seawater pCO(2) exceeds
   that observed in inorganic aragonites. Responses of gross/net
   photosynthesis and respiration to temperature and seawater pCO(2) varied
   between genotypes, but rates of all these processes were reduced at the
   higher seawater temperature. Increases in seawater temperature, below
   the thermal stress threshold, may mitigate against ocean acidification
   in this coral genus, but this moderation is not mediated by an increase
   in net photosynthesis. The response of coral calcification to
   temperature cannot be explained by symbiont productivity or by
   thermodynamic and kinetic influences on aragonite formation.},

Title = {Can Antarctic lichens acclimatize to changes in temperature?},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1123-1135},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Antarctic Peninsula, a tundra biome dominated by lichens and
   bryophytes, is an ecozone undergoing rapid temperature shifts. Such
   changes may demand a high physiological plasticity of the local lichen
   species to maintain their role as key drivers in this pristine habitat.
   This study examines the response of net photosynthesis and respiration
   to increasing temperatures for three Antarctic lichen species with
   different ecological response amplitudes. We hypothesize that negative
   effects caused by increased temperatures can be mitigated by thermal
   acclimation of respiration and/or photosynthesis. The fully controlled
   growth chamber experiment simulated intermediate and extreme temperature
   increases over the time course of 6 weeks. Results showed that, in
   contrast to our hypothesis, none of the species was able to
   down-regulate temperature-driven respiratory losses through thermal
   acclimation of respiration. Instead, severe effects on photobiont
   vitality demonstrated that temperatures around 15 degrees C mark the
   upper limit for the two species restricted to the Antarctic, and when
   mycobiont demands exceeded the photobiont capacity they could not
   survive within the lichen thallus. In contrast, the widespread lichen
   species was able to recover its homoeostasis by rapidly increasing net
   photosynthesis. We conclude that to understand the complete lichen
   response, acclimation processes of both symbionts, the photo- and the
   mycobiont, have to be evaluated separately. As a result, we postulate
   that any acclimation processes in lichen are species-specific. This,
   together with the high degree of response variability and sensitivity to
   temperature in different species that co-occur spatially close,
   complicates any predictions regarding future community composition in
   the Antarctic. Nevertheless, our results suggest that species with a
   broad ecological amplitude may be favoured with on-going changes in
   temperature.},

Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Throughout its geographic range, the temperate-zone anemone Anthopleura
   elegantissima is the host of one or both of two distinctively different
   symbiotic microalgae: a dinoflagellate Symbiodinium (zooxanthellae, ZX)
   and a chlorophyte (zoochlorellae, ZC). Given the broad vertical
   intertidal and latitudinal range of this anemone, we investigated the
   role of temperature in determining whether A. elegantissima supports one
   algal symbiont over the other and whether temperature regulates the
   observed distributions of natural populations of ZX and ZC. Temperature
   appears to be a key factor in regulating both the photophysiology and
   metabolism of this algal-cnidarian association. In anemones containing
   ZX, neither algal densities nor chlorophyll content varied with
   temperature (6-24.degreesC); in contrast, anemones with ZC displayed
   reduced densities and chlorophyll content at the highest temperature
   treatment (24 degreesC). Both. ZX and ZC photosynthetic rates were
   directly related to temperature, as were anemone respiration rates. The
   higher photosynthetic rates, maintenance of a stable algal density and
   chlorophyll content, and higher potential contribution of algal carbon
   toward animal respiration (CZAR) suggest that the ZX are the more viable
   symbiont as temperature increases, but we suggest alternative reasons
   why ZC are preserved in this symbiotic association. Elevated
   temperatures reduce ZC densities and chlorophyll, suggesting that higher
   temperatures affect this relationship in a negative fashion, presumably
   due to a higher cost of maintaining ZC by the association;
   alternatively, these costs may be affiliated with the deterioration of
   the ZC themselves. These results suggest that temperature may be one of
   the most significant environmental parameters that sets the intertidal
   microhabitat and latitudinal distribution patterns of the two algal taxa
   observed in the field.},

Abstract = {Algal symbiont-bearing benthic foraminifera are producers of both
   organic and inorganic carbon in coral-reef ecosystems. However, their
   contribution to the total budget of reef carbon production has not been
   adequately quantified. We used O-2-respirometry and alkalinity-anomaly
   techniques to estimate the organic and inorganic carbon production rates
   of three species of symbiont-bearing large foraminifera common to coral
   reef flats in the northwest Pacific Ocean. The species studied were
   Baculogypsina sphaerulata and Calearina gaudichaudii, which both harbor
   diatom endosymbionts, and Marginopora kudakajimensis, which harbors
   dinoflagellate endosymbionts. Live mature individuals were placed onto
   mesh in clear airtight containers filled with filtered seawater. The
   containers were incubated for several hours at a constant temperature
   and subjected to different levels of light intensity. Seawater was
   continuously mixed throughout the experiment. Dissolved oxygen, pH and
   total alkalinity were measured before and after incubation. Three
   species of larger benthic foraminifera were net organic and inorganic
   carbon producers. The P/R ratio exceeded 1 for all species. No
   photoinhibition was observed up to 1500 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), and
   calcification was enhanced by light. These findings suggest that the
   three species are net carbon producers adapted to high-light, reef-flat
   environments. In addition, we calculated that Baculogypsina sphaerulata
   and C. gaudichaudii together accounted for 2-7.5\% of the gross primary
   production of a reef-crest community, whereas M. kudakajimensis supplied
   1-11\% of the gross primary production of a backreef community. The two
   calcarinids and M. kudakajimensis contributed similar to 1 and 10\% of
   the inorganic carbon production of seaward reef flat and protected
   lagoon communities, respectively. Together with previous reports, these
   estimates suggest that algal symbiont-bearing foraminifera play a minor
   but essential role in the organic and inorganic carbon production of
   coral-reef ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Marine ecosystems, particularly coastal environments, are rapidly
   changing due to anthropogenic impacts resulting in increased global
   climate change (ocean warming), ocean acidification, hypoxia, and
   eutrophication. On coral reefs, symbiont-bearing large benthic
   foraminifera (LBFs) can play a key role as reef constituents and
   carbonate producers, contributing up to 5\% of reef-scale carbonate
   budgets. However, projected climate change, particularly ocean warming,
   has the potential to significantly alter the conditions in which marine
   organisms persist. While the response of LBFs to elevated thermal stress
   is well documented in laboratory studies, the potential influence of
   adaptation or acclimatization through prior environmental thermal
   history on this response remains largely unknown. In this study,
   specimens of Calcarina gaudichaudii, an LBF from the Penghu Islands,
   Taiwan, were collected from thermally variable intertidal and thermally
   stable subtidal (similar to 6 m depth) environments representing thermal
   history. LBFs were then acclimated to laboratory conditions at ambient
   (25 degrees C) and elevated (28 degrees C) temperatures for three weeks,
   and subsequently exposed to control and heat stress treatments (25
   degrees C, 28 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 33 degrees C) for an additional
   one week. Photosynthetic rates (determined through oxygen flux
   measurements) of C. gaudichaudii significantly decreased in specimens
   collected at subtidal depths acclimated at 25 degrees C when compared to
   those acclimated at 28 degrees C, whereas there was no effect of thermal
   history on respiration, indicating that symbiont and holobiont responses
   may differ in LBFs. Additionally, maximum photochemical efficiency
   (Fv/Fm) significantly decreased as a result of heat stress, although
   bleaching was not visually observed after one week. These results
   highlight the plastic responses of the algal microbiome and indicate
   that thermal history, acclimatization temperature, and heat stress
   interact to affect the physiological status of C. gaudichaudii. This
   study adds to the growing literature which highlights the larger
   implications of understanding thermal history as an important factor to
   consider to better understand how ecosystem processes (e.g., carbonate
   production) are altered on modern coral reefs.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are endangered by constantly rising water temperature due to
   global warming. This triggers a breakdown of the nutritional symbiosis
   between cnidarian hosts and their Symbiodiniaceae symbionts, resulting
   in the loss of the algal partner. In the Symbiodiniaceae exists a high
   genetic diversity with broad physiological plasticity within and between
   species, resulting in large thermal tolerance. While these variations
   have been studied in individual taxa, comprehensive comparative
   experimental data on numerous species are still rare. In the present
   study, the photosynthetic performance and tolerance as function of light
   and temperature of nine Symbiodiniaceae genetic types of four different
   clades were determined. The data indicate significant differences in the
   response patterns. Almost all algal isolates exhibited low to moderate
   light requirements for photosynthesis without photoinhibition, and a
   photosynthetic efficiency between 20 and 80\% in the temperature range
   20-34 degrees C, indicating a broad thermal tolerance to temperature
   fluctuations in tropical regions. The presented data clearly point to a
   broad photophysiological tolerance and thermal plasticity of genetically
   different Symbiodiniaceae, which contributes as an important finding to
   a better understanding of host-symbiont response to an increasing sea

Number = {12},

Abstract = {An important question in climate modeling is whether carbon cycling is
   fundamentally different in warm versus cold climate states. A key line
   of evidence regarding this question comes from the unusually large
   difference in carbon-isotope values (delta C-13) between
   shallow-dwelling muricate foraminifera and foraminifera living deeper in
   the water column in the Paleogene. This has been interpreted as evidence
   that warmer temperatures elevated the metabolic rates of
   carbon-recycling bacteria, resulting in a steeper gradient in the delta
   C-13 of dissolved inorganic carbon (delta C-13(DIC)) and reduced carbon
   export. However, this interpretation depends on the assumption that
   vital effects-biological processes that bias foraminiferal delta
   C-13-are constant throughout time. We test this assumption using a
   chemical model of the foraminiferal microenvironment and find that the
   hypothesized increase in metabolic rates should also increase vital
   effects, meaning that both Paleogene delta C-13(DIC) gradients and the
   temperature dependence of metabolism must have been significantly lower
   than previously estimated. We further propose that muricate foraminifera
   may have evolved a novel ``mat{''} strategy for photosymbiosis wherein
   symbionts rested on the muricae in a thin layer surrounding the shell.
   This hypothesis can explain both the function of muricae and the
   observed isotopic data without the need for any change in metabolism.
   Our work thus challenges existing interpretations of delta C-13 and
   provides a path forward to empirically test the magnitude of
   temperature-dependent metabolic change in the deep past.},

Abstract = {The impact of elevated CO2 and temperature on photosynthesis and
   calcification in the symbiont-bearing benthic foraminifer Marginopora
   vertebralis was studied. Individual specimens of M. vertebralis were
   collected from Heron Island on the southern Great Barrier Reef
   (Australia). They were maintained for 5 weeks at different temperatures
   (28, 32 A degrees C) and pCO(2) (400, 1,000 A mu atm) levels spanning a
   range of current and future climate-change scenarios. The photosynthetic
   capacity of M. vertebralis was measured with O-2 microsensors and a
   pulse-amplitude-modulated chlorophyll (Chl) fluorometer, in combination
   with estimates of Chl a and Chl c (2) concentrations and calcification
   rates. After 5 weeks, control specimens remained unaltered for all
   parameters. Chlorophyll a concentrations significantly decreased in the
   specimens at 1,000 A mu atm CO2 for both temperatures, while no change
   in Chl c (2) concentration was observed. Photoinhibition was observed
   under elevated CO2 and temperature, with a 70-80 \% decrease in the
   maximum quantum yield of PSII. There was no net O-2 production at
   elevated temperatures in both CO2 treatments as compared to the control
   temperature, supporting that temperature has more impact on
   photosynthesis and O-2 flux than changes in ambient CO2. Photosynthetic
   pigment loss and a decrease in photochemical efficiency are thus likely
   to occur with increased temperature. The elevated CO2 and high
   temperature treatment also lead to a reduction in calcification rate
   (from +0.1 to >-0.1 \% day(-1)). Thus, both calcification and
   photosynthesis of the major sediment-producing foraminifer M.
   vertebralis appears highly vulnerable to elevated temperature and ocean
   acidification scenarios predicted in climate-change models.},

Abstract = {The biology of symbiotic scleractinians is profoundly influenced by
   their intracellular zooxanthellae, and many studies have focused on the
   mechanistic basis of this influence. This has usually been accomplished
   by examining the metabolism of zooxanthellae under physical conditions
   measured in the open reef and assumed to be similar to conditions in
   hospite. Recent advances in the measurement of conditions near and
   within coral tissue suggests that this assumption may result in
   substantial errors. To address this possibility, the role of water flow
   in determining oxygen saturation adjacent to the tissue of Dichocoenia
   stokesii was investigated, and the effect of these measured oxygen
   saturations on the respiration and photosynthesis of zooxanthellae
   isolated from the same species was quantified. Using a microelectrode
   (700 mu m diam), we measured oxygen saturations above (less than or
   equal to 4 mm) the tissue in two flow speeds over 24 h periods in a
   flume receiving sunlight at in situ levels. The results were used as a
   proxy for ecologically relevant intracellular oxygen saturations, which
   were applied to zooxanthellae in vitro to assess their effect on
   symbiont metabolism. Microenvironment oxygen saturations (\% air
   saturation) ranged from 74-159\% in slow how (2.7 cm s(-1)) to 88-110\%
   in faster flow (7.5 cm s(-1)) over day-night cycles. Therefore, the
   metabolic rates of zooxanthellae were measured at 50 to 54\% (hypoxia),
   98 to 102\% (normoxia) and 146 to 150\% (hyperoxia) oxygen saturation.
   Oxygen saturation significantly affected the metabolism of
   zooxanthellae, with gross photosynthesis increasing 1.2-fold and dark
   respiration increasing 2-fold under hyperoxia compared to hypoxia. These
   results suggest that the metabolism of zooxanthellae in hospite is

Abstract = {Preconditioning to non-stressful warming can protect some symbiotic
   cnidarians against the high temperature-induced collapse of their
   mutualistic endosymbiosis with photosynthetic dinoflagellates
   (Symbiodinium spp.), a process known as bleaching. Here, we sought to
   determine whether such preconditioning is underpinned by differential
   regulation of aerobic respiration. We quantified in vivo metabolism and
   mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activity in the naturally symbiotic sea
   anemone Exaiptasia pallida preconditioned to 30 degrees C for > 7 weeks
   as well as anemones kept at 26 degrees C. Preconditioning resulted in
   increased Symbiodinium photosynthetic activity and holobiont (host+
   symbiont) respiration rates. Biomassnormalised activities of host
   respiratory enzymes {[}citrate synthase and the mitochondrial electron
   transport chain (mETC) complexes I and IV] were higher in preconditioned
   animals, suggesting that increased holobiont respiration may have been
   due to host mitochondrial biogenesis and/or enlargement. Subsequent
   acute heating of preconditioned and ` thermally naive' animals to 33
   degrees C induced dramatic increases in host mETC complex I and
   Symbiodinium mETC complex II activities only in thermally naive E.
   pallida. These changes were not reflected in the activities of other
   respiratory enzymes. Furthermore, bleaching in preconditioned E. pallida
   (defined as the significant loss of symbionts) was delayed by several
   days relative to the thermally naive group. These findings suggest that
   changes to mitochondrial biogenesis and/or function in symbiotic
   cnidarians during warm preconditioning might play a protective role
   during periods of exposure to stressful heating.},

Title = {High-temperature acclimation strategies within the thermally tolerant

Abstract = {The dinoflagellate Symbiodinium trenchii associates with a wide array of
   host corals throughout the world, and its thermal tolerance has made it
   of particular interest within the context of reef coral resilience to a
   warming climate. However, future reefs are increasingly likely to face
   combined environmental stressors, further complicating our understanding
   of how S. trenchii will possibly acclimatize to future climate
   scenarios. Over a 33-day period, we characterized the individual and
   combined affects of high temperature (26.5 vs. 31.5 degrees C), pCO(2)
   (400 vs. 760 mu atm), and elevated nutrients (0.4 and 0.2 vs. 3.5 and
   0.3 mu mol of NO3/NO2 and PO43-, respectively) on S. trenchii within the
   host coral species Turbinaria reniformis. Global analysis across all
   treatments found temperature to be the largest driver of physiological
   change. However, exposure to elevated temperature led to changes in
   symbiont physiology that differed across pCO(2) concentrations. Net
   photosynthesis and cellular chlorophyll a increased with temperature
   under ambient pCO(2), whereas temperature-related differences in
   cellular volume and its affect on pigment packaging were more pronounced
   under elevated pCO(2). Furthermore, increased nutrients mitigated the
   physiological response to high temperature under both ambient and
   elevated pCO(2) conditions and represented a significant interaction
   between all three physical parameters. Individual responses to
   temperature and pCO(2) were also observed as cellular density declined
   with elevated temperature and calcification along with respiration rates
   declined with increased pCO(2). Symbiodinium trenchii remained the
   dominant symbiont population within the host across all treatment
   combinations. Our results reveal distinct physiological changes in
   response to high temperature within the S. trenchii/T. reniformis
   symbioses that are dependent on pCO(2) and nutrient concentration, and
   represent important interactive effects to consider as we consider how
   corals will respond under future climate change scenarios.},

Abstract = {Dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium, the endosymbiont of reef
   corals, play an important role in coral-bleaching events which can be
   induced by prolonged enhanced seawater temperature anomalies, and which
   are predicted to occur at increasing frequencies and severities due to
   global warming. The genus Symbiodinium exhibits high genetic diversity
   with physiological variation within and among species, leading to a
   range of thermal tolerance. Although these variations have been examined
   in individual species, comprehensive comparative experimental data
   across several species are still rare. Therefore, in the present study,
   the photophysiological and thermal response patterns of six genetically
   characterized Symbiodinium genotypes were comparatively investigated.
   The six Symbiodinium genotypes were isolated from four different host
   species from the following biogeographic locations: Hawaii (Central
   Pacific), Panama (Caribbean), Florida (Caribbean), and Palau (West
   Pacific). Photosynthesis-irradiance curve and growth measurements at
   temperatures ranging from 20 to 33 A degrees C were carried out. All
   physiological data clearly indicate significant differences in the
   response patterns of the six Symbiodinium genotypes. While some types
   photosynthesized, respired, and grew at 33 A degrees C, others showed a
   partial or complete inhibition. The genotype-specific response over the
   experimental temperature reveals the potential range response of a given
   symbiont and variation between strains that adaptation might act upon.},

Abstract = {The effects of temperature on two reef building corals Pocillopora
   damicornis and P. verrucosa inhabiting the Obhur Creek, a small
   embayment on the western, Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia, was studied
   from December 2009 to November 2010. The overall annual range of
   seawater temperature in Obhur Creek was between 24.5 degrees C and 33
   degrees C . Zooxanthellae abundance and diversity showed seasonal
   variations: the number of zooxanthellae in P. damicornis was slightly
   higher than in P. verrucosa, and the abundance of zooxanthellae of both
   species was low in summer and high during winter. The respiration rate
   of P. verrucosa did not vary between summer and winter, suggesting
   compensatory acclimation. In contrast, the respiratory rate in P.
   damicornis was lower in winter than in summer. During the winter season
   the metabolic rate was higher in both species owing to the optimum
   seawater temperature (30 degrees C). As a result of the abundance of
   zooxanthellae and the optimum seawater temperature, the growth rates of
   the skeletons of the two coral species were higher in winter and lower
   in summer. In general, the results showed that P. verrucosa is more
   flexible with respect to temperature than P. damicornis. The difference
   in zooxanthellae thermal tolerances at 35 degrees C may be due to the
   algal genotypes between the two species, resulting in P. damicornis
   becoming bleached as the rate of metabolism exceeds the rate of
   photosynthesis with increasing temperature.},

Abstract = {Ecology Letters (2012) Abstract Trees with sufficient nutrition are
   known to allocate carbon preferentially to aboveground plant parts. Our
   global study of 49 forests revealed an even more fundamental carbon
   allocation response to nutrient availability: forests with high-nutrient
   availability use 58 +/- 3\% (mean +/- SE; 17 forests) of their
   photosynthates for plant biomass production (BP), while forests with
   low-nutrient availability only convert 42 +/- 2\% (mean +/- SE; 19
   forests) of annual photosynthates to biomass. This nutrient effect
   largely overshadows previously observed differences in carbon allocation
   patterns among climate zones, forest types and age classes. If forests
   with low-nutrient availability use 16 +/- 4\% less of their
   photosynthates for plant growth, what are these used for? Current
   knowledge suggests that lower BP per unit photosynthesis in forests with
   low- versus forests with high-nutrient availability reflects not merely
   an increase in plant respiration, but likely results from reduced carbon
   allocation to unaccounted components of net primary production,
   particularly root symbionts.},

Abstract = {Establishing the thermal reaction norm of coral larvae under elevated
   pCO(2) is crucial to anticipate how larval dispersal and population
   maintenance may be affected by future climate change. Here, we
   characterized the functional relationship between temperature (27-33
   degrees C) and larval performance of the reef coral Pocillopora
   damicornis under two pCO(2) levels. The results showed that the
   temperature threshold of larvae was between 32 and 33 degrees C, as
   evidenced by the abrupt declines in photochemical efficiency and
   symbiont density, whereas no oxidative damage was observed between 27
   and 33 degrees C and elevated pCO(2) did not influence any of these
   parameters. In addition, larval respiration and photosynthesis rates
   exhibited parabolic responses to temperature, and this relationship
   conformed to the Gaussian-Gompertz model with an optimal temperature
   around 31.5 degrees C, which was approximately 2.5 degrees C above the
   summer mean temperature, suggesting the potential for thermal
   acclimation. Most importantly, elevated pCO(2) significantly enhanced
   the larval photosynthesis and the stimulatory effect of elevated pCO(2)
   on the photosynthetic rates and capacity was more pronounced in cool and
   warm temperatures, indicative of shifted thermal sensitivity under high
   pCO(2). These results suggest that ocean acidification could alter the
   thermal performance curves and tolerance window of brooded P. damicornis
   larvae, with profound and important implications for larval ecology in a
   future changing ocean.},

Abstract = {Thermal performance curves describe the relationship between temperature
   and the rate of biological processes. These relationships can vary among
   species and environments, allowing organisms to acclimatize to their
   local thermal regime. This study quantified the seasonal variation in
   the thermal performance of several coral and symbiont-dominated
   physiological traits for the thermally tolerant coral species Porites
   cylindrica and the thermally sensitive coral species Acropora
   valenciennesi. Photosynthesis rates, respiration rates, maximum
   photosystem II (PSII) quantum yield and electron transport rates were
   measured in winter and summer on coral fragments exposed to an acute
   temperature increase and decrease up to 5 degrees C above and below the
   average seawater temperature in each season. Results showed that
   colonies of A. valenciennesi acclimated primarily by shifting their
   optimal temperature to a higher temperature in summer, whereas colonies
   of P. cylindrica had broader thermal breadth during summer. For
   symbionts within both species, performance was higher at all
   temperatures in summer, while the thermal optima and performance breadth
   remained unchanged. Despite these changes in thermal performance, the
   thermal optima of most traits did not match the ambient environmental
   temperature, but fell between the summer and winter temperatures.
   Overall, these results showed that both coral species were
   physiologically plastic in response to temperature change, but that
   there are constraints on the rate or capacity for acclimation that
   prevent a perfect match between the average temperature of the
   environment and the thermal optimum of the species.},

Abstract = {Two inhibitors of the Calvin-Benson cycle {[}glycolaldehyde (GA) and
   potassium cyanide (KCN)] were used in cultured Symbiodinium cells and in
   nubbins of the coral Pocillopora damicornis to test the hypothesis that
   inhibition of the Calvin-Benson cycle triggers coral bleaching.
   Inhibitor concentration range-finding trials aimed to determine the
   appropriate concentration to generate inhibition of the Calvin-Benson
   cycle, but avoid other metabolic impacts to the symbiont and the animal
   host. Both 3 mmol l(-1) GA and 20 mol l(-1) KCN caused minimal
   inhibition of host respiration, but did induce photosynthetic
   impairment, measured by a loss of photosystem II function and oxygen
   production. GA did not affect the severity of bleaching, nor induce
   bleaching in the absence of thermal stress, suggesting inhibition of the
   Calvin-Benson cycle by GA does not initiate bleaching in P. damicornis.
   In contrast, KCN did activate a bleaching response through symbiont
   expulsion, which occurred in the presence and absence of thermal stress.
   While KCN is an inhibitor of the Calvin-Benson cycle, it also promotes
   reactive oxygen species formation, and it is likely that this was the
   principal agent in the coral bleaching process. These findings do not
   support the hypothesis that temperature-induced inhibition of the
   Calvin-Benson cycle alone induces coral bleaching.},

Abstract = {Species have evolved different mechanisms to cope with spatial and
   temporal temperature variability. Species with broad geographical
   distributions may be thermal generalists that perform well across a
   broad range of temperatures, or they might contain subpopulations of
   locally adapted thermal specialists. We quantified the variation in
   thermal performance of two coral species, Porites cylindrica and
   Acropora spp., along a latitudinal gradient over which temperature
   varies by approximately 68 degrees C. Photosynthesis rates, respiration
   rates, maximum quantum yield and maximum electron transport rates were
   measured on coral fragments exposed to an acute temperature increase and
   decrease up to 58 degrees C above and below the local average
   temperature. Results showed geographical variation in the performance
   curves of both species at holobiont and symbiont level, but this did not
   lead to an alignment of the optimal temperature for performance with the
   average temperature of the local environment, suggesting suboptimal
   coral performance of these coral populations in summer. Furthermore,
   symbiont thermal performance generally had an optimum closer to the
   average environmental temperature than holobiont performance, suggesting
   that symbionts have a higher capacity for acclimatization than the coral
   host, and can aid the coral host when temperatures are unfavourable.

   decreased greatly in both intact symbiotic anemones and in FIZ within 20
   minutes after temperature elevation, These results show that oxidative
   stress in A. pulchella is primarily an animal response, and suggest that
   the presence of symbiotic algae, although sufficient to cause hyperoxia,
   is not necessary for the appearance of oxidative stress in these
   anemones at elevated temperature.},

Abstract = {Sponges are major components of benthic communities across the world and
   have been identified as potential ``winners{''} on coral reefs in the
   face of global climate change as result of their tolerance to ocean
   warming and acidification (OA). Previous studies have also hypothesised
   that photosymbiont-containing sponges might have higher productivity
   under future OA conditions as a result of photosymbionts having
   increased access to CO2 and subsequently greater carbon production. Here
   we test this hypothesis for a widespread and abundant
   photosymbiont-containing sponge species Lamellodysidea herbacea at a CO2
   seep in Papua New Guinea simulating OA conditions. We found seep sponges
   had relatively higher cyanobacterial abundance, chlorophyll
   concentrations and symbiont photosynthetic efficiency than non-seep
   sponges, and a three-fold higher sponge abundance at the seep site.
   However, while gross oxygen production was the same for seep and
   non-seep sponges, seep sponge dark respiration rates were higher and
   instantaneous photosynthesis: respiration (P:R) ratios were lower. We
   show that while photosymbiont containing sponges may not have increased
   productivity under OA, they are able to show flexibility in their
   relationships with microbes and offset increased metabolic costs
   associated with climate change associated stress.},

Volume = {12},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Coastal oceans are increasingly eutrophic, warm and acidic through the
   addition of anthropogenic nitrogen and carbon, respectively. Among the
   most sensitive taxa to these changes are scleractinian corals, which
   engineer the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth. Corals' sensitivity is
   a consequence of their evolutionary investment in symbiosis with the
   dinoflagellate alga, Symbiodinium. Together, the coral holobiont has
   dominated oligotrophic tropical marine habitats. However, warming
   destabilizes this association and reduces coral fitness. It has been
   theorized that, when reefs become warm and eutrophic, mutualistic
   Symbiodinium sequester more resources for their own growth, thus
   parasitizing their hosts of nutrition. Here, we tested the hypothesis
   that sub- bleaching temperature and excess nitrogen promotes symbiont
   parasitism by measuring respiration (costs) and the assimilation and
   translocation of both carbon (energy) and nitrogen (growth; both
   benefits) within Orbicella faveolata hosting one of two Symbiodinium
   phylotypes using a dual stable isotope tracer incubation at ambient (26
   degrees C) and sub- bleaching (31 degrees C) temperatures under elevated
   nitrate. Warming to 31 degrees C reduced holobiont net primary
   productivity (NPP) by 60\% due to increased respiration which decreased
   host \% carbon by 15\% with no apparent cost to the symbiont.
   Concurrently, Symbiodinium carbon and nitrogen assimilation increased by
   14 and 32\%, respectively while increasing their mitotic index by 15\%,
   whereas hosts did not gain a proportional increase in translocated
   photosynthates. We conclude that the disparity in benefits and costs to
   both partners is evidence of symbiont parasitism in the coral symbiosis
   and has major implications for the resilience of coral reefs under
   threat of global change.},

Title = {ATP Supply May Contribute to Light-Enhanced Calcification in Corals More
   Than Abiotic Mechanisms},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Zooxanthellate corals are known to increase calcification rates when
   exposed to light, a phenomenon called light-enhanced calcification that
   is believed to be mediated by symbionts' photosynthetic activity. There
   is controversy over the mechanism behind this phenomenon, with
   hypotheses coarsely divided between abiotic and biologically-mediated
   mechanisms. At the same time, accumulating evidence shows that
   calcification in corals relies on active ion transport to deliver the
   skeleton building blocks into the calcifying medium, making it is an
   energetically costly activity. Here we build on generally accepted
   conceptual models of the coral calcification machinery and conceptual
   models of the energetics of coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis to develop a
   model that can be used to isolate the biologically-mediated and abiotic
   effects of photosynthesis, respiration, temperature, and seawater
   chemistry on coral calcification rates and related metabolic costs. We
   tested this model on data from the Mediterranean scleractinian Cladocora
   caespitosa, an acidification resistant species. We concluded that most
   of the variation in calcification rates due to photosynthesis,
   respiration and temperature can be attributed to biologically-mediated
   mechanisms, in particular to the ATP supplied to the active ion
   transports. Abiotic effects are also present but are of smaller
   magnitude. Instead, the decrease in calcification rates caused by
   acidification, albeit small, is sustained by both abiotic and
   biologically-mediated mechanisms. However, there is a substantial extra
   cost of calcification under acidified conditions. Based on these
   findings and on a literature review we suggest that the energy aspect of
   coral calcification might have been so far underappreciated.},

Abstract = {Changes in the seawater carbonate chemistry (ocean acidification) from
   increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations negatively
   affect many marine calcifying organisms, but may benefit primary
   producers under dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) limitation. To improve
   predictions of the ecological effects of ocean acidification, the net
   gains and losses between the processes of photosynthesis and
   calcification need to be studied jointly on physiological and population
   levels. We studied productivity, respiration, and abundances of the
   symbiont-bearing foraminifer species Marginopora vertebralis on natural
   CO2 seeps in Papua New Guinea and conducted additional studies on
   production and calcification on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) using
   artificially enhanced pCO2. Net oxygen production increased up to 90\%
   with increasing pCO2; temperature, light, and pH together explaining
   61\% of the variance in production. Production increased with increasing
   light and increasing pCO2 and declined at higher temperatures.
   Respiration was also significantly elevated (similar to 25\%), whereas
   calcification was reduced (1639\%) at low pH/high pCO2 compared to
   present-day conditions. In the field, M. vertebralis was absent at three
   CO2 seep sites at pHTotal levels below similar to 7.9 (pCO2 similar to
   700 similar to mu atm), but it was found in densities of over 1000
   similar to m-2 at all three control sites. The study showed that
   endosymbiotic algae in foraminifera benefit from increased DIC
   availability and may be naturally carbon limited. The observed reduction
   in calcification may have been caused either by increased energy demands
   for proton pumping (measured as elevated rates of respiration) or by
   stronger competition for DIC from the more productive symbionts. The net
   outcome of these two competing processes is that M. vertebralis cannot
   maintain populations under pCO2 exceeding 700 similar to mu atm, thus
   are likely to be extinct in the next century.},

Abstract = {Studying carbon dynamics in the coral holobiont provides essential
   knowledge of nutritional strategies and is thus central to understanding
   coral ecophysiology. In this study, we assessed the carbon budget in
   Pocillopora damicornis (using (HCO3)-C-13) as a function of feeding
   status and temperature stress. We also compared dissolved oxygen (O-2)
   fluxes measured at the colony scale and at the polyp scale. At both
   scales, O-2 production rates were enhanced for fed vs. unfed corals, and
   unfed corals exhibited higher bleaching and reduced photosynthetic
   activity at high temperature. Unfed corals exclusively respired
   autotrophically acquired carbon, while fed corals mostly respired
   heterotrophically acquired carbon. As a consequence, fed corals excreted
   on average > 5 times more organic carbon than unfed corals.
   Photosynthate translocation was higher under thermal stress, but most of
   the carbon was lost via respiration and/or mucus release (42-46\% and
   57-75\% of the fixed carbon for unfed and fed corals, respectively).
   Such high loss of translocated carbon, coupled to low assimilation rates
   in the coral tissue and symbionts, suggests that P. damicornis was
   nitrogen and/or phosphorus limited. Heterotrophy might thus cover a
   larger portion of the nutritional demand for P. damicornis than
   previously assumed. Our results suggest that active feeding plays a
   fundamental role in metabolic dynamics and bleaching susceptibility of
   corals.},

Abstract = {Atmospheric CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) is expected to increase to 700
   mu atm or more by the end of the present century. Anthropogenic CO2 is
   absorbed by the oceans, leading to decreases in pH and the CaCO3
   saturation state (Omega) of the seawater. Elevated pCO(2) was shown to
   drastically decrease calcification rates in tropical zooxanthellate
   corals. Here we show, using the Mediterranean zooxanthellate coral
   Cladocora caespitosa, that an increase in pCO(2), in the range predicted
   for 2100, does not reduce its calcification rate. Therefore, the
   conventional belief that calcification rates will be affected by ocean
   acidification may not be widespread in temperate corals. Seasonal change
   in temperature is the predominant factor controlling photosynthesis,
   respiration, calcification and symbiont density. An increase in pCO(2),
   alone or in combination with elevated temperature, had no significant
   effect on photosynthesis, photosynthetic efficiency and calcification.
   The lack of sensitivity C. caespitosa to elevated pCO(2) might be due to
   its slow growth rates, which seem to be more dependent on temperature
   than on the saturation state of calcium carbonate in the range projected
   for the end of the century.},

Abstract = {In this paper I challenge the notion that a healthy and resilient coral
   is (in all cases) a fast-growing coral, and by inference, that a reef
   characterised by a fast trajectory toward high coral cover is
   necessarily a healthy and resilient reef. Instead, I explain how
   emerging evidence links fast skeletal extension rates with elevated
   coral-algae (symbiotic) respiration rates, most-often mediated by
   nutrient-enlarged symbiont populations and/or rising sea temperatures.
   Elevated respiration rates can act to reduce the autotrophic capacity
   (photosynthesis:respiration ratio) of the symbiosis. This restricts the
   capacity of the coral host to build and maintain sufficient energy
   reserves (e.g. lipids) needed to sustain essential homeostatic
   functions, including sexual reproduction and biophysical stress
   resistance. Moreover, it explains the somewhat paradoxical scenario,
   whereby at the ecological instant before the reef-building capacity of
   the symbiosis is lost, a reef can look visually at its best and be
   accreting CaCO3 at its maximum.},

Abstract = {Climate change threatens coral survival by causing coral bleaching,
   which occurs when the coral's symbiotic relationship with algal

Abstract = {In this study, we tested whether larvae brooded by the reef coral
   Pocillopora damicornis from a naturally extreme and highly variable
   environment are preadapted to cope with predicted increases in
   temperature and pCO(2). We exposed larvae to two temperatures (29 vs.
   30.8 degrees C) crossed with two pCO(2) levels (similar to 500 vs.
   similar to 1000 mu atm) in a full-factorial experiment for 5 d. Larval
   performance was assessed as dark respiration (R-D), net and gross
   photosynthesis (P-N and P-G, respectively), survival, settlement, and
   the activity of carbonic anhydrase (CA), the central enzyme involved in
   photosynthesis. The results showed that R-D was unaffected by either
   elevated temperature or pCO(2), while elevated temperature and/or pCO(2)
   stimulated P-N and P-G and increased the ratios of P-N to R-D,
   indicating a relatively higher autotrophic capacity. Consequently,
   larval survivorship under elevated temperature and/or pCO(2) was
   consistently 14\% higher than that under the control treatment.
   Furthermore, elevated temperature and pCO(2) did not affect host CA
   activity, but synergistically enhanced symbiont CA activity,
   contributing greatly to the stimulated photosynthetic capacity. These
   results suggest that brooded larvae of P. damicornis larvae from
   Luhuitou may be preadapted to cope with projected warming and ocean
   acidification. More generally, it appears that corals from highly
   variable environments may have increased resilience to the widespread

Abstract = {Coral cell cultures made from reef-building scleractinian corals have
   the potential to aid in the pursuit of understanding of the

Abstract = {Reef-building corals are nutritionally dependent on the symbiotic alga
   Symbiodinium and may therefore select for high-performing symbiont
   lineages. However, the effects of fine-scale genetic variation within
   symbiont populations on host performance are not well understood.
   Applying quantitative PCR (qPCR) to Pocillopora damicornis colonies from
   Lord Howe Island (Australia), we estimated the relative abundance of
   intra-genomically variable (IGV) Symbiodinium cells and those with
   homogeneous rDNA sequence repeats. We then analysed their physical
   status and photosynthetic performance at both ambient and extreme summer
   temperatures (25 and 29 degrees C, respectively) in a closed-system
   oxygen flux chamber. The proportion of IGV Symbiodinium was negatively
   correlated with photosynthetic production and efficiency, and under
   thermal stress, colonies dominated by IGV cells could only meet
   respiratory demands at high irradiance (> 250 mu mol photons m(-2)
   s(-1)). IGV Symbiodinium were also estimated to be 50\% larger by
   volume, occurred at lower density, and had higher chlorophyll c(2)/a
   ratios. The comparatively poor performance of heterogeneous Symbiodinium
   cells suggests either a direct deleterious effect of IGV or reduced
   performance in putative inter-lineage recombinants, whose genomes
   feature ITS2 variants from both parental ribotypes. While it remains
   unclear whether the mixed rDNA arrays result from somatic mutation or
   recombination, our results demonstrate that the beneficial capacity of
   symbionts can vary within Symbiodinium populations, with potential
   implications for host fitness.},

Abstract = {Enhancing the resilience of corals to rising temperatures is now a
   matter of urgency, leading to growing efforts to explore the use of heat
   tolerant symbiont species to improve their thermal resilience. The
   notion that adaptive traits can be retained by transferring the
   symbionts alone, however, challenges the holobiont concept, a
   fundamental paradigm in coral research. Holobiont traits are products of
   a specific community (holobiont) and all its co-evolutionary and local
   adaptations, which might limit the retention or transference of
   holobiont traits by exchanging only one partner. Here we evaluate how
   interchanging partners affect the short- and long-term performance of
   holobionts under heat stress using clonal lineages of the cnidarian
   model system Aiptasia (host and Symbiodiniaceae strains) originating
   from distinct thermal environments. Our results show that holobionts
   from more thermally variable environments have higher plasticity to heat
   stress, but this resilience could not be transferred to other host
   genotypes through the exchange of symbionts. Importantly, our findings
   highlight the role of the host in determining holobiont productivity in
   response to thermal stress and indicate that local adaptations of
   holobionts will likely limit the efficacy of interchanging unfamiliar
   compartments to enhance thermal tolerance.},

Abstract = {The article aimed to assess the net ecosystem metabolism (NEM), and
   photosynthesis performance of Pocillopora acuta coral on the reef flat
   and reef slope of the southeast fringing reef of Phuket, Thailand, from
   June 2017 to January 2018, using 30 x 45-cm benthic oxygen flux chambers
   and a Junior Pulse Amplitude Modulated fluorometer. The results showed
   the NEM at both sites was significantly higher in the dry season. The
   effective quantum yield of P. acuta on the reef slope was significantly
   higher than that of the reef flat in both seasons. The maximum quantum
   yield showed seasonal variation, which was significantly higher on the
   reef slope during the dry season than that in the wet season. This study
   demonstrated temporal and spatial variations in ecosystem metabolism and
   photosynthetic activity due to different physical characteristics, such
   as light intensity, which is the main driver of coral reef ecosystem and
   different biological characteristics, such as the percentage of live
   coral, the number of microalgae and the symbiont density. The results
   provide a better understanding of how P. acuta responds to changes in
   depth and season and why corals on reef slopes might be more susceptible
   to bleaching than corals on reef flats.},

Abstract = {Interpretation of carbon isotope records from late Quaternary planktonic
   foraminifers are confounded due to the presence of a significant
   physiological component in the carbon isotopic signal. A quantitative
   carbon isotope (QC) model is presented which relates the carbon isotopic
   composition of a foraminiferal shell to the physiological processes of
   respiration and symbiont photosynthesis and to the delta C-13 value of
   seawater Sigma CO2. T he QC model is calibrated with physiological and
   stable isotopic data from laboratory experiments with living planktonic
   foraminifers. Model simulations of chamber and shell delta C-13 values
   with the symbiont-bearing foraminifers, Orbulina universa and
   Globigerinoides sacculifer, suggest (1) variations in symbiont density
   and photosynthetic rate (light level or habitat depth) are the primary
   physiological parameters controlling intraspecific carbon isotopic
   variability in these species, (2) respiration has little effect on the
   delta C-13 of O. universa, and (3) each chamber in a multichambered
   foraminiferal test will have a distinct value depending on its position
   in the test whorl. Size:delta C-13 value relationships reported for G.
   sacculifer from fossil assemblages can be explained as a function of

Title = {High light alongside elevated P-CO(2) alleviates thermal depression of
   photosynthesis in a hard coral (Pocillopora acuta)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {223},

Abstract = {The absorbtion of human-emitted CO2 by the oceans (elevated P-CO2) is
   projected to alter the physiological performance of coral reef organisms
   by perturbing seawater chemistry (i.e. ocean acidification).
   Simultaneously, greenhouse gas emissions are driving ocean warming and
   changes in irradiance (through turbidity and cloud cover), which have
   the potential to influence the effects of ocean acidification on coral
   reefs. Here, we explored whether physiological impacts of elevated
   P-CO2, on a coral-algal symbiosis (Pocillopora acuta-Symbiodiniaceae)
   are mediated by light and/or temperature levels. In a 39 day experiment,
   elevated P-CO2 (962 versus 431 patm P-CO2) had an interactive effect
   with midday light availability (400 versus 800 pmol photons m(-2) s(-1))
   and temperature (25 versus 29 degrees C) on areal gross and net
   photosynthesis, for which a decline at 29 degrees C was ameliorated
   under simultaneous high-Pm and high-light conditions. Light-enhanced
   dark respiration increased under elevated P-CO2 and/or elevated
   temperature. Symbiont to host cell ratio and chlorophyll a per symbiont
   increased at elevated temperature, whilst symbiont areal density
   decreased. The ability of moderately strong light in the presence of
   elevated P-CO2 to alleviate the temperature-induced decrease in
   photosynthesis suggests that higher substrate availability facilitates a
   greater ability for photochemical quenching, partially offsetting the
   impacts of high temperature on the photosynthetic apparatus. Future
   environmental changes that result in moderate increases in light levels
   could therefore assist the P. acuta holobiont to cope with the `one-two
   punch' of rising temperatures in the presence of an acidifying ocean.},

Abstract = {The successful dispersal of coral larvae is vital to the population
   replenishment and reef recovery and resilience. De -spite that this
   critical early stage is susceptible to ocean warming and acidification,
   little is known about the responses of coral larvae to warming and
   acidification across different biological scales. This study explored
   the influences of el-evated temperature (29 ? versus 33 ?) and pCO2 (500
   mu atm versus 1000 mu atm) on brooded larvae of Pocillopora damicornis
   at the organismal, cellular and gene expression levels. Heat stress
   caused bleaching, depressed light-enhanced dark respiration,
   photosynthesis and autotrophy, whereas high pCO(2) stimulated
   photosynthesis. Although survival was unaffected, larvae at 33 ? were
   ten-times more likely to settle than those at 29 ?, suggesting reduced
   capacity to disperse and differentiate suitable substrate. Remarkably,
   heat stress induced greater symbiont loss at am -bient pCO(2) than at
   high pCO(2), while cell-specific pigment concentrations of symbionts at
   33 \& DEG;C increased twofold under ambient pCO2 relative to high pCO(2)
   suggesting pCO(2)-dependent bleaching patterns. Considerable increases
   in activities of host antioxidants superoxide dismutase (SOD) and
   catalase (CAT) at 33 ? indicated oxidative stress, whereas lipid
   peroxidation and caspase activities were contained, thereby restraining
   larval mortality at 33 ?. Fur -thermore, the coral host mounted stronger
   transcriptional responses than symbionts. High pCO(2) stimulated host
   met-abolic pathways, possibly because of the boosted algal productivity.
   In contrast, host metabolic processes and symbiont photosystem genes
   were downregulated at 33 ?. Interestingly, the upregulation of
   extracellular matrix genes and glycosaminoglycan degradation pathway at
   33 ? was more evident under ambient pCO(2) than high pCO(2), suggesting
   compromised host tissue integrity that could have facilitated symbiont
   expulsion and bleaching. Our results provide insights into how coral
   larvae respond to warming and acidification at different levels of
   biological organization, and demonstrate that ocean acidification can
   mediate thermal bleaching and gene expression in coral larvae under heat
   stress.},

   Coral Holobiont},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Month = {FEB 13},
Abstract = {The nutritional symbiosis between coral hosts and photosynthetic
   dinoflagellates is fundamental to the functioning of coral reefs. Rising
   seawater temperatures destabilize this relationship, resulting in
   drastic declines in world-wide coral cover. Thermal history is thought
   to play an important role in shaping a coral's response to subsequent
   thermal stress. Here, we exposed Pocillopora damicomis to two thermal
   acclimation regimes (ambient vs. warm) and compared the effect that
   acclimation had on the coral holobiont's response to a subsequent seven
   day heat stress event. We conducted daily physiological measurements at
   the holobiont level (gross photosynthesis, respiration, host protein
   content, symbiont density and chlorophyll content) throughout the
   heating event, as well as cellular-level imaging of C-13-bicarbonate and
   N-15-nitrate assimilation (using NanoSIMS) at the end of the heat stress
   event. Thermal acclimation history had a negligible effect on the
   measurements conducted at the holobiont level during the heat stress
   event. No differences were observed in the O-2-budget between ambient
   and warm-acclimated corals and only small fluctuations in host protein,
   symbiont density and chlorophyll content were detected. In contrast,
   this lack of differential response, was not mirrored at the cellular
   level. Warm-acclimated corals had substantially higher C-13 enrichment
   in the host gastrodermis and lipid bodies, but significantly lower
   N-15-nitrate assimilation in the symbionts and the host tissue layers,
   relative to the ambient-acclimated corals. We discuss potential reasons
   for the disconnect that occurred between symbiont bicarbonate and
   nitrate assimilation (in the absence of photosynthetic breakdown) in the
   warm-acclimated corals. We suggest this represents either a shift in
   nitrogen utilization, or supply limitation by the host. Our findings
   raise several interesting hypotheses regarding the role that nitrogen
   metabolism plays in thermal stress, which will warrant further
   investigation if we are to understand the acclimatization capacity of
   the coral holobiont.},

   carbon use efficiency and carbon sequestration in boreal forests?},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {520},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {There is evidence that carbon fluxes and stocks decrease with increasing
   latitude in boreal forests, suggesting a reduction in carbon use
   efficiency. While vegetation and soil carbon dynamics have been widely
   studied, the empirical finding that ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) become
   more abundant towards the north has not been quantitatively linked to
   carbon use efficiency. We formulated a conceptual model of combined
   fine-root and ECM carbon use efficiency (CUE) as NPP/GPP (net primary
   production/gross primary production). For this, we included the
   mycorrhiza as gains in plant NPP but considered the extramatrical hyphae
   as well as exudates as losses. We quantified the carbon processes across
   a latitudinal gradient using published eco-physiological and
   morphological measurements from boreal coniferous forests. In parallel,
   we developed two CUE models using large-scale empirical measurements
   amended with established models. All models predicted similar
   latitudinal trends in vegetation CUE and net ecosystem production (NEP).
   CUE in the ECM model declined on average by 0.1 from latitude 60 to 70
   with overall mean 0.390 +/- 0.037. NEP declined by 200 g m(-2) yr(-1)
   with mean 171 +/- 79.4 g m(-2) yr(-)(1). ECM had no significant effect
   on predicted soil carbon. Our findings suggest that ECM can use a
   significant proportion of the carbon assimilated by vegetation and hence
   be an important driver of the decline in CUE at higher latitudes. Our
   model suggests the quantitative contribution of ECM to soil carbon to be
   less important but any possible implications through litter quality
   remain to be assessed. The approach provides a simple proxy of ECM
   processes for regional C budget models and estimates.},

Volume = {40},

Pages = {1473-1485},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Coral reefs are on the brink of collapse from global warming and
   associated coral bleaching. Coral bleaching is the loss of algal
   symbionts from the coral tissue. The reduction in photosynthates
   produced by the symbionts makes the survival of the coral dependent on
   heterotrophy and stored resources, which are catabolized into available
   energy, i.e., Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). The present study examined
   how an increase in water temperature affects energetic reserves and
   available ATP in the Red Sea coral Stylophora pistillata. Following a
   9-d hold at 1, 3, 5 degrees C above ambient summer temperature (similar
   to 26 degrees C), ATP levels in the coral tissue remained constant.
   Similarly, no significant differences in the stored energy (proteins,
   carbohydrates, and lipids) of the holobiont were measured. However, half
   of the coral nubbins in the + 7 degrees C treatment experienced tissue
   dissociation, while the remaining nubbins bleached with a 34\% decline
   in stored energy and a decline in respiration and photosynthesis rates
   by 69 and 72\%, respectively. The + 7 degrees C treated coral nubbins
   had 75\% lower carbohydrates compared to nubbins at ambient conditions
   and the lowest carbohydrates to lipid and protein ratio. This study
   demonstrates that exceeding the high bleaching threshold of S.
   pistillata in the Gulf of Aqaba is associated with a catabolic response
   to maintain ATP levels and highlights the energetic cost of thermal
   stress. Understanding anabolic and catabolic processes in corals under
   environmental stress is key to understanding their capacity to survive

Abstract = {Recent research efforts have demonstrated increased bioerosion rates
   under experimentally elevated partial pressures of seawater carbon
   dioxide (pCO(2)) with or without increased temperatures, which may lead
   to net erosion on coral reefs in the future. However, this conclusion
   clearly depends on the ability of the investigated bioeroding organisms
   to survive and grow in the warmer and more acidic future environments,
   which remains unexplored. The excavating sponge Cliona orientalis
   Thiele, is a widely distributed bioeroding organism and symbiotic with
   dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium. Using C. orientalis, an
   energy budget model was developed to calculate amounts of carbon
   directed into metabolic maintenance and growth. This model was tested
   under a range of CO2 emission scenarios (temperature+pCO(2)) appropriate
   to an Austral early summer. Under a pre-industrial scenario, present day
   (control) scenario, or B1 future scenario (associated with reducing the
   rate of CO2 emissions over the next few decades), C. orientalis
   maintained a positive energy budget, where metabolic demand was likely
   satisfied by autotrophic carbon provided by Symbiodinium and
   heterotrophic carbon via filter-feeding, suggesting sustainability.
   Under B1, C. orientalis likely benefited by a greater supply of
   photosynthetic products from its symbionts, which increased by up to
   56\% per unit area, and displayed an improved condition with up to 52\%
   increased surplus carbon available for growth. Under an A1FI future
   scenario (associated with business-as-usual' CO2 emissions) bleached C.
   orientalis experienced the highest metabolic demand, but carbon acquired
   was insufficient to maintain the sponge, as indicated by a negative
   energy budget. These metabolic considerations suggest that previous
   observations of increased bioerosion under A1FI by C. orientalis may not
   last through the height of future A1FI summers, and survival of
   individual sponges may be dependent on the energy reserves (biomass)
   they have accumulated through the rest of the year.},

Abstract = {Continued emissions of CO2, derived from human activities, increase
   atmospheric CO2 concentration. The CO2 rise stimulates plant growth and
   affects yield quality. Effects of elevated CO2 on legume quality depend
   on interactions with N-2-fixing bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi. Growth
   at elevated CO2 increases photosynthesis under short-term exposures in
   C-3 species. Under long-term exposures, however, plants generally
   acclimate to elevated CO2 decreasing their photosynthetic capacity. An
   updated survey of the literature indicates that a key factor, perhaps
   the most important, that characteristically influences this phenomenon,
   its occurrence and extent, is the plant source-sink balance. In legumes,
   the ability of exchanging C for N at nodule level with the N-2-fixing
   symbionts creates an extra C sink that avoids the occurrence of
   photosynthetic acclimation. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonizing
   roots may also result in increased C sink, preventing photosynthetic
   acclimation. Defoliation (Anthyllis vulneraria, simulated grazing) or
   shoot cutting (alfalfa, usual management as forage) largely increases
   root/shoot ratio. During re-growth at elevated CO2, new shoots growth
   and nodule respiration function as strong C sinks that counteracts
   photosynthetic acclimation. In the presence of some limiting factor, the
   legumes response to elevated CO2 is weakened showing photosynthetic
   acclimation. This survey has identified limiting factors that include an
   insufficient N supply from bacterial strains, nutrient-poor soils, low P
   supply, excess temperature affecting photosynthesis and/or nodule
   activity, a genetically determined low nodulation capacity, an inability
   of species or varieties to increase growth (and therefore C sink) at
   elevated CO2 and a plant phenological state or season when plant growth
   is stopped. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   Reef Building Coral},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 11},
Abstract = {As atmospheric levels of CO2 increase, reef-building corals are under
   greater stress from both increased sea surface temperatures and
   declining sea water pH. To date, most studies have focused on either
   coral bleaching due to warming oceans or declining calcification due to
   decreasing oceanic carbonate ion concentrations. Here, through the use
   of physiology measurements and cDNA microarrays, we show that changes in
   pH and ocean chemistry consistent with two scenarios put forward by the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) drive major changes in
   gene expression, respiration, photosynthesis and symbiosis of the coral,
   Acropora millepora, before affects on biomineralisation are apparent at
   the phenotype level. Under high CO2 conditions corals at the phenotype
   level lost over half their Symbiodinium populations, and had a decrease
   in both photosynthesis and respiration. Changes in gene expression were
   consistent with metabolic suppression, an increase in oxidative stress,
   apoptosis and symbiont loss. Other expression patterns demonstrate
   upregulation of membrane transporters, as well as the regulation of
   genes involved in membrane cytoskeletal interactions and cytoskeletal
   remodeling. These widespread changes in gene expression emphasize the
   need to expand future studies of ocean acidification to include a wider
   spectrum of cellular processes, many of which may occur before impacts
   on calcification.},

Abstract = {Stable endosymbiotic relationships between cnidarian animals and
   dinoflagellate algae are vital for sustaining coral reef ecosystems.
   Recent studies have shown that elevated seawater temperatures can cause
   the collapse of their endosymbiosis, known as `bleaching', and result in
   mass mortality. However, the molecular interplay between temperature
   responses and symbiotic states still remains unclear. To identify
   candidate genes relevant to the symbiotic stability, we performed
   transcriptomic analyses under multiple conditions using the symbiotic
   and apo-symbiotic (symbiont free) Exaiptasia diaphana, an emerging model
   sea anemone. Gene expression patterns showed that large parts of
   differentially expressed genes in response to heat stress were specific
   to the symbiotic state, suggesting that the host sea anemone could react
   to environmental changes in a symbiotic state-dependent manner.
   Comparative analysis of expression profiles under multiple conditions
   highlighted candidate genes potentially important in the symbiotic state
   transition under heat-induced bleaching. Many of these genes were
   functionally associated with carbohydrate and protein metabolisms in
   lysosomes. Symbiont algal genes differentially expressed in hospite
   encode proteins related to heat shock response, calcium signaling,
   organellar protein transport, and sugar metabolism. Our data suggest
   that heat stress alters gene expression in both the hosts and symbionts.
   In particular, heat stress may affect the lysosome-mediated degradation
   and transportation of substrates such as carbohydrates through the
   symbiosome (phagosome-derived organelle harboring symbiont) membrane,
   which potentially might attenuate the stability of symbiosis and lead to
   bleaching-associated symbiotic state transition.},

   basic biology, including their activity throughout a 24-h day:night

   Observatory to quantify the rates of diurnal growth, dieback and net
   productivity of extra-radical AM fungi. AM fungal hyphae showed
   significantly different rates of growth and dieback over a period of 24h
   and paralleled the circadian-driven photosynthetic oscillations observed
   in plants. The greatest rates (and incidences) of growth and dieback
   occurred between noon and 18:00h. Growth and dieback events often
   occurred simultaneously and were tightly coupled with soil temperature
   and moisture, suggesting a rapid acclimation of the external phase of AM
   fungi to the immediate environment. Changes in the environmental
   conditions and variability of the mycorrhizosphere may alter the diurnal

Title = {The Response of the Mediterranean Gorgonian Eunicella singularis to
   Thermal Stress Is Independent of Its Nutritional Regime},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 8},
Abstract = {Over the last few decades, sessile benthic organisms from the
   Mediterranean Sea have suffered from the global warming of the world's
   oceans, and several mass mortality events were observed during warm
   summers. It has been hypothesized that mortality could have been due to
   a nutrient (food) shortage following the stratification of the water
   column. However, the symbiotic gorgonian Eunicella singularis has also
   presented a locally exceptional mortality, despite its autotrophic
   capacities through the photosynthesis of its dinoflagellate symbionts.
   Thus, this study has experimentally investigated the response of E.
   singularis to a thermal stress (temperature increase from 18 to 26
   degrees C), with colonies maintained more than 2 months under four
   nutritional diets: autotrophy only (AO), autotrophy and inorganic
   nitrogen addition (AN), autotrophy and heterotrophy (AH), heterotrophy
   only (HO). At 18 degrees C, and contrary to many other anthozoans,
   supplementation of autotrophy with either inorganic nitrogen or food
   (heterotrophy) had no effect on the rates of respiration,
   photosynthesis, as well as in the chlorophyll, lipid and protein
   content. In the dark, heterotrophy maintained the gorgonian's
   metabolism, except a bleaching (loss of pigments), which did not affect
   the rates of photosynthesis. At 24 degrees C, rates of respiration, and
   photosynthesis significantly decreased in all treatments. At 26 degrees
   C, in addition to a decrease in the lipid content of all treatments, a
   bleaching was observed after 1 week in the AO treatment, while the AH
   and AN treatments resisted three weeks before bleaching. These last
   results suggest that, temperatures above 24 degrees C impair the
   energetic reserves of this species and might explain the mortality
   events in the Mediterranean.},

Title = {Coral-macroalgal competition under ocean warming and acidification},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {534},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Competition between corals and macroalgae is frequently observed on
   reefs with the outcome of these interactions affecting the relative
   abundance of reef organisms and therefore reef health. Anthropogenic
   activities have resulted in increased atmospheric CO2 levels and a
   subsequent rise in ocean temperatures. In addition to increasing water
   temperature, elevated CO2 levels are leading to a decrease in oceanic pH
   (ocean acidification). These two changes have the potential to alter
   ecological processes within the oceans, including the outcome of
   competitive coral-macroalgal interactions. In our study, we explored the
   combined effect of temperature increase and ocean acidification on the
   competition between the coral Porites lobata and on the Great Barrier
   Reef abundant macroalga Chlorodesmis fastigiata. A temperature increase
   of +1 degrees C above present temperatures and CO2 increase of +85 ppm
   were used to simulate a low end emission scenario for the mid- to late
   21st century, according to the Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6
   (RCP2.6). Our results revealed that the net photosynthesis of P. lobata
   decreased when it was in contact with C. fastigiata under ambient
   conditions, and that dark respiration increased under RCP2.6 conditions.
   The Photosynthesis to Respiration (P:R) ratios of corals as they
   interacted with macroalgal competitors were not significantly different
   between scenarios. Dark calcification rates of corals under RCP2.6
   conditions, however, were negative and significantly decreased compared
   to ambient conditions. Light calcification rates were negatively
   affected by the interaction of macroalgal contact in the RCP2.6
   scenario, compared to algal mimics and to coral under ambient
   conditions. Chlorophyll a, and protein content increased in the RCP2.6
   scenario, but were not influenced by contact with the macroalga. We
   conclude that the coral host was negatively affected by RCP2.6
   conditions, whereas the productivity of its symbionts (zooxanthellae)
   was enhanced. While a negative effect of the macroalga (C. fastigiata)
   on the coral (P. lobata) was observed for the P:R ratio under control
   conditions, it was not enhanced under RCP2.6 conditions.},

Abstract = {Stable oxygen and carbon isotope measurements on biogenic calcite and
   aragonite have become standard tools for reconstructing past
   oceanographic and climatic change. In aquatic organisms, O-18/O-16
   ratios in the shell carbonate are a function of the ratio in the sea
   water and the calcification temperature(1). In contrast, C-13/C-12
   ratios are controlled by the ratio of dissolved inorganic carbon in sea
   water and physiological processes such as respiration and symbiont
   photosynthesis', These geochemical proxies have been used with analyses
   of foraminifera shells to reconstruct global ice volumes(3), surface and
   deep ocean temperatures(4,5), ocean circulation changes(6) and
   glacial-interglacial exchange between the terrestrial and oceanic carbon
   pools(7). Here, we report experimental measurements on living symbiotic
   and non-symbiotic plankton foraminifera (Orbulina universa and
   Globigerina bulloides respectively) showing that the C-13/C-12 and
   O-18/O-16 ratios of the calcite shells decrease with increasing seawater

   than today(8), these new relationships confound the standard
   interpretation of glacial foraminiferal stable-isotope data In
   particular, the hypothesis that the glacial-interglacial shift in the
   C-13/C-12 ratio was due to a transfer of terrestrial carbon into the
   ocean(7) can be explained alternatively by an increase in ocean
   alkalinity(25). A carbonate-concentration effect could also help explain

Title = {A field-based study on variation in Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca in larger benthic
   foraminifera},
Journal = {GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 19},
Abstract = {{[}1] The Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios of foraminifera are used as proxies of
   paleotemperature. Although the Mg/Ca is found to be related with
   temperature in planktonic foraminifera, the reliability of this proxy in
   benthic foraminifera has yet to be established. It is essential
   therefore to understand the minor elements' composition and their
   relation to ambient water parameters in different benthic foraminiferal
   species. In this study, a systematic field-based study was carried out
   on larger benthic foraminifera (LBF) of Okinawa ( Japan) to assess if
   Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca in their tests could be used as proxies of seawater
   temperature. Five seasonal samples were collected from the reef flat to
   pick live specimens of Amphistegina lessonii, Neorotalia calcar,
   Calcarina hispida, Calcarina gaudichaudii, Baculogypsina sphaerulata,
   and Marginopora kudakajimaensis. The Mg/Ca in A. lessonii was -60
   mmol/mol, while in the remaining five species the values were >200
   mmol/mol, substantially higher than that recorded in planktonic and
   smaller benthic foraminifera. Interspecies and intraspecies Mg/Ca
   variations were fairly large even in samples of the same season. The
   Sr/Ca were quite uniform ( -2 mmol/mol) across the species and seasons.
   The correlations between test Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca and ambient water
   temperature and salinity were found to be poor. The possible reasons are
   ( 1) the influence of biological activities, particularly the
   photosynthesis-respiration cycle of algal symbionts, and ( 2) masking of
   the true relationship due to an ``averaging'' effect in whole-test
   analysis of species having longer a life span. In view of this it is
   suggested that the whole-shell Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca of LBF is not an apt
   proxy of paleotemperature.},

Abstract = {Foliicolous lichens complete their life cycles upon non-deciduous leaves
   in humid tropical and subtropical environments. The anatomy of these
   lichens and its adaptations to this specialized niche have received only
   limited attention. The present work examines the structural organization
   in seven species of the Gomphillaceae that colonize palm leaves in
   south-west Florida, USA. Thalli with their leaf substratum were embedded
   in resin and examined with SEM in backscattered electron detection mode.
   All species showed a continuous, covering epilayer of fungal origin that
   consisted of relatively sparse, scattered cell lumina of reduced
   diameter connected by cell wall-derived material. Fungal cells were
   intermixed below this layer, with algal cells often resting directly on
   the substratum. Interactions between symbionts were mainly limited to
   wall-to-wall contacts without penetration. The epilayer showed
   continuity with the fungal prothallus at the perimeter of the thalli.
   Crystalline deposits in the upper portions of thalli were common,
   particularly in the species of Gyalectidium examined. All thalli were
   entirely epicuticular; some covered the stomata of the leaf beneath. It
   is suggested that the prominence of non-living wall materials and
   mineral crystals in thallus structure might serve to minimize the
   metabolic cost of fungal tissue in climates where warm temperatures at
   night result in higher rates of respiration.},

Abstract = {Paleoecological interpretations based on stable isotope study of benthic
   (Uvigerina semiornata) and planktonic (Globigerina bulloides,
   Globigerinoides trilobus) foraminiferal shells from the Paratethys
   Vienna Basin (southwestern Slovakia) are presented. The study was
   performed on sediments of the Devinska Nova Ves-clay pit deposited
   during the Middle and bate Badenian (Middle Miocene). Our delta C-13
   data show an enhanced nutrient input to the water column and the organic
   matter accumulation at the bottom of the Vienna Basin. The
   remineralization of accumulated organic matter on the sea floor resulted
   in the formation of oxygen-depleted zones, where no oxic indicators but
   the oxygen-deficiency tolerant species were found. Positive benthic
   delta O-18 signal can be attributed to the influence of the global
   cooling recognized in the world-ocean during the Middle Miocene. At the
   same time, variations observed in the water column are interpreted as
   reflecting the local temperature and salinity changes resulting from the
   fluvial and rain inflow. The differences between surface and bottom
   water temperature reflect the stratification of the water column. Such
   stratification might be related to the isolation process of Central
   Paratethys in the Badenian. This shady confirms that delta C-13 and
   delta O-18 are not always in isotopic equilibrium with the ambient water
   but are also influenced by vital effects (respiration, symbiont
   photosynthesis...). The vital effects led to the incorporation of
   isotopically light metabolic CO2 into Globigerina bulloides resulting in
   high similarity between delta C-13 values of Uvigerina and Globigerina.
   It has been shown that the extremely high delta C-13 and very low delta
   O-18 of Globigerinoides trilobus clearly imply the influence of algal
   photosymbionts.},

Title = {Light is an active contributor to the vital effects of coral skeleton
   proxies},

Abstract = {Symbiotic colonies of the coral Acropora sp. were cultured in a
   factorial design of three temperatures (21, 25 and 28 degrees C) and two
   light intensities (200 and 400 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1)), under
   constant conditions. A temperature of 25 degrees C and a light intensity
   of 200 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1) was the starting culture condition.
   Metabolic (photosynthesis, respiration, calcification and surface
   expansion rate) and geochemical measurements (delta O-18, delta C-13,
   Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca) were conducted on 6 colonies for each experimental
   condition. Metabolic measurements confirmed that respiration,
   photosynthesis, calcification and surface expansion rate responded to
   the combined effect of temperature and light. Under each light
   intensity, mean calcification rate was linearly correlated with mean
   photosynthetic activity. Geochemical measurements were also influenced
   by temperature and, to a lesser degree, by light. All geochemical
   proxies measured on 6 nubbins showed a wide scattering of values,
   regardless of the environmental condition. Compared to the other
   proxies, delta O-18 exhibited a different behavior. It was the only
   proxy exhibiting temperature tracer behavior. However, while mean values
   of Sr/Ca, Mg/Ca and delta C-13 were well correlated, the correlation
   between the later and mean delta O-18 differed with light level. This
   suggests that both skeleton deposition and temperature oxygen
   fractionation differs according to light intensity. Overall, the effect
   of light on geochemical values seems to compromise the use of proxy
   calibrations solely based on temperature influence.
   Under high light conditions, the great amplitude shown by individual net
   photosynthesis is directly proportional to the highly variable
   zooxanthellae density. As light is affecting all of the proxies, we thus
   assume that the strong geochemical variability observed could be
   explained by various algae densities, each nubbin responding according
   to its zooxanthellae amount. Accordingly, we suggest that each
   symbiosome (the assemblage of few corallites with their symbionts)
   presents its own vital effect influence over time. Therefore, at a bulk
   sample scale, light could be considered as one of the major causes of
   what is commonly referred to as the `vital effect'. The meaning of delta
   O-18 calibration versus temperature established from distinct colonies
   differs from calibration calculated from samples collected following the
   growth axis of a single coral head.
   Finally, in order to quantitatively reconstruct climatic condition, we
   suggest a new paradigm based on the statistical treatment of the
   combination of time-series information from several proxies, all
   measured on the same sample from a continuous symbiosome. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Corals are relatively stenothermic organisms and highly sensitive to
   thermal stress. To understand how heating rate modulates the holobiont
   response to thermal challenge, we compared the effects of acute heat
   shock and cumulative thermal exposures on Acropora cervicornis from
   Southeast Florida (26 degrees 06 N, 80 degrees 05 W). In March of 2017,
   maximum dark-adapted yield of photosystem II (F-V/F-M), rates of dark
   respiration (R), and rates of gross photosynthesis (P-g) were measured
   at temperatures spanning 25-36 degrees C. Thermal performance curves of
   each response variable were constructed as a function of temperature and
   thermal dose (i.e., degree heating minutes). Acute exposure (i.e.,
   instantaneously increasing temperature by between 2.5 and 10 degrees C)
   resulted in a more marked decline in physiology despite a lower thermal
   dose, compared to the cumulative exposure (2.5 degrees C h(-1)).
   Apparent deficits in coral holobiont metabolism were observed as a
   function of both temperature and thermal dose, but examination of
   holobiont metabolism in a dose-context revealed more pronounced
   differences between acute and cumulative exposures. Subtle physiological
   differences may be more easily identified and better cross-study
   comparisons of cnidarian thermal tolerance may be achieved by placing
   temperature exposures in degree heating times. In addition, the ratio of
   daily P-g:R fell below 1 when temperatures exceeded 32 degrees C,
   corroborating prior observations that P-g:R may be a means of
   identifying physiological deficits in advance of visual signs of
   dysbiosis, such as bleaching.},

Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {128},
Pages = {135-146},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {In order for sessile organisms to survive environmental fluctuations and
   exposures to pollutants, molecular mechanisms (i.e. stress responses)
   are elicited. Previously, detrimental effects of natural and
   anthropogenic stressors on coral health could not be ascertained until
   significant physiological responses resulted in visible signs of stress
   (e.g. tissue necrosis, bleaching). In this study, a focused. anthozoan
   holobiont microarray was used to detect early and sub-lethal effects of
   spatial and temporal environmental changes on gene expression patterns
   in the scleractinian coral, Montastraea cavernosa, on south Florida
   reefs. Although all colonies appeared healthy (i.e. no visible tissue
   necrosis or bleaching), corals were differentially physiologically
   compensating for exposure to stressors that varied over time. Corals
   near the Port of Miami inlet experienced significant changes in
   expression of stress responsive and symbiont (zooxanthella)-specific
   genes after periods of heavy precipitation. In contrast, coral
   populations did not demonstrate stress responses during periods of
   increased water temperature (up to 29 degrees C). Specific acute and
   long-term localized responses to other stressors were also evident. A
   correlation between stress response genes and symbiont-specific genes
   was also observed, possibly indicating early processes involved in the
   maintenance or disruption of the coral zooxanthella symbiosis. This is
   the first study to reveal spatially- and temporally-related variation in
   gene expression in response to different stressors of in situ coral
   populations, and demonstrates that microarray technology can be used to
   detect specific sub-lethal physiological responses to specific
   environmental conditions that are not visually detectable. (c) 2012

Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {173-182},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The effects of multiple stressors on the early life stages of
   reef-building corals are poorly understood. Elevated temperature is the
   main physiological driver of mass coral bleaching events, but increasing
   evidence suggests that other stressors, including elevated dissolved
   inorganic nitrogen (DIN), may exacerbate the negative effects of thermal
   stress. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the performance of
   larvae of Orbicella faveolata and Porites astreoides, two important
   Caribbean reef coral species with contrasting reproductive and algal
   transmission modes, under increased temperature and/or elevated DIN. We
   used a fluorescence-based microplate respirometer to measure the oxygen
   consumption of coral larvae from both species, and also assessed the
   effects of these stressors on P. astreoides larval settlement and
   mortality. Overall, we found that (1) larvae increased their respiration
   in response to different factors (O. faveolata in response to elevated
   temperature and P. astreoides in response to elevated nitrate) and (2)
   P. astreoides larvae showed a significant increase in settlement as a
   result of elevated nitrate, but higher mortality under elevated
   temperature. This study shows how microplate respirometry can be
   successfully used to assess changes in respiration of coral larvae, and
   our findings suggest that the effects of thermal stress and nitrate
   enrichment in coral larvae may be species specific and are neither
   additive nor synergistic for O. faveolata or P. astreoides. These
   findings may have important consequences for the recruitment and
   community reassembly of corals to nutrient-polluted reefs that have been
   impacted by climate change.},

Abstract = {In situ and laboratory experiments conducted over the past quarter of a
   century have greatly increased our understanding of the ecology of
   deep-sea hydrothermal systems. Early experiments suggested that
   chemosynthetic primary production constituted the principal source of
   organic matter for biological communities associated with vents,
   although subsequent studies have revealed many complexities associated
   with interactions between microbes and higher organisms inhabiting these
   ecosystems. A diversity of host-microbial symbiont relationships has
   been identified and experimental studies have revealed the exquisite
   physiological adaptations within the giant tubeworm, Riftia pachyptila,
   for the uptake, fixation, and assimilation of carbon. In vitro
   experiments demonstrated the unusual sulfide binding properties of
   tubeworm hemoglobin that prevent inhibition of the cytochrome-c oxidase
   enzyme system during transport of sulfide to symbiont-bearing tissues.
   Studies of respiration and growth of several species of vent organisms
   conducted over the past two decades transformed earlier views that low
   metabolism and slow growth are characteristics of all organisms
   inhabiting all deep-sea environments. Results of recent experiments
   suggest that metabolic rates correlate with the degree of mobility of
   the organisms rather than with any specific attribute of the deep-sea
   environment itself, and growth rates of certain vent organisms (e.g., R.
   pachyptila) were found to be among the highest in any marine
   environments. While extreme thermal tolerance has been suggested as
   characteristic of certain vent fauna (e.g., alvinellid polychaetes and
   alvinocarid shrimp), the majority of vent metazoans live at temperatures
   below 20 degreesC and additional experiments are necessary to reconcile
   field experiments documenting thermal tolerance in situ, thermal
   tolerance in vivo, and thermal sensitivity of biochemical constituents
   of vent organisms. Transplantation and clearance experiments, as well as
   in situ characterization of vent fluid chemistry, have greatly increased
   our understanding of organism-environment interactions. Early analyses
   of metazoan egg size and larval morphology, coupled with in vivo larval
   culture experiments, available physical oceanographic data, and genetic
   studies of gene flow, have contributed greatly to our understanding of
   mechanisms of dispersal between widely separated vent sites. The
   documentation of invertebrate colonization and succession of new vents
   following a volcanic eruption, and a series of manipulative field
   experiments, provide considerable insights into the relative roles of
   abiotic conditions and biotic interactions in structuring vent
   communities. Recent and emerging technological developments, such as in
   situ chemical analyzers, observatory approaches, and laboratory-based
   pressure culture systems, should provide invaluable new experimental
   tools for tackling many remaining questions concerning the ecology of
   deep-sea hydrothermal systems. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Temperate organisms are generally exposed to a more variable and cooler
   climate than tropical organisms, and are therefore expected to have
   broader thermal tolerance and a different thermal performance curve.
   This study investigated these hypotheses by comparing the thermal
   performance of two common tropical coral species found in the Great
   Barrier Reef with the two most common temperate coral species from the
   Mediterranean Sea. Photosynthesis rates, dark respiration rates, maximum
   PSII quantum yield (F-v/F-m) and electron transport rates (rETR(m)) were
   measured on coral fragments exposed to an acute temperature increase and
   decrease up to 5 degrees C above and below the average environmental
   seawater temperature. Dark respiration rates and F-v/F-m increased
   linearly with temperature, suggesting broad thermal tolerance. For
   photosynthesis and rETR(m), the performance breadths were surprisingly
   similar between the tropical and temperate species. However, the thermal
   optimum for performance was generally below the local average
   temperature, and only coincided with the prevailing environmental
   temperature for one of the tropical species. The broad thermal tolerance
   for photosynthesis displayed in this study supports previous
   observations that corals can survive short periods of abnormally warm
   temperatures and suggests that corals adopt thermal generalist
   strategies to cope with temperature variation in the environment.
   Nevertheless, current mean temperatures are 10-30\% above the thermal
   optimum for the species studied here, demonstrating that conditions are
   already pushing the boundaries of coral thermal tolerance.},

Abstract = {Hermatypic-zooxanthellate corals track the diel patterns of the main
   environmental parameters temperature, UV and visible light - by
   acclimation processes that include biochemical responses. The diel
   course of solar radiation is followed by photosynthesis rates and
   thereby elicits simultaneous changes in tissue oxygen tension due to the
   shift in photosynthesis/respiration balance. The recurrent patterns of
   sunlight are reflected in fluorescence yields, photosynthetic pigment
   content and activity of the two protective enzymes superoxide dismutase
   (SOD) and catalase (CAT), enzymes that are among the universal defenses
   against free radical damage in living tissue. All of these were
   investigated in three scleractinian corals: Favia favus, Plerogyra
   sinuosa and Goniopora lobata. The activity of SOD and CAT in the animal
   host followed the course of solar radiation, increased with the rates of
   photosynthetic oxygen production and was correlated with a decrease in
   the maximum quantum yield of photochemistry in Photosystem H (PSII)
   (Delta F'/F-m'). SOD and CAT activity in the symbiotic algae also
   exhibited a light intensity correlated pattern, albeit a less pronounced
   one. The observed rise of the free-radical-scavenger enzymes, with a
   time scale of minutes to several hours, is an important protective
   mechanism for the existence and remarkable success of the unique
   cnidarian-dinoflagellate associations, in which photosynthetic oxygen
   production takes place within animal cells. This represents a facet of
   the precarious act of balancing the photosynthetic production of oxygen
   by the algal symbionts with their destructive action on all living
   cells, especially those of the animal host.},

Journal = {MARINE CHEMISTRY},

Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {Scleratinian corals (hard corals) and their symbiotic algae are the
   ecological engineers of biodiverse and geological important coral reef
   habitats. The complex, linked physiological processes that enable the
   holobiont (coral + algae) to calcify and generate reef structures are
   consequently of great interest. However, the mechanism of calcification
   is difficult to study for several reasons including the small spatial
   scales of the processes and the close coupling between the symbiont and
   host. In this study, we explore the utility of pH and Ca2+
   microelectrodes for constraining the rates and spatial distribution of
   photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification. The work focuses on
   vertical profiles of pH and Ca2+ through the coelenteron cavity, a
   semi-isolated compartment of modified seawater amenable to quantitative
   interpretation. In two studied species, Turbincuia reniformis and
   Acropora nallepora, Ca2+ concentrations decreased in a roughly linear
   manner from the mouth to the base of the coelenteron, indicating the
   primary physiological process affecting Ca2+ concentration is removal
   for calcification below the coelenteron. In contrast, the H+
   concentration remained relatively constant over much of the coelenteron
   cavity before it increased sharply toward the base of the coelenteron,
   indicative of proton-pumping from the calcification fluid below. The
   estimated H+ gradient between the coelenteron cavity and the
   calcification site was > 10 times higher than previously predicted.
   Consequently, the energy required to export protons from the calcifying
   fluid was estimated to be similar to 3 times higher than previously
   calculated. A one-dimensional reaction-diffusion model was used to
   interpret the pH profile considering the effects of photosynthesis,
   respiration, and calcification. This model provided a good fit to the
   observed pH profile and helped to constrain the rates and spatial
   distribution of these processes. Our modeling results also suggested
   that adult corals with deeper polyps may be more sensitive to ocean
   acidification (OA) because of enhanced difficulty to transport H+ out of
   the coelenteron and into the surrounding seawater.},

Abstract = {The direct influence of anthropogenic CO2 might play a limited role in
   pH regulation in coastal ecosystems as pH regulation in these areas can
   be complex. They experience large variability across a broad range of
   spatial and temporal scales, with complex external and internal drivers.
   Organisms influence pH at a patch scale, where community metabolic
   effects and hydrodynamic processes interact to produce broad ranges in
   pH, (similar to 0.3-0.5 pH units) over daily cycles and spatial scales
   (mm to m) particularly in shallow vegetated habitats and coral reefs
   where both respiration and photosynthetic activity are intense.
   Biological interactions at the ecosystem scale, linked to patchiness in
   habitat landscapes and seasonal changes in metabolic processes and
   temperature lead to changes of about 0.3-0.5 pH units throughout a year.
   Furthermore, on the scale of individual organisms, small-scale processes
   including changes at the Diffusive Boundary Layer (DBL), interactions
   with symbionts, and changes to the specific calcification environment,
   induce additional changes in excess of 0.5 pH units.
   In these highly variable pH environments calcifying organisms have
   developed the capacity to alter the pH of their calcifying environment,
   or specifically within critical tissues where calcification occurs, thus
   achieving a homeostasis. This capacity to control the conditions for
   calcification at the organism scale may therefore buffer the full
   impacts of ocean acidification on an organism scale, although this might
   be at a cost to the individual. Furthermore, in some areas, calcifiers
   may potentially benefit from changes to ambient seawater pH, where
   photosynthetic organisms drawdown CO2. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   universa d'Orbigny is larger at lower temperatures, a condition that
   prevails during upwelling events. For logistical reasons, the mean final
   size of Globigerinoides sacculifer (Brady) does not show a consistent
   tendency with feeding rate. Globigerinoides ruber (d'Orbigny) does not
   tolerate high levels of brine shrimp and was thus not cultured at higher
   feeding levels.
   Globigerinella siphonifera and O. universa reach smaller shell sizes
   under light conditions that characterize fertile regions (yellow-green)
   relative to typical open ocean light conditions (blue). In contrast, G.
   ruber attains smaller shell sizes under blue light relative to
   yellow-green light. Again, G. sacculifer does not show a clear trend
   with respect to final test size under normal and upwelling light.
   The effect of longer wavelength light counteracts and overrules the
   effect of increased prey capture rates in the investigated symbiont
   bearing species. This phenomenon is explained by photosynthesis-limited
   host respiration. The extent to which the light effect counteracts the
   effect of feeding, probably depends on the habitat to which the species
   are originally adapted. Quantitative and qualitative pigment analyses
   suggest that G. ruber lives in a shallow, G. sacculifer lives in a
   deeper, and G. siphonifera in the deepest habitat. Data from the
   literature indicate that O. universa lives at intermediate depth between
   G. siphonifera and G. sacculifer. As G. siphonifera is somehow adapted
   to low intensity longer wavelength light, the negative effect of low
   intensity and longer wavelength light is minimized in this species. As a
   result, the effect of increased feeding rate is most pronounced in this
   species.
   Fertile water is found in upwelling settings and in areas where rivers
   enter into the ocean. Comparison of sediments from fertile regions and
   neighboring open ocean sites shows that symbiont bearing planktonic
   foraminifers attain smaller shell sizes in the upwelling area off
   Benguela but that larger shells are found in the Zaire river plume. Due
   to the small quantity of reference sediment, statistically significant
   differences were found only for O. universa. The different response is
   explained as the result of limited respiration in upwelling areas
   because of lower than usual oxygen levels.
   The morphology of the final chamber is influenced by both light quality
   and feeding rate. At higher feeding rates the number of sac-like
   phenotypes is decreased. Yellow-green light induces more kummerform
   morphologies in G. sacculifer, G. ruber, and G. siphonifera and
   increases second sphere formation in O. universa. Light quality effects
   the terminal morphology to a larger extent than prey capture rates do.
   Unfortunately, these trends could not be confirmed in our reference
   sediment due to the low number of kummerforms and sac-like chambers.
   Water fertility also influences the fractionation of stable oxygen
   isotopes. It is concluded that G. sacculifer does not secrete carbonate
   in equilibrium with ambient seawater. Isotopically lighter tests are
   constructed un. der longer wavelength light conditions and they tend to
   get heavier with increasing prey capture rates. Specimens with sac-like
   chambers are lighter than normalform specimens whereas kummerform types
   are heavier than normalform types.},

Abstract = {Scleractinian coral populations are declining worldwide in response to a
   variety of factors including increases in sea surface temperatures. To
   evaluate the effects of predicted elevated seawater temperatures on
   coral recruitment, larvae from the coral Porites astreoides were exposed
   to seawater at ambient (27.3 A degrees C) or elevated temperature (30.8
   A degrees C) conditions for 4, 24, or 48 h. Following exposure, larvae
   were tested for survival and settlement, oxidative stress, respiratory
   demand, and mRNA expression of heat-shock proteins (Hsps) 16 and 60.
   While elevated temperature had no effect on larval survival, settlement,
   or expression of Hsps, it did cause a significant increase in larval
   respiration, oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation), and antioxidant
   enzyme activity (catalase). The absence of a significant up-regulation
   of Hsp 16 or 60 expression in response to thermal stress suggests that
   the transcriptional expression of these genes is a less sensitive
   diagnostic tool compared to biomarkers of oxidative stress at the
   temperatures examined. The results of this study provide evidence that
   enhanced levels of oxidative stress are encountered in
   zooxanthellae-containing coral larvae in response to elevated
   temperatures and that this occurrence should be strongly considered for
   use as a biomarker when monitoring sub-lethal cellular responses to
   rising sea surface temperatures.},

Abstract = {Leaf-cutter ants are a prominent feature in Neotropical ecosystems, but
   a comprehensive assessment of their effects on ecosystem functions is
   lacking. We reviewed the literature and used our own recent findings to
   identify knowledge gaps and develop a framework to quantify the effects
   of leaf-cutter ants on ecosystem processes. Leaf-cutter ants disturb the
   soil structure during nest excavation changing soil aeration and
   temperature. They mix relatively nutrient-poor soil from deeper layers
   with the upper organic-rich layers increasing the heterogeneity of
   carbon and nutrients within nest soils. Leaf-cutter ants account for
   about 25\% of all herbivory in Neotropical forest ecosystems, moving
   10\%-15\% of leaves in their foraging range to their nests. Fungal
   symbionts transform the fresh, nutrient-rich vegetative material to
   produce hyphal nodules to feed the ants. Organic material from roots and
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi enhances carbon and nutrient turnover in
   nest soils and creates biogeochemical hot spots. Breakdown of organic
   matter, microbial and ant respiration, and nest waste material
   decomposition result in increased CO2, CH4, and N2O production, but the
   build-up of gases and heat within the nest is mitigated by the tunnel
   network ventilation system. Nest ventilation dynamics are challenging to
   measure without bias, and improved sensor systems would likely solve
   this problem. Canopy gaps above leaf-cutter ant nests change the light,
   wind and temperature regimes, which affects ecosystem processes. Nests
   differ in density and size depending on colony age, forest type and
   disturbance level and change over time resulting in spatial and temporal
   changes of ecosystem processes. These characteristics remain a challenge
   to evaluate rapidly and non-destructively. Addressing the knowledge gaps
   identified in this synthesis will bring insights into physical and
   biological processes driving biogeochemical cycles at the nest and
   ecosystem scale and will improve our understanding of ecosystem
   biogeochemical heterogeneity and larger scale ecological phenomena. A
   plain language summary is available for this article.},

Title = {The fluted giant clam (Tridacna squamosa) increases the protein
   abundance of the host's copper-zinc superoxide dismutase in the colorful

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The colorful outer mantle of giant clams contains abundance of symbiotic
   dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae) and iridocytes, and has direct exposure
   to light. In light, photosynthesizing dinoflagellates produce O-2, and
   the host cells in the outer mantle would be confronted with
   hyperoxia-related oxidative stress. In comparison, the whitish inner
   mantle contains few symbiotic dinoflagellates and no iridocytes. It is
   involved in shell formation, and is shaded from light. CuZnSOD is a
   cytosolic enzyme that scavenges intracellular O-2(center dot-). We had
   obtained from the outer mantle of the fluted giant clam, Tridacna
   squamosa, the complete cDNA coding sequence of a host-derived copper
   zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), which comprised 462 bp and encoded
   for 154 amino acids with a calculated MW of 15.6 kDa. CuZnSOD was
   expressed strongly in the outer mantle, ctenidium, hepatopancreas and
   kidney. The transcript level of CuZnSOD remained unchanged in the outer
   mantle during light exposure, but the protein abundance of CuZnSOD
   increased -3-fold after exposure to light for 6 or 12 h. By contrast, 12
   h of light exposure had no significant effects on the gene and protein
   expression levels of CuZnSOD/CuZnSOD in the inner mantle. Hence, the
   increased expression of CuZnSOD in the outer mantle of T. squamosa was
   probably a host's response to ameliorate oxidative stress related to
   photosynthesis in the symbionts, and not simply due to increased
   metabolic rate in the host cells. Evidently, the host clam must possess
   light- or O-2-responsive antioxidative defenses in order to align with
   the light-dependent photosynthetic activity of its symbionts.},

Abstract = {Warming and changes in ocean carbonate chemistry alter marine coastal
   ecosystems at an accelerating pace. The interaction between these
   stressors has been the subject of recent studies on reef organisms such
   as corals, bryozoa, molluscs, and crustose coralline algae. Here we
   investigated the combined effects of elevated sea surface temperatures
   and pCO(2) on two species of photosymbiont-bearing coral reef
   Foraminifera: Heterostegina depressa (hosting diatoms) and Marginopora
   vertebralis (hosting dinoflagellates). The effects of single and
   combined stressors were studied by monitoring survivorship, growth, and
   physiological parameters, such as respiration, photochemistry (pulse
   amplitude modulation fluorometry and oxygen production), and chl a
   content. Specimens were exposed in flow-through aquaria for up to seven
   weeks to combinations of two pCO(2) (similar to 790 and similar to 490 A
   mu atm) and two temperature (28 and 31 A degrees C) regimes. Elevated
   temperature had negative effects on the physiology of both species.
   Elevated pCO(2) had negative effects on growth and apparent
   photosynthetic rate in H.depressa but a positive effect on effective
   quantum yield. With increasing pCO(2), chl a content decreased in H.
   depressa and increased in M. vertebralis. The strongest stress responses
   were observed when the two stressors acted in combination. An
   interaction term was statistically significant in half of the measured
   parameters. Further exploration revealed that 75 \% of these cases
   showed a synergistic (= larger than additive) interaction between the
   two stressors. These results indicate that negative physiological
   effects on photosymbiont-bearing coral reef Foraminifera are likely to
   be stronger under simultaneous acidification and temperature rise than
   what would be expected from the effect of each of the stressors

Title = {High salinity tolerance of the Red Sea coral Fungia granulosa under
   desalination concentrate discharge conditions: an in situ
   photophysiology experiment},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {1},
Abstract = {Seawater reverse osmosis desalination concentrate may have chronic
   and/or acute impacts on the marine ecosystems in the near-field area of
   the discharge. Environmental impact of the desalination plant discharge
   is supposedly site- and volumetric- specific, and also depends on the
   salinity tolerance of the organisms inhabiting the water column in and
   around a discharge environment. Scientific studies that aim to
   understand possible impacts of elevated salinity levels are important to
   assess detrimental effects to organisms, especially for species with no
   mechanism of osmoregulation, e.g., presumably corals. Previous studies
   on corals indicate sensitivity toward hypo- and hyper-saline
   environments with small changes in salinity already affecting coral
   physiology. In order to evaluate sensitivity of Red Sea corals to
   increased salinity levels, we conducted a long-term (29 days) in situ
   salinity tolerance transect study at an offshore seawater reverse
   osmosis (SWRO) discharge on the coral Fungia granulosa. While we
   measured a pronounced increase in salinity and temperature at the direct
   outlet of the discharge structure, effects were indistinguishable from
   the surrounding environment at a distance of 5 m. Interestingly, corals
   were not affected by varying salinity levels as indicated by
   measurements of the photosynthetic efficiency. Similarly, cultured coral
   symbionts of the genus Symbiodinium displayed remarkable tolerance
   levels in regard to hypo- and hypersaline treatments. Our data suggest
   that increased salinity and temperature levels from discharge outlets
   wear off quickly in the surrounding environment. Furthermore, F.
   granulosa seem to tolerate levels of salinity that are distinctively
   higher than reported for other corals previously. It remains to be
   determined whether Red Sea corals in general display increased salinity
   tolerance, and whether this is related to prevailing levels of high(er)
   salinity in the Red Sea in comparison to other oceans.},

   implications for soil carbon dynamics},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The direction and magnitude of climate warming effects on ecosystem
   processes such as carbon cycling remain uncertain. Soil fungi are
   central to these processes due to their roles as decomposers of soil
   organic matter, as mycorrhizal symbionts, and as determinants of plant
   diversity. Yet despite their importance to ecosystem functioning, we
   lack a clear understanding of the long-term response of soil fungal
   communities to warming. Toward this goal, we characterized soil fungal
   communities in two replicated soil warming experiments at the Harvard
   Forest (Petersham, Massachusetts, USA) which had experienced 5 degrees C
   above ambient soil temperatures for 5 and 20 yr at the time of sampling.
   We assessed fungal diversity and community composition by sequencing the
   ITS2 region of rDNA using Illumina technology, along with soil C
   concentrations and chemistry. Three main findings emerged: (1) long-,
   but not short-term warming resulted in compositional shifts in the soil
   fungal community, particularly in the saprotrophic and unknown
   components of the community; (2) soil C concentrations and the total C
   stored in the organic horizon declined in response to both short- (5 yr)
   and long-term (20 yr) warming; and (3) following long-term warming,
   shifts in fungal guild relative abundances were associated with
   substantial changes in soil organic matter chemistry, particularly the
   relative abundance of lignin. Taken together, our results suggest that
   shifts with warming in the relative abundance of fungal functional
   groups and dominant fungal taxa are related to observed losses in total
   soil C.},

Abstract = {Global degradation of coral reefs has increased the urgency of
   identifying stress-tolerant coral populations, to enhance understanding
   of the biology driving stress tolerance, as well as identifying stocks
   of stress-hardened populations to aid reef rehabilitation. Surprisingly,
   scientists are continually discovering that naturally extreme
   environments house established coral populations adapted to grow within
   extreme abiotic conditions comparable to seawater conditions predicted
   over the coming century. Such environments include inshore mangrove
   lagoons that carry previously unrecognised ecosystem service value for
   corals, spanning from refuge to stress preconditioning. However, the
   existence of such hot-spots of resilience on the Great Barrier Reef
   (GBR) remains entirely unknown. Here we describe, for the first time, 2
   extreme GBR mangrove lagoons (Woody Isles and Howick Island), exposing
   taxonomically diverse coral communities (34 species, 7 growth
   morphologies) to regular extreme low pH (<7.6), low oxygen (<1 mg l(-1))
   and highly variable temperature range (>7 degrees C) conditions. Coral
   cover was typically low (<5 \%), but highly patchy and included
   established colonies (>0.5 m diameter), with net photosynthesis and
   calcification rates of 2 dominant coral species (Acropora millepora,
   Porites lutea) reduced (20-30 \%), and respiration enhanced (11-35 \%),
   in the mangrove lagoon relative to adjacent reefs. Further analysis
   revealed that physiological plasticity (photosynthetic `strategy') and
   flexibility of Symbiodiniaceae taxa associations appear crucial in
   supporting coral capacity to thrive from reef to lagoon. Prevalence of
   corals within these extreme conditions on the GBR (and elsewhere)
   increasingly challenge our understanding of coral resilience to
   stressors, and highlight the need to study unfavourable coral
   environments to better resolve mechanisms of stress tolerance.},

Abstract = {The threats of wide-scale coral bleaching and reef demise associated
   with anthropogenic climate change are widely known. Moreover, rates of
   genetic adaptation and/or changes in the coral-zooxanthella partnerships
   are considered unlikely to be sufficiently fast for corals to acquire
   increased physiological resistance to increasing sea temperatures and
   declining pH. However, it has been suggested that coral reef resilience
   to climate change may be improved by good local management of coral
   reefs, including management of water quality. Here, using major data
   sets from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, we investigate
   geographic patterns of coral bleaching in 1998 and 2002 and outline a
   synergism between heat stress and nutrient flux as a major causative
   mechanism for those patterns. The study provides the first concrete
   evidence for the oft-expressed belief that improved coral reef
   management will increase the regional-scale survival prospects of coral
   reefs to global climate change.},

B. and Wall, Christopher B. and Cunning, Ross and Dove, Sophie and Gates, Ruth D.",High light alongside elevated <i>P</i><sub>CO</sub><sub>2</sub> alleviates thermal depression of photosynthesis in a hard coral (<i>Pocillopora acuta</i>),JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,2020,223,20,NA,OCT,"The absorbtion of human-emitted CO2 by the oceans (elevated P-CO2) is projected to alter the physiological performance of coral reef organisms by perturbing seawater chemistry (i.e. ocean acidification). Simultaneously, greenhouse gas emissions are driving ocean warming and changes in irradiance (through turbidity and cloud cover), which have the potential to influence the effects of ocean acidification on coral reefs. Here, we explored whether physiological impacts of elevated P-CO2, on a coral-algal symbiosis (Pocillopora acuta-Symbiodiniaceae) are mediated by light and/or temperature levels. In a 39 day experiment, elevated P-CO2 (962 versus 431 patm P-CO2) had an interactive effect with midday light availability (400 versus 800 pmol photons m(-2) s(-1)) and temperature (25 versus 29 degrees C) on areal gross and net photosynthesis, for which a decline at 29 degrees C was ameliorated under simultaneous high-Pm and high-light conditions. Light-enhanced dark respiration increased under elevated P-CO2 and/or elevated temperature. Symbiont to host cell ratio and chlorophyll a per symbiont increased at elevated temperature, whilst symbiont areal density decreased. The ability of moderately strong light in the presence of elevated P-CO2 to alleviate the temperature-induced decrease in photosynthesis suggests that higher substrate availability facilitates a greater ability for photochemical quenching, partially offsetting the impacts of high temperature on the photosynthetic apparatus. Future environmental changes that result in moderate increases in light levels could therefore assist the P. acuta holobiont to cope with the `one-two punch' of rising temperatures in the presence of an acidifying ocean.",COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",English,"Mason, RAB (Corresponding Author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean \& Earth Sci \& Technol, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, POB 1346, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.

To understand how heating rate modulates the holobiont response to thermal challenge, we compared the effects of acute heat shock and cumulative thermal exposures on Acropora cervicornis from Southeast Florida (26 degrees 06 N, 80 degrees 05 W). In March of 2017, maximum dark-adapted yield of photosystem II (F-V/F-M), rates of dark respiration (R), and rates of gross photosynthesis (P-g) were measured at temperatures spanning 25-36 degrees C. Thermal performance curves of each response variable were constructed as a function of temperature and thermal dose (i.e., degree heating minutes). Acute exposure (i.e., instantaneously increasing temperature by between 2.5 and 10 degrees C) resulted in a more marked decline in physiology despite a lower thermal dose, compared to the cumulative exposure (2.5 degrees C h(-1)). Apparent deficits in coral holobiont metabolism were observed as a function of both temperature and thermal dose, but examination of holobiont metabolism in a dose-context revealed more pronounced differences between acute and cumulative exposures. Subtle physiological differences may be more easily identified and better cross-study comparisons of cnidarian thermal tolerance may be achieved by placing temperature exposures in degree heating times. In addition, the ratio of daily P-g:R fell below 1 when temperatures exceeded 32 degrees C, corroborating prior observations that P-g:R may be a means of identifying physiological deficits in advance of visual signs of dysbiosis, such as bleaching.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",English,"Martell, HA (Corresponding Author), Old Dominion Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.

We used a ``press-pulse-press{''} experimental framework to expose the brooding coral Porites astreoides to various thermal histories to understand the physiological response of temporal dynamics within and across generations. We collected adult colonies from two reefs (outer Rim reef and inner Patch reef) in Bermuda with naturally contrasting thermal regimes as our initial ``press{''} scenario, followed by a 21-day ex situ ``pulse{''} thermal stress of 30.4 degrees C during larval brooding, and a ``press{''} year-long adult reciprocal transplant between the original sites. Higher endosymbiont density and holobiont protein was found in corals originating from the lower thermal variability site (Rim) compared to the higher thermal variability site (Patch). The thermal pulse event drove significant declines in photosynthesis, endosymbiont density, and chlorophyll a, with bleaching phenotype convergence for adults from both histories. Following the reciprocal transplant, photosynthesis was higher in previously heated corals, indicating recovery from the thermal pulse. The effect of origin (initial press) modulated the response to transplant site for endosymbiont density and chlorophyll a, suggesting contrasting acclimation strategies. Higher respiration and photosynthetic rates were found in corals originating from the Rim site, indicating greater energy available for reproduction, supported by larger larvae released from Rim corals post-transplantation. Notably, parental exposure to the pulse thermal event resulted in increased offspring plasticity when parents were transplanted to foreign sites, highlighting the legacy of the pulse event and the importance of the environment during recovery in contributing to cross-generational or developmental plasticity.

Intervention strategies intended for the restoration of degraded reef habitats need a better understanding of the influence of ocean warming and acidification on coral health to target coral species and individual genotypes that may be more resistant or resilient to such stressors. Here, we examined a suite of physiological traits (coral host and algal symbiont) in response to experimentally elevated water temperatures and pCO(2) levels, both separately and in concert, using threatened reef-building corals Pseudodiploria clivosa and Orbicella faveolata reared within a land-based coral nursery. After two months of exposure, responses differed by coral species, where P. clivosa showed declined physiology in response to combined ocean warming and acidification stress and ocean warming alone, whereas O. faveolata showed a positive response under ocean acidification. Responses to temperature could be associated with the algal symbionts harbored, as P. clivosa was dominated by the thermally sensitive Breviolum, and O. faveolata was dominated by the thermally tolerant Durusdinium. Additionally, corals were raised in well-sourced seawater that was naturally high in pCO(2), which could have led to corals acclimating to acidified conditions. Of the three P. clivosa genets tested, we determined a top-performing genotype under the combined warming and acidification treatment. O. faveolata, however, displayed high genet variation by treatment and phenotypic trait, making genotype performance rankings challenging to discern. The evidence provided in this study demonstrates that high phenotypic variation in nursery-reared corals contributes to variable warming-acidification responses, suggesting that high-standing genetic variation in nursery-reared corals could support diverse coral restoration population outcomes along FCR.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",English,"Klepac, CN (Corresponding Author), Int Ctr Coral Reef Res \& Restorat, Mote Marine Lab, Summerland Key, FL 33042 USA.

Most studies to date have focused on the destabilization of coral-dinoflagellate symbioses due to warming oceans, or declining calcification due to ocean acidification. In our study, pH and temperature conditions consistent with the end-of-century scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) caused major changes in photosynthesis and respiration, in addition to decreased calcification rates in the coral Acropora millepora. Population density of symbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium) under high levels of ocean acidification and temperature (Representative Concentration Pathway, RCP8.5) decreased to half of that found under present day conditions, with photosynthetic and respiratory rates also being reduced by 40\%. These physiological changes were accompanied by evidence for gene regulation of calcium and bicarbonate transporters along with components of the organic matrix. Meta-transcriptomic RNA-Seq data analyses showed an overall down regulation of metabolic transcripts, and an increased abundance of transcripts involved in circadian clock control, controlling the damage of oxidative stress, calcium signaling/homeostasis, cytoskeletal interactions, transcription regulation, DNA repair, Wnt signaling and apoptosis/immunity/toxins. We suggest that increased maintenance costs under ocean acidification and warming, and diversion of cellular ATP to pH homeostasis, oxidative stress response, UPR and DNA repair, along with metabolic suppression, may underpin why Acroporid species tend not to thrive under future environmental stress.

In this study, we exposed larvae from the brooding coral Pocillopora damicornis to contrasts of temperature (24.00 degrees C {[}ambient] versus 30.49 degrees C) and pCO(2) (49.4 Pa versus 862 Pa) for varying periods (1-5 days) to test the hypothesis that exposure duration had no effect on larval response as assessed by protein content, respiration, Symbiodinium density, and survivorship; exposure times were ecologically relevant compared to representative pelagic larval durations (PLO) for corals. Larvae differed among days for all response variables, and the effects of the treatment were relatively consistent regardless of exposure duration for three of the four response variables. Protein content and Symbiodinium density were unaffected by temperature and pCO(2), but respiration increased with temperature (but not pCO(2)) with the effect intensifying as incubations lengthened. Survival, however, differed significantly among treatments at the end of the study, and by the 5th day, 78\% of the larvae were alive and swimming under ambient temperature and ambient pCO(2), but only 55-59\% were alive in the other treatments. These results demonstrate that the physiological effects of temperature and pCO(2) on coral larvae can reliably be detected within days, but effects on survival require days to detect. The detection of time-dependent effects on larval survivorship suggests that the influence of GCC and OA will be stronger for corals having long PLDs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The relationship between coral physiology and its microbiome may reveal why some corals are more resilient to these global change conditions. Here, we conducted the first experiment to simultaneously investigate changes in the coral microbiome and coral physiology in response to the dual stress of elevated seawater temperature and ocean acidification expected by the end of this century. Two species of corals, Acropora millepora containing the thermally sensitive endosymbiont C21a and Turbinaria reniformis containing the thermally tolerant endosymbiont Symbiodinium trenchi, were exposed to control (26.5 degrees C and pCO(2) of 364 mu atm) and treatment (29.0 degrees C and pCO(2) of 750 mu atm) conditions for 24 days, after which we measured the microbial community composition. These microbial findings were interpreted within the context of previously published physiological measurements from the exact same corals in this study (calcification, organic carbon flux, ratio of photosynthesis to respiration, photosystem II maximal efficiency, total lipids, soluble animal protein, soluble animal carbohydrates, soluble algal protein, soluble algal carbohydrate, biomass, endosymbiotic algal density, and chlorophyll a). Overall, dually stressed A. millepora had reduced microbial diversity, experienced large changes in microbial community composition, and experienced dramatic physiological declines in calcification, photosystem II maximal efficiency, and algal carbohydrates. In contrast, the dually stressed coral T. reniformis experienced a stable and more diverse microbiome community with minimal physiological decline, coupled with very high total energy reserves and particulate organic carbon release rates. Thus, the microbiome changed and microbial diversity decreased in the physiologically sensitive coral with the thermally sensitive endosymbiotic algae but not in the physiologically tolerant coral with the thermally tolerant endosymbiont. Our results confirm recent findings that temperature-stress tolerant corals have a more stable microbiome, and demonstrate for the first time that this is also the case under the dual stresses of ocean warming and acidification. We propose that coral with a stable microbiome are also more physiologically resilient and thus more likely to persist in the future, and shape the coral species diversity of future reef ecosystems.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",English,"Grottoli, AG (Corresponding Author), Ohio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.

We used a phylogenetically controlled design to investigate the role of vertical symbiont transmission, an evolutionary mechanism in which symbionts are inherited directly from parents, predicted to enhance cooperation and holobiont fitness. Six species of coral, three vertical transmitters and their closest horizontally transmitting relatives, which exhibit environmental acquisition of symbionts, were fragmented and subjected to a 2-week thermal stress experiment. Symbiont cell density, photosynthetic function and translocation of photosynthetically fixed carbon between symbionts and hosts were quantified to assess changes in physiological performance and cooperation. All species exhibited similar decreases in symbiont cell density and net photosynthesis in response to elevated temperature, consistent with the onset of bleaching. Yet baseline cooperation, or translocation of photosynthate, in ambient conditions and the reduction in cooperation in response to elevated temperature differed among species. Although Porites lobata and Galaxea acrhelia did exhibit the highest levels of baseline cooperation, we did not observe universally higher levels of cooperation in vertically transmitting species. Post hoc sequencing of the Symbiodinium ITS-2 locus was used to investigate the potential role of differences in symbiont community composition. Interestingly, reductions in cooperation at the onset of bleaching tended to be associated with increased symbiont community diversity among coral species. The theoretical benefits of evolving vertical transmission are based on the underlying assumption that the host-symbiont relationship becomes genetically uniform, thereby reducing competition among symbionts. Taken together, our results suggest that it may not be vertical transmission per se that influences host-symbiont cooperation, but genetic uniformity of the symbiont community, although additional work is needed to test this hypothesis.",PEERJ INC,"341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND",English,"Kenkel, CD (Corresponding Author), Univ Southern Calif, Dept Biol Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.

Assessing the capability of reef-building corals to expand their tolerance limits to survive projected climate trajectories is critical for their protection and management. Acclimation mechanisms such as developmental plasticity may provide one means by which corals could cope with projected ocean warming and acidification. To assess the potential of preconditioning to enhance thermal tolerance in the coral Pocillopora acuta, colonies were kept under three different scenarios from settlement to 17 months old: present day (0.9 \& DEG;C-weeks (Degree Heating Weeks), + 0.75 \& DEG;C annual, 400 ppm pCO(2)) mid-century (2.5 \& DEG;C-weeks, + 1.5 \& DEG;C annual, 685 ppm pCO(2)) and end of century (5 \& DEG;C-weeks, + 2 \& DEG;C annual, 900 ppm pCO(2)) conditions. Colonies from the present-day scenario were subsequently introduced to the mid-century and end of century conditions for six weeks during summer thermal maxima to examine if preconditioned colonies (reared under these elevated conditions) had a higher physiological performance compared to naive individuals. Symbiodiniaceae density and chlorophyll a concentrations were significantly lower in mid-century and end of century preconditioned groups, and declines in symbiont density were observed over the six-week accumulated heat stress in all treatments. Maximum photosynthetic rate was significantly suppressed in mid-century and end of century preconditioned groups, while minimum saturating irradiances were highest for 2050 pre-exposed individuals with parents originating from specific populations. The results of this study indicate preconditioning to elevated temperature and pCO(2) for 17 months did not enhance the physiological performance in P. acuta. However, variations in trait responses and effects on tolerance found among treatment groups provides evidence for differential capacity for phenotypic plasticity among populations which could have valuable applications for future restoration efforts.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"Roper, CD (Corresponding Author), Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia.

Mesophotic ecosystems have been suggested to play a major role as refugia for coral reef sponge species, however knowledge regarding the ability of mesophotic sponges to cope with thermal stress is scarce. In this study we compared the response of the sponge Diacarnus erythraeanus, a widespread Red Sea sponge, from the shallow and mesophotic reef, to moderate and acute temperature elevation (2 degrees C and 6 degrees C, respectively) for short and long term periods (two and 35 days, respectively) by measuring physiological parameters (respiration, oxygen removal, pumping rates, and photosynthetic efficiency), and the microbiome composition change. The results indicated that mesophotic and shallow populations of D. erythraeanus are highly tolerant to both moderate and acute heat stress, demonstrating a high survival rate (100\%) across the experimental treatments, with no visible signs of bleaching or necrosis. Exposure to heat stress resulted in significant alterations in the physiological parameters of sponges, including higher respiration rate and lower photosynthetic efficiency. These alterations were accompanied by correspondingly significant microbial adjustments, thus emphasizing the essential role of the microbiome in the host's ability to persist when facing essential environmental stress. Moreover, while shallow and mesophotic sponges showed similar physiological tolerance to heat stress, their microbial response differed: while the microbiome diversity of the mesophotic sponges remained stable throughout the experiment, the shallow one significantly changed. This result suggests that their underlying coping mechanisms might differ between mesophotic and shallow populations. Since the associated-microbiome is largely regulated by the sponge-host genetics, difference in microbial adjustments to stress between populations, could indicate genetic variability between hosts. Therefore, while the results of this study support the hypothesis that mesophotic coral reefs could serve as thermal refugia for some sponge species, it raises the question regarding the validity of MCEs as a refuge for shallow populations. Finally, it emphasizes the crucial need to elucidate the underlying mechanisms governing the sponge-microbiome interactions, specifically in the context of the anticipated climate change scenarios.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",English,"Raijman-Nagar, L (Corresponding Author), Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Life Sci, Sch Zool, Tel Aviv, Israel.

We thus investigated the ecophysiological response of the pulsating soft coral Xenia umbellata to different levels of nitrate eutrophication (control = 0.6, medium = 6, high = 37 mu M nitrate) in a laboratory experiment, with additional warming (27.7 to 32.8 degrees C) from days 17 to 37. High nitrate eutrophication enhanced cellular chlorophyll a content of Symbiodiniaceae by 168\%, while it reduced gross photosynthesis by 56\%. After additional warming, polyp pulsation rate was reduced by 100\% in both nitrate eutrophication treatments, and additional polyp loss of 7\% d(-1) and total fragment mortality of 26\% was observed in the high nitrate eutrophication treatment. Warming alone did not affect any of the investigated response parameters. These results suggest that X. umbellata exhibits resistance to warming, which may facilitate ecological dominance over some hard corals as ocean temperatures warm, though a clear negative physiological response occurs when combined with nitrate eutrophication.

Densitometry and visual inspection indicated that polyps bleached while stolons did not. When migration was triggered by temperature, light and confinement, colonies of Sarcothelia sp. decreased rates of oxygen formation in the light (due to the effects of perturbation on photosynthesis and respiration) and increased rates of oxygen uptake in the dark (due to the effects of perturbation on respiration alone). Colonies of P. parrini, by contrast, showed no significant changes in either aspect of oxygen metabolism. When migration was triggered by light and confinement, colonies of Sarcothelia sp. showed decreased rates of oxygen formation in the light and increased rates of oxygen uptake in the dark, while colonies of P. parrini maintained the former and increased the latter. During symbiont migration into their stolons, colonies of both species showed dramatic increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS), as visualized with a fluorescent probe, with stolons of Sarcothelia sp. exhibiting a nearly immediate increase of ROS. Differences in symbiont type may explain the greater sensitivity of colonies of Sarcothelia sp. Using fluorescent probes, direct measurements of migrating symbionts in the stolons of Sarcothelia sp. showed higher levels of reactive nitrogen species and lower levels of ROS than the surrounding host tissue. As measured by native fluorescence, levels of NAD(P) H in the stolons were unaffected by perturbation.

An underwater respirometer has been designed to make routine, diver-operated, non-invasive measurements at coral surfaces, but the realistic in situ accuracy and precision capabilities of this device has not been critically assessed; an essential step if these measurements are to be useful for quantifying spatial and seasonal patterns of coral metabolism. We developed specific protocols for this system to survey shallow coral colonies and detect metabolic profiles (respiration, photosynthesis, and biocalcification), diel cycles (day and night), and photosynthesis-irradiance curves. Analysis of data from in situ and laboratory-controlled conditions showed good replication among coral colonies and high precision measurements of temperature, oxygen and pH fluxes over 15-min incubation times without noticeable detrimental effects on coral health. Moreover, marked differences were observed in coral calcification rates between estuarine-influenced and coastal marine conditions, despite the absence of significant differences in visual appearance or other health indicators, revealing the system's potential for early detection of marginally adverse conditions for coral metabolism. Its ease of operation and rapid quantification of the physiological status of the corals make this respirometer well suited for use by reef scientists, monitoring agencies, and stakeholders in biogenic reefs conservation efforts.

Here, we report 2 long-term (10-11 month) studies assessing the effects of temperature (25 and 28 degrees C) and both high and low seawater pCO(2) (180-750 mu atm) on the calcification, photosynthesis and respiration of individual massive Porites spp. genotypes. Calcification rates were highly variable between genotypes, but high seawater pCO(2) reduced calcification significantly in 4 of 7 genotypes cultured at 25 degrees C but in only 1 of 4 genotypes cultured at 28 degrees C. Increasing seawater temperature enhanced calcification in almost all corals, but the magnitude of this effect was seawater pCO(2) dependent. The 3 degrees C temperature increase enhanced calcification rate on average by 3\% at 180 mu atm, by 35\% at 260 mu atm and by > 300\% at 750 mu atm. The rate increase at high seawater pCO(2) exceeds that observed in inorganic aragonites. Responses of gross/net photosynthesis and respiration to temperature and seawater pCO(2) varied between genotypes, but rates of all these processes were reduced at the higher seawater temperature. Increases in seawater temperature, below the thermal stress threshold, may mitigate against ocean acidification in this coral genus, but this moderation is not mediated by an increase in net photosynthesis. The response of coral calcification to temperature cannot be explained by symbiont productivity or by thermodynamic and kinetic influences on aragonite formation.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"Allison, N (Corresponding Author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Earth \& Environm Sci, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland.

Rising seawater temperature and high ultraviolet radiation (UVR) levels are the main drivers of the disruption of the coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis (bleaching). Bleaching can also be exacerbated by nitrate contamination in coastal reefs. However, the underlying physiological mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here, we assessed the physiological and oxidative state of the scleractinian coral Pocillopora damicornis, maintained eight weeks in a crossed-factorial design including two temperatures (26 degrees C or 30 degrees C), and two nitrate (0.5 and 3 mu M-enriched), and UVR (no UVR and 25/ 1.5 Wm(-2) UVA/B) levels. Nitrate enrichment, and high temperature, significantly impaired coral photosynthesis. However, UVR alleviated the nitrate and temperature-induced decrease in photosynthesis, by increasing the coral's antioxidant capacity. The present study contributes to our understanding of the combined effects of abiotic stressors on coral bleaching susceptibility.

We studied the effects of high seawater temperature and bacterial challenges on bleaching, metabolism, and antioxidant defenses of coral. The coral Montipora digitate and five bacterial strains (Vibrio coralliilyticus, Vibrio harveyi, Paracoccus carotinifaciens, Pseudoalteromonas sp., and Sulfitobacter sp.) were used in an inoculation experiment. The bacteria were isolated from the bleached corals and their surrounding seawater. At normal temperatures, the bacteria did not cause coral bleaching and did not affect metabolism or antioxidant enzyme activities. However, bacterial challenges in addition to high-temperature stress resulted in coral bleaching, with a 70\% decrease in zooxanthellae density compared with the control, a 25\% decrease in photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm), a 66\% decrease in photosynthesis, and a 101\% reduction in calcification activity. Tissue necrosis was observed in the most compromised branches. Respiration and activity levels of antioxidant enzymes were not affected. Corals under thermal stress alone showed signs of bleaching, but the changes in zooxanthellae density and metabolic rates were less severe than those under synergistic thermal stress and bacterial challenge. Among the bacteria examined, Sulfitobacter sp. had a greater capacity to enhance and accelerate the bleaching process under thermal stress. The mechanisms by which bacteria affect corals are not yet understood. Direct actions include infection and production of toxic substances by bacteria; indirect effects due to changes in the bacterial community under the influence of added bacteria must also be considered. Our results suggest that bacterial challenges combined with thermal stress can synergistically lead to negative outcomes in corals. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we test the impact of temperature (mean similar to 27 degrees C vs. similar to 29 degrees C) and nitrate and phosphate enrichment (ambient, + 5 mu M nitrate, + 1 mu M phosphate and combined + 5 mu M nitrate with 1 mu M phosphate) on coral larvae using three Hawaiian coral species with different modes of symbiont transmission and reproduction: Lobactis scutaria (horizontal, gonochoric broadcast spawner), Pocillopora acuta (vertical, hermaphroditic brooder) and Montipora capitata (vertical, hermaphroditic broadcast spawner). Temperature and nutrient effects were species specific and appear antagonistic for L. scutaria and M. capitata, but not for P. acuta. Larvae survivorship in all species was lowest under nitrate enrichment at 27 degrees C. M. capitata and L. scutaria survivorship increased at 29 degrees C. However, positive effects of warming on survivorship were lost under high nitrate, but phosphate attenuated nitrate effects when N/P ratios were balanced. P. acuta larvae exhibited high survivorship (> 91\%) in all treatments and showed little change in larval size, but lower respiration rates at 29 degrees C. Elevated nutrients (+N+P) led to the greatest loss in larvae size for aposymbiotic L. scutaria, while positive growth in symbiotic M. capitata larvae was reduced under warming and highest in +N+P treatments. Overall, we report a greater sensitivity of broadcast spawners to warming and nutrient changes compared to a brooding coral species. These results suggest variability in biological responses to warming and nutrient enrichment is influenced by life-history traits, including the presence of symbionts (vertical transmission), in addition to nutrient type and nutrient stoichiometry.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"Wall, CB (Corresponding Author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, 46-007 Lilipuna Rd, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.

Photosynthesis and respiration rates were evaluated from the oxygen fluxes from and to the coral polyps. High-temperature alone lowered both photosynthetic and respiration rates. High pCO(2) alone did not significantly affect either photosynthesis or respiration rates. Under a combination of high-temperature and high-CO2, the photosynthetic rate increased to values close to those of the controls. The same pH in the diffusion boundary layer was observed under light in both (400 and 750 ppm) CO2 treatments, but decreased significantly in the dark as a result of increased CO2. The ATP contents decreased with increasing temperature. The effects of temperature on the metabolism of corals were stronger than the effects of increased CO2. The effects of acidification were minimal without combined temperature stress. However, acidification combined with higher temperature may affect coral metabolism due to the amplification of diel variations in the microenvironment surrounding the coral and the decrease in ATP contents.

Ocean warming and acidification cause bleaching and mortality, and decrease calcification in adult corals, leading to changes in the composition of coral communities; however. their interactive effects on coral larvae are not comprehensively understood. To examine the underlying molecular mechanisms of larval responses to elevated temperature and pCO(2), we examined the physiological performance and protein expression profiles of Pocillopora damicornis at two temperatures (29 and 33 degrees C) and pCO(2) levels (500 and 1000 mu atm) for 5 d. Extensive physiological and proteomic changes were observed in coral larvae. The results indicated a significant decrease in net photosynthesis (P-NET) and autotrophic capability (P-NET/R-D) of larvae exposed to elevated temperature but a marked increase in P-NET and P-NET/R-D of larvae exposed to high pCO(2) levels. Elevated temperature significantly reduced endosymbiont densities by 70\% and photochemical efficiency, indicating that warming impaired host-symbiont symbiosis. Expression of photosynthesis-related proteins, the photosystem (PS) I reaction center subunits IV and XI as well as oxygen-evolving enhancer 1, was downregulated at higher temperatures in symbionts, whereas expression of the PS I iron-sulfur center protein was increased under high pCO(2) conditions. Furthermore, expression of phosphoribulokinase (involved in the Calvin cycle) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (related to the C-4 pathway) was downregulated in symbionts under thermal stress; this finding suggests reduced carbon fixation at high temperatures. The abundance of carbonic anhydrase-associated proteins, which are predicted to exert biochemical roles in dissolved inorganic carbon transport in larvae, was reduced in coral host and symbionts at high temperatures. These results elucidate potential mechanisms underlying the responses of coral larvae exposed to elevated temperature and acidification and suggest an important role of symbionts in the response to warming and acidification.

In whole corals, O-2 production at 26 degrees C was significantly limited at C-i concentrations below ambient seawater (similar to 2.2 mM). Further additions of C-i up to similar to 10 mM caused no further stimulation of oxygenic photosynthesis. Following exposure to 30 degrees C (2 d), net oxygen production decreased significantly in whole corals, as a result of reduced production of photosynthetically derived oxygen rather than increased host consumption. Whole corals maintained a rate of oxygen evolution around eight times lower than cultured Symbiodinium sp. at inorganic carbon concentrations < 2 mM, but cultures displayed greater levels of photoinhibition following heat treatment (30 degrees C, 2 d). Whole corals and cultured zooxanthellae differed considerably in their responses to C-i concentration and moderate heat stress, demonstrating that cultured Symbiodinium make an incongruous model for those in hospite. Reduced net oxygen evolution, in whole corals, under conditions of low C-i (< 2 mM) has been interpreted in terms of possible sink limitation leading to increased nonphotochemical energy dissipation. The advantages of combined measurement of net gas exchange and fluorometry offered by this method are discussed.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Ralph, P (Corresponding Author), Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Water \& Environm Resource Management, Dept Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.

We exposed larvae to two temperatures (29 vs. 30.8 degrees C) crossed with two pCO(2) levels (similar to 500 vs. similar to 1000 mu atm) in a full-factorial experiment for 5 d. Larval performance was assessed as dark respiration (R-D), net and gross photosynthesis (P-N and P-G, respectively), survival, settlement, and the activity of carbonic anhydrase (CA), the central enzyme involved in photosynthesis. The results showed that R-D was unaffected by either elevated temperature or pCO(2), while elevated temperature and/or pCO(2) stimulated P-N and P-G and increased the ratios of P-N to R-D, indicating a relatively higher autotrophic capacity. Consequently, larval survivorship under elevated temperature and/or pCO(2) was consistently 14\% higher than that under the control treatment. Furthermore, elevated temperature and pCO(2) did not affect host CA activity, but synergistically enhanced symbiont CA activity, contributing greatly to the stimulated photosynthetic capacity. These results suggest that brooded larvae of P. damicornis larvae from Luhuitou may be preadapted to cope with projected warming and ocean acidification. More generally, it appears that corals from highly variable environments may have increased resilience to the widespread climate change.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"Huang, H (Corresponding Author), Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Trop Marine Bioresources \& Ecol, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Appl Marine Biol, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, Guangzhou 510301, Peoples R China.

On coral reefs, symbiont-bearing large benthic foraminifera (LBFs) can play a key role as reef constituents and carbonate producers, contributing up to 5\% of reef-scale carbonate budgets. However, projected climate change, particularly ocean warming, has the potential to significantly alter the conditions in which marine organisms persist. While the response of LBFs to elevated thermal stress is well documented in laboratory studies, the potential influence of adaptation or acclimatization through prior environmental thermal history on this response remains largely unknown. In this study, specimens of Calcarina gaudichaudii, an LBF from the Penghu Islands, Taiwan, were collected from thermally variable intertidal and thermally stable subtidal (similar to 6 m depth) environments representing thermal history. LBFs were then acclimated to laboratory conditions at ambient (25 degrees C) and elevated (28 degrees C) temperatures for three weeks, and subsequently exposed to control and heat stress treatments (25 degrees C, 28 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 33 degrees C) for an additional one week. Photosynthetic rates (determined through oxygen flux measurements) of C. gaudichaudii significantly decreased in specimens collected at subtidal depths acclimated at 25 degrees C when compared to those acclimated at 28 degrees C, whereas there was no effect of thermal history on respiration, indicating that symbiont and holobiont responses may differ in LBFs. Additionally, maximum photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) significantly decreased as a result of heat stress, although bleaching was not visually observed after one week. These results highlight the plastic responses of the algal microbiome and indicate that thermal history, acclimatization temperature, and heat stress interact to affect the physiological status of C. gaudichaudii. This study adds to the growing literature which highlights the larger implications of understanding thermal history as an important factor to consider to better understand how ecosystem processes (e.g., carbonate production) are altered on modern coral reefs.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"Carpenter, GE (Corresponding Author), Northeastern Univ, Ctr Marine Sci, 430 Nahant Rd, Nahant, MA 01908 USA.

Animals themselves are host-microbe ecosystems (holobionts), and the application of ecophysiological approaches can help to understand their functioning. In hard coral holobionts, communities of dinitrogen (N-2)-fixing prokaryotes (diazotrophs) may contribute a functional trait by providing bioavailable nitrogen (N) that could sustain coral productivity under oligotrophic conditions. This study quantified N-2 fixation by diazotrophs associated with four genera of hermatypic corals on a northern Red Sea fringing reef exposed to high seasonality. We found N-2 fixation activity to be 5- to 10-fold higher in summer, when inorganic nutrient concentrations were lowest and water temperature and light availability highest. Concurrently, coral gross primary productivity remained stable despite lower Symbiodinium densities and tissue chlorophyll a contents. In contrast, chlorophyll a content per Symbiodinium cell increased from spring to summer, suggesting that algal cells overcame limitation of N, an essential element for chlorophyll synthesis. In fact, N-2 fixation was positively correlated with coral productivity in summer, when its contribution was estimated to meet 11\% of the Symbiodinium N requirements. These results provide evidence of an important functional role of diazotrophs in sustaining coral productivity when alternative external N sources are scarce.",ROYAL SOC,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",English,"Cardini, U (Corresponding Author), Univ Vienna, Dept Microbiol \& Ecosyst Sci, Div Microbial Ecol, Res Network Chem Meets Microbiol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.

Individual specimens of M. vertebralis were collected from Heron Island on the southern Great Barrier Reef (Australia). They were maintained for 5 weeks at different temperatures (28, 32 A degrees C) and pCO(2) (400, 1,000 A mu atm) levels spanning a range of current and future climate-change scenarios. The photosynthetic capacity of M. vertebralis was measured with O-2 microsensors and a pulse-amplitude-modulated chlorophyll (Chl) fluorometer, in combination with estimates of Chl a and Chl c (2) concentrations and calcification rates. After 5 weeks, control specimens remained unaltered for all parameters. Chlorophyll a concentrations significantly decreased in the specimens at 1,000 A mu atm CO2 for both temperatures, while no change in Chl c (2) concentration was observed. Photoinhibition was observed under elevated CO2 and temperature, with a 70-80 \% decrease in the maximum quantum yield of PSII. There was no net O-2 production at elevated temperatures in both CO2 treatments as compared to the control temperature, supporting that temperature has more impact on photosynthesis and O-2 flux than changes in ambient CO2. Photosynthetic pigment loss and a decrease in photochemical efficiency are thus likely to occur with increased temperature. The elevated CO2 and high temperature treatment also lead to a reduction in calcification rate (from +0.1 to >-0.1 \% day(-1)). Thus, both calcification and photosynthesis of the major sediment-producing foraminifer M. vertebralis appears highly vulnerable to elevated temperature and ocean acidification scenarios predicted in climate-change models.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",English,"Hill, R (Corresponding Author), Univ New S Wales, Ctr Marine Bioinnovat, Sch Biol Earth \& Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.

At 26 degrees C, ammonium supplementation had little effect on the coral physiology. It induced a decrease in symbiont density, compensated by an increase in chlorophyll content per symbiont cell. Organic carbon release was reduced, likely because of a better utilization of the photosynthesized carbon (i.e. incorporation into proteins, kept in the coral tissue). The delta N-15 signatures of the ammonium-enriched symbionts and host tissue were also significantly decreased, by 4 and 2 parts per thousand, respectively, compared with the non-enriched conditions, suggesting a significant uptake of inorganic nitrogen by the holobiont. Under thermal stress, coral colonies that were not nitrogen enriched experienced a drastic decrease in photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments (chlorophyll a, beta-carotene, diadinoxanthin, diatoxanthin and peridinin), followed by a decrease in the rates of photosynthesis and calcification. Organic carbon release was not affected by this thermal stress. Conversely, nitrogen-enriched corals showed an increase in their pigment concentrations, and maintained rates of photosynthesis and calcification at ca. 60\% and 100\% of those measured under control conditions, respectively. However, these corals lost more organic carbon into the environment. Overall, these results indicate that inorganic nitrogen availability can be important to determining the resilience of some scleractinian coral species to thermal stress, and can have a function equivalent to that of heterotrophic feeding concerning the maintenance of coral metabolism under stress conditions.",COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",English,"BÃ©raud, E (Corresponding Author), Ctr Sci Monaco, Ave St Martin, MC-98000 St Martin, Monaco.

The resulting ocean warming and acidification have transformative impacts on coral reef ecosystems, detrimentally affecting coral physiology and health, and these impacts are predicted to worsen in the near future. In this study, we kept fragments of the symbiotic corals Acropora intermedia (thermally sensitive) and Porites lobata (thermally tolerant) for 7 weeks under an orthogonal design of predicted end-of-century RCP8.5 conditions for temperature and pCO(2) (3.5 degrees C and 570 ppm above present-day, respectively) to unravel how temperature and acidification, individually or interactively, influence metabolic and physiological performance. Our results pinpoint thermal stress as the dominant driver of deteriorating health in both species because of its propensity to destabilize coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis (bleaching). Acidification had no influence on metabolism but had a significant negative effect on skeleton growth, particularly when photosynthesis was absent such as in bleached corals or under dark conditions. Total loss of photosynthesis after bleaching caused an exhaustion of protein and lipid stores and collapse of calcification that ultimately led to A. intermedia mortality. Despite complete loss of symbionts from its tissue, P. lobata maintained small amounts of photosynthesis and experienced a weaker decline in lipid and protein reserves that presumably contributed to higher survival of this species. Our results indicate that ocean warming and acidification under business-as-usual CO2 emission scenarios will likely extirpate thermally sensitive coral species before the end of the century, while slowing the recovery of more thermally tolerant species from increasingly severe mass coral bleaching and mortality. This could ultimately lead to the gradual disappearance of tropical coral reefs globally, and a shift on surviving reefs to only the most resilient coral species.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"van der Zande, RM (Corresponding Author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Coral Reef Ecosyst Lab, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.

The impact of bleaching on coral physiology may be exacerbated when coupled with eutrophication, i.e., increasing plankton, inorganic nutrient concentrations, sedimentation and turbidity due to coastal urbanization. Whereas zooplankton provision (heterotrophy) may alleviate the negative consequences of thermal stress, inorganic nutrient supply may exacerbate them, which creates a paradox. Our experimental study aims to disentangle the effects of these two components of eutrophication on the physiological response of Turbinaria reniformis subject to normal and to a short-term temperature increase. Additionally, three different inorganic nutrient ratios were tested to assess the influence of nutrient stoichiometry on coral physiology: control (ambient SW 0.5 mu M N and 0.1 mu M P), N only (ambient + 2 mu M N) and N+P (ambient + 2 mu M N and + 0.5 mu M P). Our results show a deleterious effect of a 2 mu M nitrate enrichment alone (N) on coral photosynthetic processes under thermal stress as well as on calcification rates when associated with heterotrophy. On the contrary, a coupled nitrate and phosphorus enrichment (N+P) maintained coral metabolism and calcification during thermal stress and enhanced them when combined with heterotrophy. Broadly, our results shed light on the tight relationship existing between inorganic nutrient availability and heterotrophy. Moreover, it assesses the relevance of N: P stoichiometry as a determining factor for the health of the holobiont that may be adapted to specific nutrient ratios in its surrounding environment.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Ezzat, L (Corresponding Author), Ctr Sci Monaco, Marine Dept, Monaco, Monaco.

Excessive seawater temperature destabilises this symbiosis and causes corals to ``bleach,{''} lowering their photosynthetic capacity. Bleaching poses a serious threat to the persistence of coral reefs on a global scale. Despite expanding research on the causes of bleaching, the mechanisms remain a subject of debate. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study determined how light and food availability modulate the effects of temperature stress on photosynthesis in two reef coral species. We quantified the activities of Photosystem II, Photosystem I and whole chain electron transport under combinations of normal and stressful growth temperatures, moderate and high light levels and the presence or absence of feeding of the coral hosts. Our results show that PS1 function is comparatively robust against temperature stress in both species, whereas PS2 and whole chain electron transport are susceptible to temperature stress. In the symbiotic dinoflagellates of Stylophora pistillata the contents of chlorophyll and major photosynthetic complexes were primarily affected by food availability. In Turbinaria reniformis growth temperature was the dominant influence on the contents of the photosynthetic complexes. In both species feeding the host significantly protected photosynthetic function from high temperature stress. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings support the photoinhibition model of coral bleaching and demonstrate that PS1 is not a major site for thermal damage during bleaching events. Feeding mitigates bleaching in two scleractinian corals, so that reef responses to temperature stresses will likely be influenced by the coinciding availabilities of prey for the host.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",English,"Hoogenboom, MO (Corresponding Author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.

Increasing ocean surface temperatures induce frequent coral mass bleaching events-the breakdown of the nutritional photo-symbiosis with intracellular algae (genus: Symbiodinium). Here, we report that Stylophora pistillata from a highly diverse reef in the Gulf of Aqaba showed no signs of bleaching despite spending 1.5 months at 1-2 degrees C above their long-term summer maximum (amounting to 11 degree heating weeks) and a seawater pH of 7.8. Instead, their symbiotic dinoflagellates exhibited improved photochemistry, higher pigmentation and a doubling in net oxygen production, leading to a 51\% increase in primary productivity. Nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry imaging revealed subtle cellular-level shifts in carbon and nitrogen metabolism under elevated temperatures, but overall host and symbiont biomass proxies were not significantly affected. Now living well below their thermal threshold in the Gulf of Aqaba, these corals have been evolutionarily selected for heat tolerance during their migration through the warm Southern Red Sea after the last ice age.

Impacts of global warming, which is generally perceived as the most serious threat to coral reefs today, often coincide with various common anthropogenic disturbances, such as pollution and overharvesting. To better evaluate the impact of global warming, interactions between elevated temperature and background disturbance should be investigated. In this study, the physiological response of the reef-building coral Porites cylindrica was investigated, when exposed to enrichment of dissolved inorganic nitrate (+ 15 muM for 14 days) and elevated seawater temperature ( + 2 C for 48 h), in the absence of particulate food. It was shown that P. cvlindrica was able to tolerate the temperature exposure without losing symbiotic microalgae or chlorophyll pigments, although the photosynthetic capacity was affected. Nitrate enrichment significantly reduced primary production rate, although zooxanthella population density and chlorophyll concentrations were not affected. The combination of elevated temperature and nitrate enrichment produced an even more pronounced reduction of the production rate. Since coral respiration rate remained unaffected by the treatments, this implies that the corals were unable to acclimate to impaired photosynthesis. However, there was no indication of subsequently reduced tissue growth or increased host catabolism based on tissue biomass measurements. On the other hand, all corals, including controls, lost tissue biomass during the exposure, suggesting a dependence on particulate food. Our results imply that corals on nutrient-exposed reefs may be more stressed during periods of elevated temperature, compared to corals in more pristine areas.",SPRINGER-VERLAG,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",English,"Nordemar, I (Corresponding Author), Univ Stockholm, Dept Syst Ecol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.

The overall annual range of seawater temperature in Obhur Creek was between 24.5 degrees C and 33 degrees C . Zooxanthellae abundance and diversity showed seasonal variations: the number of zooxanthellae in P. damicornis was slightly higher than in P. verrucosa, and the abundance of zooxanthellae of both species was low in summer and high during winter. The respiration rate of P. verrucosa did not vary between summer and winter, suggesting compensatory acclimation. In contrast, the respiratory rate in P. damicornis was lower in winter than in summer. During the winter season the metabolic rate was higher in both species owing to the optimum seawater temperature (30 degrees C). As a result of the abundance of zooxanthellae and the optimum seawater temperature, the growth rates of the skeletons of the two coral species were higher in winter and lower in summer. In general, the results showed that P. verrucosa is more flexible with respect to temperature than P. damicornis.

Conversely, the octocoral Briareum asbestinum exhibits both encrusting and upright branching morphologies at the same shallow water habitat, enabling studying physiological differences uncoupled from habitat variation due to depth or reef location. We investigated the mutualism between endosymbiotic dinoflagellate algae, Breviolum spp. (previously clade B Symbiodinium), and these B. asbestinum morphologies at ambient and elevated temperatures. Based on msh1 gene sequences, the host morphologies were genetically similar although they differed in protein content, polyp expansion behavior, and associated Breviolum (B19 for encrusting and B21 for branching B. asbestinum). Due to colony orientation, polyps in encrusting B. asbestinum experienced irradiance levels nearly three times higher than polyps in the branching morph, which probably contributed to the lower photochemical and light absorption efficiencies of the Breviolum in encrusting fragments. The light-limited portion of photosynthesis-irradiance curves and the intracellular chlorophyll concentrations, however, indicated that Breviolum in both morphologies were acclimated to similar internal irradiances. Encrusting B. asbestinum exhibited higher Breviolum density, areal chlorophyll a, and greater photosynthetic rates cm(-2) compared to branching B. asbestinum. Notably, elevated temperature did not cause bleaching in either morphology, as Breviolum and chlorophyll densities did not differ significantly from ambient temperature, although the two morphologies adjusted some of the measured parameters, indicating coping with the stressor.

Anthropogenic CO2 is absorbed by the oceans, leading to decreases in pH and the CaCO3 saturation state (Omega) of the seawater. Elevated pCO(2) was shown to drastically decrease calcification rates in tropical zooxanthellate corals. Here we show, using the Mediterranean zooxanthellate coral Cladocora caespitosa, that an increase in pCO(2), in the range predicted for 2100, does not reduce its calcification rate. Therefore, the conventional belief that calcification rates will be affected by ocean acidification may not be widespread in temperate corals. Seasonal change in temperature is the predominant factor controlling photosynthesis, respiration, calcification and symbiont density. An increase in pCO(2), alone or in combination with elevated temperature, had no significant effect on photosynthesis, photosynthetic efficiency and calcification. The lack of sensitivity C. caespitosa to elevated pCO(2) might be due to its slow growth rates, which seem to be more dependent on temperature than on the saturation state of calcium carbonate in the range projected for the end of the century.",COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",English,"Rodolfo-Metalpa, R (Corresponding Author), IAEA, Marine Environm Labs, 4 Quai Antoine Ier, MC-98000 Principality Of Monaco, Monaco.

Although metals are often considered as toxic substances for corals, some are essential at nanomolar concentrations for physiological processes such as photosynthesis and antioxidant defenses. This study was designed to elucidate, the individual and combined effects of nanomolar seawater enrichment in manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe), on the main physiological traits of Stylophora pistillata, maintained under normal growth and thermal stress conditions. We provide, for the first time, evidence that Mn is a key trace element for coral symbionts, enhancing cellular chlorophyll concentrations, photosynthetic efficiency and gross photosynthetic rates at ambient temperature. Our experiment also highlights the key role of Mn in increasing coral resistance to heat stress-induced bleaching. While Mn-enriched corals did not bleach and did not reduce their rates of photosynthesis and calcification, control corals experienced significant bleaching. On the contrary to Mn, Fe enrichment not only impaired calcification but induced significant bleaching. Such information is an important step towards a better understanding of the response of corals to seawater enrichment in metals.

We conducted an outdoor 22-month experiment to investigate if coral could not just survive, but also physiologically cope, with chronic ocean warming and acidification conditions expected later this century under the Paris Climate Agreement. We recorded survivorship and measured eleven phenotypic traits to evaluate the holobiont responses of Hawaiian coral: color, Symbiodiniaceae density, calcification, photosynthesis, respiration, total organic carbon flux, carbon budget, biomass, lipids, protein, and maximum Artemia capture rate. Survivorship was lowest in Montipora capitata and only some survivors were able to meet metabolic demand and physiologically cope with future ocean conditions. Most M. capitata survivors bleached through loss of chlorophyll pigments and simultaneously experienced increased respiration rates and negative carbon budgets due to a 236\% increase in total organic carbon losses under combined future ocean conditions. Porites compressa and Porites lobata had the highest survivorship and coped well under future ocean conditions with positive calcification and increased biomass, maintenance of lipids, and the capacity to exceed their metabolic demand through photosynthesis and heterotrophy. Thus, our findings show that significant biological diversity within resilient corals like Porites, and some genotypes of sensitive species, will persist this century provided atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are controlled. Since Porites corals are ubiquitous throughout the world's oceans and often major reef builders, the persistence of this resilient genus provides hope for future reef ecosystem function globally.",NATURE PORTFOLIO,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",English,"McLachlan, RH; Grottoli, AG (Corresponding Author), Ohio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, 125 South Oval Mall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.

We examined the influence of prior exposure to high temperature on the photoinhibition-sensitivity of photosynthetic activity in the zooxanthellae of two bleaching-susceptible corals, Stylophora pistillata and Montipora digitata, and two bleaching-tolerant corals, Pachyseris rugosa and Pavona divaricata from Okinawa, Japan. Coral fragments were acclimated either at 24 or 31degreesC for 5 days, and then exposed to high light (1,200 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1)) for 2 h at 24 or 31degreesC. Bleaching-susceptible species acclimated at 31degreesC showed significant increase in photosynthetic activity (P-max) and total chlorophyll content, while bleaching-tolerant species showed the opposite pattern. The rate of dark respiration (R) was significantly higher in fragments acclimated at 31degreesC than in those acclimated at 24degreesC in all investigated coral species. F-v/F-m decreased to a similar extent after high light treatment at 31degreesC in corals acclimated at 24 and 31degreesC in both tolerant and susceptible species. Pmax and chlorophyll content of bleaching-susceptible corals showed a more pronounced decline after high light exposure at 31degreesC than those of bleaching-tolerant species. The extent of reduction in P-max and chlorophyll content was significantly higher in fragments of S. pistillata and M. digitata acclimated at 31degreesC than in those acclimated at 24degreesC. Significant decrease in R was evident only in susceptible species acclimated at 31degreesC and exposed to high light at 31degreesC. These results suggest that mechanisms underlying the thermal acclimation of photosynthesis vary with coral species. A high photosynthetic acclimation potential to temperature might be associated with a response of P-max but not F-v/F-m.

By the 1980s, reduced inflow and drought led to an extensive hypersaline phase in the bay. This phase had a drastic effect on benthic communities within the bay and possibly also on coral communities within the bay and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Physical oceanographic measurements demonstrate the presence of warm, hypersaline, and turbid water on coral reefs offshore from the Florida Keys, especially near passes which conduct water from Florida Bay to the Atlantic Ocean. To examine the effect of Florida Bay water intrusions on coral reefs, we tested for significant effects of two stressors, elevated temperature and salinity, on coral production, respiration, and survival. Elevated temperatures produce significant reductions in photosynthesis, respiration, and net P:R ratios after 6 h of exposure, and elevated salinities produce similar results after 30 h. Exposure to both elevated temperature and salinity produces a highly significant (P > 0.01), but short-term, mitigative interactive effect. The combination of the two stressors was less stressful (for the response variables measured) than the sum of the stressors acting independently. After 36 h of exposure, however, the mitigating effect disappeared and corals exposed to the combined stresses did not survive. A three-dimensional response surface, which predicts P: R ratios as a function of varying salinity and temperature, is used to construct a testable hypothesis to explain recent declines in coral cover on some reefs within Florida Bay and the Florida Keys. We chose salinity and temperature to test a multiple stressor model because they are relatively easy to manipulate. However, any environmentally realistic model must include other potential stressors, such as turbidity, elevated nutrients, and environmental contaminants.",AMER SOC LIMNOLOGY OCEANOGRAPHY,"5400 BOSQUE BLVD, STE 680, WACO, TX 76710-4446 USA",English,"Porter, JW (Corresponding Author), Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, 711 Biol Sci Bldg, Athens, GA 30602 USA.

This study investigated whether preconditioning adult coral Pocillopora damicornis to high temperatures (29 degrees C and 32 degrees C) could better prepare their larvae for heat stress. Results showed that heat-acclimated adults brooded larvae with reduced symbiont density and shifted thermal performance curves. Reciprocal transplant experiments demonstrated higher bleaching resistance and better photosynthetic and autotrophic performance in heat-exposed larvae from acclimated adults compared to unacclimated adults. RNA-seq revealed strong cellular stress responses in larvae from heat-acclimated adults that could have been effective in rescuing host cells from stress, as evidenced by the widespread upregulation of genes involved in cell cycle and mitosis. For symbionts, a molecular coordination between light harvesting, photoprotection and carbon fixation was detected in larvae from heat-acclimated adults, which may help optimize photosynthetic activity and yield under high temperature. Furthermore, heat acclimation led to opposing regulations of symbiont catabolic and anabolic pathways and favoured nutrient translocation to the host and thus a functional symbiosis. Notwithstanding, the improved heat tolerance was paralleled by reduced light-enhanced dark respiration, indicating metabolic depression for energy saving. Our findings suggest that adult heat acclimation can rapidly shift thermal tolerance of brooded coral larvae and provide integrated physiological and molecular evidence for this adaptive plasticity, which could increase climate resilience. However, the metabolic depression may be maladaptive for long-term organismal performance, highlighting the importance of curbing carbon emissions to better protect corals.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Qian, PY (Corresponding Author), Hong Kong Univ Sci \& Technol HKUST, Dept Ocean Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

De -spite that this critical early stage is susceptible to ocean warming and acidification, little is known about the responses of coral larvae to warming and acidification across different biological scales. This study explored the influences of el-evated temperature (29 ? versus 33 ?) and pCO2 (500 mu atm versus 1000 mu atm) on brooded larvae of Pocillopora damicornis at the organismal, cellular and gene expression levels. Heat stress caused bleaching, depressed light-enhanced dark respiration, photosynthesis and autotrophy, whereas high pCO(2) stimulated photosynthesis. Although survival was unaffected, larvae at 33 ? were ten-times more likely to settle than those at 29 ?, suggesting reduced capacity to disperse and differentiate suitable substrate. Remarkably, heat stress induced greater symbiont loss at am -bient pCO(2) than at high pCO(2), while cell-specific pigment concentrations of symbionts at 33 \& DEG;C increased twofold under ambient pCO2 relative to high pCO(2) suggesting pCO(2)-dependent bleaching patterns. Considerable increases in activities of host antioxidants superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) at 33 ? indicated oxidative stress, whereas lipid peroxidation and caspase activities were contained, thereby restraining larval mortality at 33 ?. Fur -thermore, the coral host mounted stronger transcriptional responses than symbionts. High pCO(2) stimulated host met-abolic pathways, possibly because of the boosted algal productivity. In contrast, host metabolic processes and symbiont photosystem genes were downregulated at 33 ?. Interestingly, the upregulation of extracellular matrix genes and glycosaminoglycan degradation pathway at 33 ? was more evident under ambient pCO(2) than high pCO(2), suggesting compromised host tissue integrity that could have facilitated symbiont expulsion and bleaching. Our results provide insights into how coral larvae respond to warming and acidification at different levels of biological organization, and demonstrate that ocean acidification can mediate thermal bleaching and gene expression in coral larvae under heat stress.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",English,"Huang, H (Corresponding Author), Chinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, Guangzhou 510301, Peoples R China.

However, corals from the northern Red Sea show high thermal tolerance and no recorded massive bleaching event. This specific region is frequently subjected to intense dust storms, coming from the surrounding arid deserts, which are expected to increase in frequency and intensity in the future. The aerial dust deposition supplies essential bioelements to the water column. Here, we investigated the effect of dust deposition on the physiology of a Red Sea coral, Stylophora pistillata. We measured the modifications in coral and Symbiodiniaceae metallome (cellular metal content), as well as the changes in photosynthesis and oxidative stress status of colonies exposed during few weeks to dust deposition. Our results show that 1 mg L-1 of dust supplied nanomolar amounts of nitrate and other essential bioelements, such as iron, manganese, zinc and copper, rapidly assimilated by the symbionts. At 25 degrees C, metal bioaccumulation enhanced the chlorophyll concentration and photosynthesis of dust-exposed corals compared to control corals. These results suggest that primary production was limited by metal availability in seawater. A 5 degrees C increase in seawater temperature enhanced iron assimilation in both control and dust-enriched corals. Temperature rise increased the photosynthesis of control corals only, dust-exposed ones having already reached maximal photosynthesis rates at 25 degrees C. Finally, we observed a combined effect of temperature and bioelement concentration on the assimilation of molybdenum, cadmium, manganese and copper, which were in higher concentrations in symbionts of dust-exposed corals maintained at 30 degrees C. All together these observations highlight the importance of dust deposition in the supply of essential bioelements, such as iron, to corals and its role in sustaining coral productivity in Red Sea reefs.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Blanckaert, ACA (Corresponding Author), Ctr Sci Monaco, Coral Ecophysiol Team, 8 Quai Antoine 1er, MC-98000 Monaco, Monaco.

The interaction between these stressors has been the subject of recent studies on reef organisms such as corals, bryozoa, molluscs, and crustose coralline algae. Here we investigated the combined effects of elevated sea surface temperatures and pCO(2) on two species of photosymbiont-bearing coral reef Foraminifera: Heterostegina depressa (hosting diatoms) and Marginopora vertebralis (hosting dinoflagellates). The effects of single and combined stressors were studied by monitoring survivorship, growth, and physiological parameters, such as respiration, photochemistry (pulse amplitude modulation fluorometry and oxygen production), and chl a content. Specimens were exposed in flow-through aquaria for up to seven weeks to combinations of two pCO(2) (similar to 790 and similar to 490 A mu atm) and two temperature (28 and 31 A degrees C) regimes. Elevated temperature had negative effects on the physiology of both species. Elevated pCO(2) had negative effects on growth and apparent photosynthetic rate in H.depressa but a positive effect on effective quantum yield. With increasing pCO(2), chl a content decreased in H. depressa and increased in M. vertebralis. The strongest stress responses were observed when the two stressors acted in combination. An interaction term was statistically significant in half of the measured parameters. Further exploration revealed that 75 \% of these cases showed a synergistic (= larger than additive) interaction between the two stressors. These results indicate that negative physiological effects on photosymbiont-bearing coral reef Foraminifera are likely to be stronger under simultaneous acidification and temperature rise than what would be expected from the effect of each of the stressors individually.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"Schmidt, C (Corresponding Author), Univ Bremen, MARUM, Leobener Str, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.

To evaluate the effects of predicted elevated seawater temperatures on coral recruitment, larvae from the coral Porites astreoides were exposed to seawater at ambient (27.3 A degrees C) or elevated temperature (30.8 A degrees C) conditions for 4, 24, or 48 h. Following exposure, larvae were tested for survival and settlement, oxidative stress, respiratory demand, and mRNA expression of heat-shock proteins (Hsps) 16 and 60. While elevated temperature had no effect on larval survival, settlement, or expression of Hsps, it did cause a significant increase in larval respiration, oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation), and antioxidant enzyme activity (catalase). The absence of a significant up-regulation of Hsp 16 or 60 expression in response to thermal stress suggests that the transcriptional expression of these genes is a less sensitive diagnostic tool compared to biomarkers of oxidative stress at the temperatures examined. The results of this study provide evidence that enhanced levels of oxidative stress are encountered in zooxanthellae-containing coral larvae in response to elevated temperatures and that this occurrence should be strongly considered for use as a biomarker when monitoring sub-lethal cellular responses to rising sea surface temperatures.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",English,"Ross, C (Corresponding Author), Univ N Florida, Dept Biol, 1 UNF Dr, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA.

Elevated temperature is the main physiological driver of mass coral bleaching events, but increasing evidence suggests that other stressors, including elevated dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), may exacerbate the negative effects of thermal stress. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the performance of larvae of Orbicella faveolata and Porites astreoides, two important Caribbean reef coral species with contrasting reproductive and algal transmission modes, under increased temperature and/or elevated DIN. We used a fluorescence-based microplate respirometer to measure the oxygen consumption of coral larvae from both species, and also assessed the effects of these stressors on P. astreoides larval settlement and mortality. Overall, we found that (1) larvae increased their respiration in response to different factors (O. faveolata in response to elevated temperature and P. astreoides in response to elevated nitrate) and (2) P. astreoides larvae showed a significant increase in settlement as a result of elevated nitrate, but higher mortality under elevated temperature. This study shows how microplate respirometry can be successfully used to assess changes in respiration of coral larvae, and our findings suggest that the effects of thermal stress and nitrate enrichment in coral larvae may be species specific and are neither additive nor synergistic for O. faveolata or P. astreoides. These findings may have important consequences for the recruitment and community reassembly of corals to nutrient-polluted reefs that have been impacted by climate change.",SPRINGER,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",English,"Serrano, XM (Corresponding Author), Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine \& Atmospher Studies, Rosenstiel Sch Marine \& Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.

Within species, differences in thermal tolerance have been found among populations from different habitats, but it is not clear whether such differences occur among LBFs inhabiting similar habitats, but differing in other aspects, such as symbiont type. To this end, we compared responses to thermal stress in specimens from a population of Amphistegina lessonii, an abundant Indo-Pacific species, to specimens of Amphistegina gibbosa, its Atlantic counter-part, from a similar environment but two different water depths (5 and 18 m). Test groups of each species were exposed in a common experiment to three thermal stress scenarios over a four-week period. Growth, respiration, mortality and motility were measured to characterize the holobiont response. Coloration, photosynthesis and chlorophyll a content were measured to determine the response of the endosymbiotic diatoms. The photosymbionts were characterized by genetic fingerprinting. Our results show that, although groups of A. gibbosa were collected from different habitats, their responses were similar, indicating only marginally higher tolerance to thermal peaks in specimens from the shallower site. In contrast, species-specific differences were stronger, with A. lessonii showing higher tolerance to episodic stress and less pronounced impacts of chronic stress on motility, growth and photosymbiont performance. These interspecies variations are consistent with the presence of different and more diverse symbiont assemblages in A. lessonii compared with A. gibbosa. This study demonstrates the importance of considering symbiont diversity in the assessment of infra- and interspecific variations in stress responses in LBFs.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"Stuhr, M (Corresponding Author), Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res ZMT, Biogeochem \& Geol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.

However, how such photosynthetic efficiency varies with environmental stress remains poorly known. Using fiber-optic and electrochemical microsensors in combination with variable chlorophyll fluorescence imaging, we investigated the combined effects of thermal stress and active feeding on the radiative energy budget and photosynthetic efficiency of the symbiotic coral Pocillopora sp. At ambient temperature (25 degrees C), the percentage of absorbed light energy used for photosynthesis under low irradiance was higher for fed (similar to 5-6\%) compared to unfed corals (4\%). Corals from both feeding treatments responded equally to stress from high light exposure (2400 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)), exhibiting a decrease in photosynthetic efficiency, down to 0.5-0.6\%. Fed corals showed increased resilience to thermal-induced bleaching (loss of symbionts) compared to unfed corals. In addition, while unfed corals decreased their photosynthetic efficiency almost immediately when exposed to thermal stress, fed corals maintained a constant and high photosynthetic efficiency for 5 more days after onset of thermal stress.

The objective of this study was to investigate how two coral species, Porites lutea and Galaxea fascicularis, from two high latitude reefs differently exposed to chronic disturbance, respond to elevated seawater temperatures. Corals were collected from reefs nearshore (i.e. subjected to high sediment load, higher chlorophyll a concentrations, turbidity etc.) and offshore (i.e. less exposed). The corals were exposed in the lab to gradually increasing temperatures (25.5-33.5 degrees C) for 72 h after which they were allowed to recover to ambient temperature (25.5 degrees C) for 24 h. Production and respiration were measured after 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. The results show that P. lutea from nearshore reefs suffered an initial decrease in gross primary production/respiration (GP/R) ratio after 24 h, after only a moderate temperature increase (+2 degrees C, from 25.5 to 27.5 degrees C), while there was no difference in GP/R ratio between heat-exposed and controls the other days, indicating that the chronic disturbance in the nearshore reef had no effect on their thermotolerance. Furthermore, P. lutea from the offshore reef showed a decrease in GP/R ratio both after 24 h and 72 h (33.5 degrees C) of exposure. In comparison, G. fascicularis showed a decrease in GP/R ratio after 48 h, 72 h and 96 h of exposure for the nearshore corals. Also, after 72 h these corals had withdrawn their polyps. There were no differences between heat-treated and controls for the offshore G. fascicularis. This implies that the chronically disturbed G. fascicularis had lower thermotolerance when exposed to a temperature increase. This study, hence, shows that the response of corals to elevated seawater temperature varies with species and environmental background history. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, acidification is likely to affect the relationship between corals and their symbiotic dinoflagellates and the productivity of this association. However, little is known about how acidification impacts on the physiology of reef builders and how acidification interacts with warming. Here, we report on an 8-week study that compared bleaching, productivity, and calcification responses of crustose coralline algae (CCA) and branching (Acropora) and massive (Porites) coral species in response to acidification and warming. Using a 30-tank experimental system, we manipulated CO2 levels to simulate doubling and three- to fourfold increases {[}intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projection categories IV and VI] relative to present-day levels under cool and warm scenarios. Results indicated that high CO2 is a bleaching agent for corals and CCA under high irradiance, acting synergistically with warming to lower thermal bleaching thresholds. We propose that CO2. induces bleaching via its impact on photoprotective mechanisms of the photosystems. Overall, acidification impacted more strongly on bleaching and productivity than on calcification. Interestingly, the intermediate, warm CO2 scenario led to a 30\% increase in productivity in Acropora, whereas high CO2 lead to zero productivity in both corals. CCA were most sensitive to acidification, with high CO2 leading to negative productivity and high rates of net dissolution. Our findings suggest that sensitive reef-building species such as CCA may be pushed beyond their thresholds for growth and survival within the next few decades whereas corals will show delayed and mixed responses.",NATL ACAD SCIENCES,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",English,"Anthony, KRN (Corresponding Author), Univ Queensland, Ctr Marine Studies, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.

In reef-building corals, the engineers of these ecosystems, this nutrient recycling is facilitated by a constant exchange of nutrients between the animal host and endosymbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae), bacteria, and other microbes. Due to the complex interactions in this so-called coral holobiont, it has proven difficult to understand the environmental limitations of productivity in corals. Among others, the micronutrient iron has been proposed to limit primary productivity due to its essential role in photosynthesis and bacterial processes. Here, we tested the effect of iron enrichment on the physiology of the coral Pocillopora verrucosa from the central Red Sea during a 12-day experiment. Contrary to previous reports, we did not see an increase in zooxanthellae population density or gross photosynthesis. Conversely, respiration rates were significantly increased, and microbial nitrogen fixation was significantly decreased. Taken together, our data suggest that iron is not a limiting factor of primary productivity in Red Sea corals. Rather, increased metabolic demands in response to iron enrichment, as evidenced by increased respiration rates, may reduce carbon (i.e., energy) availability in the coral holobiont, resulting in reduced microbial nitrogen fixation. This decrease in nitrogen supply in turn may exacerbate the limitation of other nutrients, creating a negative feedback loop. Thereby, our results highlight that the effects of iron enrichment appear to be strongly dependent on local environmental conditions and ultimately may depend on the availability of other nutrients.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Voolstra, CR (Corresponding Author), KAUST, Div Biol \& Environm Sci \& Engn BESE, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.

The P-g:R ratio was always higher at the control salinity. Most of the colonies maintained at 40 psu died, and this was explained by a very low P-g:R ratio (<1).

Rising seawater temperatures destabilize this relationship, resulting in drastic declines in world-wide coral cover. Thermal history is thought to play an important role in shaping a coral's response to subsequent thermal stress. Here, we exposed Pocillopora damicomis to two thermal acclimation regimes (ambient vs. warm) and compared the effect that acclimation had on the coral holobiont's response to a subsequent seven day heat stress event. We conducted daily physiological measurements at the holobiont level (gross photosynthesis, respiration, host protein content, symbiont density and chlorophyll content) throughout the heating event, as well as cellular-level imaging of C-13-bicarbonate and N-15-nitrate assimilation (using NanoSIMS) at the end of the heat stress event. Thermal acclimation history had a negligible effect on the measurements conducted at the holobiont level during the heat stress event. No differences were observed in the O-2-budget between ambient and warm-acclimated corals and only small fluctuations in host protein, symbiont density and chlorophyll content were detected. In contrast, this lack of differential response, was not mirrored at the cellular level. Warm-acclimated corals had substantially higher C-13 enrichment in the host gastrodermis and lipid bodies, but significantly lower N-15-nitrate assimilation in the symbionts and the host tissue layers, relative to the ambient-acclimated corals. We discuss potential reasons for the disconnect that occurred between symbiont bicarbonate and nitrate assimilation (in the absence of photosynthetic breakdown) in the warm-acclimated corals. We suggest this represents either a shift in nitrogen utilization, or supply limitation by the host. Our findings raise several interesting hypotheses regarding the role that nitrogen metabolism plays in thermal stress, which will warrant further investigation if we are to understand the acclimatization capacity of the coral holobiont.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",English,"Gibbin, EM; Meibom, A (Corresponding Author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil \& Environm Engn, Lab Biol Geochem, Lausanne, Switzerland.

There is increasing evidence of functional significance to Symbiodinium diversity, which affects the coral holobiont's response to changing environmental conditions. For example, corals hosting Symbiodinium from the clade D taxon exhibit greater resistance to heat-induced coral bleaching than conspecifics hosting the more common clade C. Yet, the relatively low prevalence of clade D suggests that this trait is not advantageous in non-stressful environments. Thus, clade D may only be able to out-compete other Symbiodinium types within the host habitat when conditions are chronically stressful. Previous studies have observed enhanced photosynthesis and fitness by clade C holobionts at non-stressful temperatures, relative to clade D. Yet, carbon-centered metrics cannot account for enhanced growth rates and patterns of symbiont succession to other genetic types when nitrogen often limits reef productivity. To investigate the metabolic costs of hosting thermally tolerant symbionts, we examined the assimilation and translocation of inorganic N-15 and C-13 in the coral Acropora tenuis experimentally infected with either clade C (sub-type C1) or D Symbiodinium at 28 and 30 degrees C. We show that at 28 degrees C, C1 holobionts acquired 22\% more N-15 than clade D. However, at 30 degrees C, C1 symbionts acquired equivalent nitrogen and 16\% less carbon than D. We hypothesize that C1 competitively excludes clade D in hospite via enhanced nitrogen acquisition and thus dominates coral populations despite warming oceans.",NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",English,"Baker, DM (Corresponding Author), Carnegie Inst Sci, Geophys Lab, 5251 Broad Branch Rd NW, Washington, DC 20015 USA.

When the temperature exceeds the tolerant limit of a coral-zooxanthellae holobiont, it induces physiological stress and disrupts the vulnerable fine-tuned balance between the two partners, leading to bleaching. The gene expression profiles of a scleractinian coral and its symbiotic zooxanthellae can offer important information with which to decipher this balanced relationship at the functional level of genes. Here, we sequence a full-length transcriptome of a well-known, common and frequently dominant reef-building coral, Pocillopora damicornis, to acquire gene expression information for the coral-zooxanthellae holobiont. To this end, we identify 21,926 and 465 unique genes in the coral and algal symbiont, respectively, and examine the functional enrichment among these genes based on GO (gene ontology) terms and KEGG (the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways. The results show that the zooxanthellae provide for their coral host through energy and nutrition metabolism by photosynthesis, and that both the coral host and zooxanthellae have an anti-stress molecular mechanism, though the two parties have independent abilities to survive in the short term. This work sheds light on the valuable gene expression profile of a coral-zooxanthellae holobiont and provides grounds for further molecular biological research to support ecological protection work.",MDPI,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",English,"He, CP; Lu, ZH (Corresponding Author), Southeast Univ, Sch Biol Sci \& Med Engn, State Key Lab Bioelect, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China.

K. and Dove, S.",The effect of temperature stress on coral-Symbiodinium associations containing distinct symbiont types,CORAL REEFS,2012,31,2,473-485,JUN,"Several studies have demonstrated that the temperature tolerance of scleractinian reef-building corals is controlled, in part, by hosting physiologically distinct symbiotic algae. We investigated the thermal tolerance of coral-algal associations within seven common species of reef-building corals hosting distinct Symbiodinium sub-clades collected from Heron Island during experimentally induced bleaching conditions. During experimental heating, photosynthetic fitness was assessed by the dark-adapted yield of PSII (F (v)/F (m)), and excitation pressure across PSII (Q (m)) of each coral-algal association using pulse amplitude modulation fluorometry. The onset of bleaching was determined by the measurement of Symbiodinium cell density. Using the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS-2) region, we showed that Symbiodinium type-coral host associations were temporally and spatially conserved in a high proportion of the colonies sampled within each species. Generally, the species Acropora millepora, Platygyra daedalea, Acropora aspera and Acropora formosa contained Symbiodinium ITS-2 type C3, whereas the species Montipora digitata, Porites cylindrica and Porites lutea contained Symbiodinium type C15. Bleaching susceptibility showed some association with Symbiodinium type, but further research is required to confirm this. Corals hosting C3 Symbiodinium displayed higher reductions in F (v)/F (m) during heating compared to their C15 counterparts, irrespective of host species. However, a corresponding reduction in Symbiodinium density was not observed. Nonetheless, A. aspera and A. formosa showed significant reductions in Symbiodinium density relative to controls. This correlated with large increases in Q (m) and decreases in F (v)/F (m) in heated explants. Our results suggest a range of bleaching susceptibilities for the coral species investigated, with A. aspera and A. formosa showing the greatest susceptibility to bleaching and M. digitata showing the lowest bleaching susceptibility. The data provide strong evidence for distinct differences in temperature tolerance between C3 and C15 Symbiodinium types when in-hospite; however, future studies addressing the confounding effect of host species would help to confirm this.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"Fisher, PL (Corresponding Author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.

The present study compares profiles of the bacterial communities associated with juvenile corals of Acropora millepora and A. tenuis that had been experimentally infected with 2 different clades of Symbiodinium, Clade C1 and D, to investigate possible interactions between bacterial and Symbiodinium communities. Three culture-independent 16S rRNA gene profiling methods (clone library construction, terminal restriction length polymorphism and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) revealed no discernible pattern in bacterial communities on 9 mo old juvenile corals containing different clades of zooxanthellae, suggesting that coral-associated bacteria are not linked to Symbiodinium types in hospite in early ontogeny. In contrast to bacterial profiles of adult corals, bacterial communities associated with juvenile corals were highly variable, indicating that bacterial associates are not conserved in these early stages. When 12 mo old juveniles were sampled again in summer, bacteria I communities associated with A. tenuis hosting Clade D Symbiodinium were dominated by sequences affiliating with Vibrio species, indicating that corals harbouring this symbiont may be more susceptible to temperature stress, allowing growth of opportunistic microbial community members possibly detrimental to coral health.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",English,"Bourne, DG (Corresponding Author), Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia.

On coral reefs, measures of metabolism have been used to quantify symbiosis functioning between corals and their obligate algal symbionts (Symbiodiniaceae), as well as assess how environmental stressors, including climate change, will impact coral health. Despite this significance, there is a lack of methods, and therefore data, relating to metabolic rate measurements in coral offspring, likely due to their small size. To address this gap, this study aimed to develop a custom setup for measuring the respiration of small (millimeter size range) marine animal ecologies.

Global climate change could lead to increased variability of sea surface temperatures, through influences on climate systems, e.g. El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Field observations in 1999, following a strong ENSO, revealed that corals bleached in winter after unusually cold weather. To explore the basis for these observations, the photosynthetic responses of the coral species Montipora digitata Studer were investigated in a series of temperature and light experiments. Small replicate coral colonies were exposed to ecologically relevant lower temperatures for varying durations and under light regimes that ranged from darkness to full sunlight. Photosynthetic efficiency was analyzed using a pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometer (F-0, F-m, F-v/F-m), and chlorophyll a (chl a) content and symbiotic dinoflagellate density were analyzed with spectrophotometry and microscopy, respectively. Cold temperature stress had a negative impact on M digitata colonies indicated by decreased photosynthetic efficiency (F-v/F-m), loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates and changes in photosynthetic pigment concentrations. Corals in higher light regimes were more susceptible to cold temperature stress, Moderate cold stress resulted in photoacclimatory responses, but severe cold stress resulted in photodamage, bleaching and increased mortality. Responses to cold temperature stress of M digitata appeared similar to that observed in corals exposed to warmer than normal temperatures, suggesting a common mechanism. The results of this study suggest that corals and coral reefs may also be impacted by exposure to cold as well as warm temperature extremes as climate change occurs.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",English,"Saxby, T (Corresponding Author), Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, POB 775, Cambridge, MD 21613 USA.

The complex, linked physiological processes that enable the holobiont (coral + algae) to calcify and generate reef structures are consequently of great interest. However, the mechanism of calcification is difficult to study for several reasons including the small spatial scales of the processes and the close coupling between the symbiont and host. In this study, we explore the utility of pH and Ca2+ microelectrodes for constraining the rates and spatial distribution of photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification. The work focuses on vertical profiles of pH and Ca2+ through the coelenteron cavity, a semi-isolated compartment of modified seawater amenable to quantitative interpretation. In two studied species, Turbincuia reniformis and Acropora nallepora, Ca2+ concentrations decreased in a roughly linear manner from the mouth to the base of the coelenteron, indicating the primary physiological process affecting Ca2+ concentration is removal for calcification below the coelenteron. In contrast, the H+ concentration remained relatively constant over much of the coelenteron cavity before it increased sharply toward the base of the coelenteron, indicative of proton-pumping from the calcification fluid below. The estimated H+ gradient between the coelenteron cavity and the calcification site was > 10 times higher than previously predicted. Consequently, the energy required to export protons from the calcifying fluid was estimated to be similar to 3 times higher than previously calculated. A one-dimensional reaction-diffusion model was used to interpret the pH profile considering the effects of photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification. This model provided a good fit to the observed pH profile and helped to constrain the rates and spatial distribution of these processes. Our modeling results also suggested that adult corals with deeper polyps may be more sensitive to ocean acidification (OA) because of enhanced difficulty to transport H+ out of the coelenteron and into the surrounding seawater.",ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",English,"Cai, WJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci \& Policy, Newark, DE 19716 USA.

For instance, high temperature-induced bleaching has been occurring annually since 2014 in New Caledonia. Because most corals cannot withstand repeated years when bleaching occurs, an analysis was undertaken to showcase coral behavior in a period just before the onset of ``annual severe bleaching{''} (ASB; November 2013) such that future generations might know how these corals functioned in their last bleaching-free year. Pocillopora damicornis colonies were sampled across a variety of environmental gradients, and a subset was sampled during both day and night to understand how their molecular biology changes upon cessation of dinoflagellate photosynthesis. Of the 13 environmental parameters tested, sampling time (i.e., light) most significantly affected coral molecular physiology, and expression levels of a number of both host and Symbiodiniaceae genes demonstrated significant diel variation; endosymbiont mRNA expression was more temporally variable than that of their anthozoan hosts. Furthermore, expression of all stress-targeted genes in both eukaryotic compartments of the holobiont was high, even in isolated, uninhabited, federally protected atolls of the country's far northwest. Whether this degree of sub-cellular stress reflects cumulative climate change impacts or, instead, a stress-hardened phenotype, will be unveiled through assessing the fates of these corals in the wake of increasingly frequent marine heatwaves.",MDPI,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",English,"Mayfield, AB (Corresponding Author), Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine \& Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33149 USA.

Biological regulation of calcification fluid pH (pH(CF)) and other carbonate chemistry parameters ({[}CO32-](CF), DICCF, and Omega(CF)) may be challenged by CO2 driven acidification and temperature. Here, we examine the combined influence of changing temperature and CO2 on calcifying fluid regulation in four common Caribbean coral species-Porites astreoides, Pseudodiploria strigosa, Undaria tenuifolia, and Siderastrea siderea. We utilize skeletal boron geochemistry (B/Ca and delta B-11) to probe the pH(CF), {[}CO32-](CF), and DICCF regulation in these corals, and delta C-13 to track changes in the sources of carbon for calcification. Temperature was found to not influence pH(CF) regulation across all pCO(2) treatments in these corals, in contrast to recent studies on Indo-Pacific pocilloporid corals. We find that {[}DIC](CF) is significantly lower at higher temperatures in all the corals, and that the higher temperature was associated with depletion of host energy reserves, suggesting [}DIC](CF) reductions may result from reduced input of respired CO2 to the DIC pool for calcification. In addition, delta C-13 data suggest that under high temperature and CO2 conditions, algal symbiont photosynthesis continues to influence the calcification pool and is associated with low {[}DIC](CF) in P. strigosa and P. astreoides. In P. astreoides this effect is also associated with an increase in chlorophyll a concentration in coral tissues at higher temperatures. These observations collectively support the assertion that physicochemical control over coral calcifying fluid chemistry is coupled to host and symbiont physiological responses to environmental change, and reveals interspecific differences in the extent and nature of this coupling.",MDPI,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",English,"Eagle, RA (Corresponding Author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Ctr Diverse Leadership Sci, Inst Environm \& Sustainabil, Dept Atmospher \& Ocean Sci, 520 Portola Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.

Fragments of the reef flat coral, Acropora millepora, exposed to the two heating events lost 78\% of their symbionts and showed a 64\% decline in dark adapted quantum yield (Fv/Fm) to values less than 0.25. Whereas corals that were only heated in the second event lost 57\% symbionts and displayed a 75\% decline in Fv/Fm to values less than 0.2. Coral in both pre-stressed and non pre-stressed treatments at 34 degrees C had net photosynthetic rates significantly less than zero (P-net max<0), suggesting that daytime O-2 respiration rates were significantly greater than rates of O-2 evolution through photosynthesis. Increases in the daily light field and/or increases in temperature led to the observation of dark-adapted xanthophyll de-epoxidation suggesting that the potential for non-photochemical quenching is maintained into the dark (after 1 h dark adaption). Pre-stressed corals were also found to have de-epoxidation ratios three times greater than non pre-stressed corals at 34 degrees C and xanthophyll pool to Chl a, much greater than non pre-stressed corals. Combined, these results indicate that symbionts in pre-stressed corals have a greater ability to dump incoming light energy as heat We conclude that whilst differences were observed between pre-stressed and non pre-stressed populations in measurements of photosynthetic productivity, photosynthetic pigments and areal protein, thermal bleaching as defined by symbiont loss did not vary between treatments.

Algae were not expelled and there was no decrease in photosynthesis or chlorophyll a. Chlorophyll c decreased in only one out of four experiments. Total carotenoids increased in all the experiments. Two host signalling compounds that regulate algal carbon metabolism, host release factor (HRF) which stimulates algal photosynthate release, and photosynthesis inhibiting factor (PIF) which partially inhibits photosynthetic carbon fixation, were examined. PIF activity was slightly higher after 16 and 36 d of exposure to copper, but HRF activity was always similar to seawater control corals. Algae isolated from corals previously exposed to copper showed a variable response. In one experiment (12 d exposure), algae were not inhibited by PIF and stimulation by HRF was lower than in algae isolated from seawater control corals. In another experiment (36 d exposure), algae still responded to HRF but were less responsive to PIF In parallel with the length of exposure to copper, oxidative damage was evident in coral tissues, as a decrease in the levels of tryptophan (up to 34\%) and coral fluorophores (16-88\%). This study shows that changes in fluorescent compounds can give an early indication of copper-induced damage in this coral before damage is outwardly visible. This is the first study to show that copper may alter algal responses to two host signalling compounds that regulate symbiotic algae. (C) 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

Anthropogenic activities have resulted in increased atmospheric CO2 levels and a subsequent rise in ocean temperatures. In addition to increasing water temperature, elevated CO2 levels are leading to a decrease in oceanic pH (ocean acidification). These two changes have the potential to alter ecological processes within the oceans, including the outcome of competitive coral-macroalgal interactions. In our study, we explored the combined effect of temperature increase and ocean acidification on the competition between the coral Porites lobata and on the Great Barrier Reef abundant macroalga Chlorodesmis fastigiata. A temperature increase of +1 degrees C above present temperatures and CO2 increase of +85 ppm were used to simulate a low end emission scenario for the mid- to late 21st century, according to the Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6 (RCP2.6). Our results revealed that the net photosynthesis of P. lobata decreased when it was in contact with C. fastigiata under ambient conditions, and that dark respiration increased under RCP2.6 conditions. The Photosynthesis to Respiration (P:R) ratios of corals as they interacted with macroalgal competitors were not significantly different between scenarios. Dark calcification rates of corals under RCP2.6 conditions, however, were negative and significantly decreased compared to ambient conditions. Light calcification rates were negatively affected by the interaction of macroalgal contact in the RCP2.6 scenario, compared to algal mimics and to coral under ambient conditions. Chlorophyll a, and protein content increased in the RCP2.6 scenario, but were not influenced by contact with the macroalga. We conclude that the coral host was negatively affected by RCP2.6 conditions, whereas the productivity of its symbionts (zooxanthellae) was enhanced. While a negative effect of the macroalga (C. fastigiata) on the coral (P. lobata) was observed for the P:R ratio under control conditions, it was not enhanced under RCP2.6 conditions.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",English,"RÃ¶lfer, L (Corresponding Author), Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res ZMT, Fahrenheitstr 6, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.

There is a consequent need to characterize the responses of corals to thermal stress to understand the molecular processes underpinning these responses and identify hallmarks of resilience. Here we used an iTRAQ approach to compare the proteomes of adult corals (Pocillopora acuta) that had been thermally conditioned at a control (26 degrees C) or elevated temperature (29.5 degrees C) for three reproductive cycles, as well as the larvae released by these corals. We found that larvae responded more to high-temperature exposure at the protein level than their parents and that different proteins were affected between life stages; a single protein was up-regulated at high temperatures in both adults and their offspring, and its identity is currently unknown. Similarly, different cellular pathways were affected by high-temperature exposure between the coral hosts and their dinoflagellate endosymbionts; proteins involved in translation and protein trafficking were most likely to be affected by high-temperature exposure in the former, with photosynthesis being the most thermo-sensitive process in the latter. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of considering both life stage and the composition of the coral holobiont when using molecular-scale data to model cellular processes associated with responses to future ocean warming.</p>",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",English,"McRae, CJ (Corresponding Author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC, Canada.

Coral microbiome plays a key role in host acclimatization and maintenance of the coral holobiont's homeostasis under different environmental conditions, however, the response patterns of coral prokaryotic symbionts to ocean acidification and/or warming are rarely known at the metatranscriptional level, particularly the knowledge of interactive and persistent effects is limited. Using branching Acropora valida and massive Galaxea fascicularis as models in a lab system simulating extreme ocean acidification (pH 7.7) and/or warming (32 degrees C) in the future, we investigated the changes of in situ active prokaryotic symbionts community and gene expression of corals under/after (6/9 d) acidification (A), warming (H) and acidification-warming (AH) by metatranscriptome analysis with pH8.1, 26 degrees C as the control.ResultsA, H and AH increased the relative abundance of in situ active pathogenic bacteria. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in virulence, stress resistance, and heat shock proteins were up-regulated. Many DEGs involved in photosynthesis, carbon dioxide fixation, amino acids, cofactors and vitamins, auxin synthesis were down-regulated. A broad array of new DEGs involved in carbohydrate metabolism and energy production emerged after the stress treatment. Different response patterns of prokaryotic symbionts of massive G. fascicularis and branching A. valida were suggested, as well as the interactive effects of combined AH and persistent effects.ConclusionsThe metatranscriptome-based study indicates that acidification and/or warming might change coral's in situ active prokaryotic microbial diversity and functional gene expression towards more pathogenic and destabilized coral-microbes symbioses, particularly combined acidification and warming show interactive effects.

Incubating corals for 3 h in a cyanide concentration of >10(-5) M NaCN under a saturating light intensity (photosynthetically active radiation {[}PAR] intensity of 250 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)) caused a long-term decrease in the ratio of variable to maximal fluorescence (dark-adapted F-v/F-m). The effect of cyanide on dark-adapted F-v/F-m was Light dependent; thus F-v/F-m only decreased in corals exposed to 10(-4) M NaCN for 3 h under PAR of 250 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1). In corals where dark-adapted F-v/F-m was significantly lowered by cyanide exposure, we observed significant loss of zooxanthellae from the tissues. causing the corals to discolour (bleach). To further examine the light-dependent effect of cyanide and its relation to loss of zooxanthellae, corals were exposed to 10-4 M NaCN or seawater only (control), either in darkness or under 250 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1). ill significant decrease in dark-adapted F-v/F-m and loss of zooxanthellae only occurred in corals exposed to cyanide in the light. These results suggest cyanide causes the dissociation of the symbiosis (bleaching) by affecting photosynthesis of the zooxanthellae. Quenching analysis using the saturation-pulse technique revealed the development of high levels of non-photochemical quenching in cyanide-exposed coral. This result is consistent with the known property of cyanide as an inhibitor of the dark reactions of the Calvin cycle, specifically as an inhibitor of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). Therefore, chronic photoinhibition and an impairment of photosynthesis of zooxanthellae provides an important `signal' to examine the environmental effects of cyanide fishing during controlled releases in situ.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",English,"Jones, RJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.

Y. and Fogel, Marilyn L. and Knowlton, Nancy",Climate change promotes parasitism in a coral symbiosis,ISME JOURNAL,2018,12,3,921-930,MAR,"Coastal oceans are increasingly eutrophic, warm and acidic through the addition of anthropogenic nitrogen and carbon, respectively. Among the most sensitive taxa to these changes are scleractinian corals, which engineer the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth. Corals' sensitivity is a consequence of their evolutionary investment in symbiosis with the dinoflagellate alga, Symbiodinium. Together, the coral holobiont has dominated oligotrophic tropical marine habitats. However, warming destabilizes this association and reduces coral fitness. It has been theorized that, when reefs become warm and eutrophic, mutualistic Symbiodinium sequester more resources for their own growth, thus parasitizing their hosts of nutrition. Here, we tested the hypothesis that sub- bleaching temperature and excess nitrogen promotes symbiont parasitism by measuring respiration (costs) and the assimilation and translocation of both carbon (energy) and nitrogen (growth; both benefits) within Orbicella faveolata hosting one of two Symbiodinium phylotypes using a dual stable isotope tracer incubation at ambient (26 degrees C) and sub- bleaching (31 degrees C) temperatures under elevated nitrate. Warming to 31 degrees C reduced holobiont net primary productivity (NPP) by 60\% due to increased respiration which decreased host \% carbon by 15\% with no apparent cost to the symbiont. Concurrently, Symbiodinium carbon and nitrogen assimilation increased by 14 and 32\%, respectively while increasing their mitotic index by 15\%, whereas hosts did not gain a proportional increase in translocated photosynthates. We conclude that the disparity in benefits and costs to both partners is evidence of symbiont parasitism in the coral symbiosis and has major implications for the resilience of coral reefs under threat of global change.",NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",English,"Baker, DM (Corresponding Author), Univ Hong Kong, Swire Inst Marine Sci, Sch Biol Sci, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

Previously, detrimental effects of natural and anthropogenic stressors on coral health could not be ascertained until significant physiological responses resulted in visible signs of stress (e.g. tissue necrosis, bleaching). In this study, a focused. anthozoan holobiont microarray was used to detect early and sub-lethal effects of spatial and temporal environmental changes on gene expression patterns in the scleractinian coral, Montastraea cavernosa, on south Florida reefs. Although all colonies appeared healthy (i.e. no visible tissue necrosis or bleaching), corals were differentially physiologically compensating for exposure to stressors that varied over time. Corals near the Port of Miami inlet experienced significant changes in expression of stress responsive and symbiont (zooxanthella)-specific genes after periods of heavy precipitation. In contrast, coral populations did not demonstrate stress responses during periods of increased water temperature (up to 29 degrees C). Specific acute and long-term localized responses to other stressors were also evident. A correlation between stress response genes and symbiont-specific genes was also observed, possibly indicating early processes involved in the maintenance or disruption of the coral zooxanthella symbiosis. This is the first study to reveal spatially- and temporally-related variation in gene expression in response to different stressors of in situ coral populations, and demonstrates that microarray technology can be used to detect specific sub-lethal physiological responses to specific environmental conditions that are not visually detectable.

AOX competes for electrons with the conventional COX and has been hypothesized to function as a means of reducing oxidative stress in mitochondria, as well as a potential mechanism for ameliorating thermal and other physiological stressors. Here, the presence of an active AOX in cultured Symbiodinium was assayed by the response of oxygen consumption to the AOX inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) and the COX inhibitor cyanide (CN). CN-insensitive, SHAM-sensitive oxygen consumption was found to account for a large portion (26 \%) of Symbiodinium dark respiration and is consistent with high levels of AOX activity. This experimental evidence of the existence of a previously unreported terminal oxidase was further corroborated by analysis of publicly available Symbiodinium transcriptome data. The potential for enhanced AOX expression to play a compensatory role in mediating thermal stress was supported by inhibitor assays of cultured Symbiodinium at low (18 A degrees C), moderate (26 A degrees C), and high (32 A degrees C) temperature conditions. Maximum capacity of the putative AOX pathway as a proportion of total dark oxygen consumption was found to increase from 26 \% at 26 A degrees C to 45 \% and 53 \% at 18 A degrees C and 32 A degrees C, respectively, when cells were acclimated to the treatment temperatures. Cells assayed at 18 and 32 A degrees C without acclimation exhibited either the same or lower AOX capacity as controls, suggesting that the AOX protein is upregulated under temperature stress.

Several controversial hypotheses have been proposed as possible mechanisms for connecting symbiont photosynthesis and coral calcification, including pH rise in the internal pool, role of organic matrix secretion, and enzyme activities. Here, based on the skeletal chemical and isotopic compositions of symbiotic and asymbiotic primary polyps of Acropora digitifera corals, we show a simple pH increase in the calcification medium as the predominant contribution of symbionts to calcification of host corals. We used the symbiotic and asymbiotic primary polyps reared for 10 days at four temperatures (27, 29, 31, and 33 degrees C), five salinities (34, 32, 30, 28, and 26), and four pCO(2) levels (<300, 400, 800, and 1000)(atm). As a result of analyzing multiple geochemical tracers (U/Ca, Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, delta O-18, delta C-13, and 8 44 Ca), a clear and systematic decrease in skeletal U/Ca ratio (used as a proxy for calcification fluid pH) was observed, indicating a higher pH of the fluid in symbiotic compared to asymbiotic polyps. In contrast, Mg/Ca ratios (used as a tentative proxy for organic matrix secretion) and 8 44 Ca (used as an indicator of Ca2+ pathway to the fluid) did not differ between symbiotic and asymbiotic polyps. This suggests that organic matrix secretion related to coral calcification is controlled mainly by the coral host itself, and a transmembrane transport of Ca2+ does not vary according to symbiosis relationship. Skeletal delta O-18 values of both symbiotic and asymbiotic polyps showed offsets between them with identical temperature dependence. Based on a newly proposed model, behavior of delta O-18 in the present study seems to reflect the rate of CO2 hydration in the calcifying fluid. Since CO2 hydration is promoted by enzyme carbonic anhydrase, the offset of delta O-18 values between symbiotic and asymbiotic polyps is attributed to the differences of enzyme activity, although the enzyme is functional even in the asymbiotic polyp. Symbiotic delta C-13 values in the temperature and salinity experiments were higher compared to those in the asymbiotic polyps due to photosynthesis, although photosynthetic delta C-13 signals in the pCO(2) experiment were masked by the dominant delta C-13 gradient in dissolved inorganic carbon in seawater caused by C-13-depletd CO2 gas addition in the higher pCO(2) treatments. Sr/Ca ratios showed a negligible relationship according to variation of temperature, salinity, and pCO(2), although it might be attributed to relatively large deviations of replicates of Sr/Ca ratios in the present study. Overall, only the U/Ca ratio showed a significant difference between symbiotic and asymbiotic polyps throughout all experiments, indicating that the critical effect on coral calcification caused by symbiotic algae is the increase of pH of the calcifying fluid by photosynthesis.

The coral fragments were first cultured in either low-nutrient (LN) or high-nutrient (HN) seawater condition at 27 degrees C for 25 days and the seawater temperature was then elevated and kept at 31 degrees C for 1 week for both nutrient conditions. Nutrient enrichment at 27 degrees C increased the densities of symbiotic algae and chlorophyll a and the algal release rates (AR) from the host coral to the ambient seawater. The percentage of algal release rate to the standing stock (AR\%) was approximately 0.015\%h(-1) for both nutrient conditions at 27 degrees C. After the seawater temperature was elevated to 31 degrees C, the densities of zooxanthellae in the corals decreased by 21-61\%, and AR and AR\% increased. The corals in HN lost more zooxanthellae per unit surface area than those in LN, but the lost percentages were not significantly different between LN and HN. AR\% was also not significantly different between LN and HN at 31 degrees C. These results indicated that the percentage rate of symbiotic algal loss was not affected by the nutrient condition, implying that nutrient incorporation itself would not accelerate coral bleaching susceptibility.

Therefore, a better understanding of the ecological ramifications of warming and land-based inputs (e.g. sedimentation and nutrient loading) on coral reef ecosystems is necessary. In this study, we measured how a natural nutrient and sedimentation gradient affected multiple facets of coral functionality, including endosymbiont and coral host response variables, holobiont metabolic responses and percent cover of Pocillopora acuta colonies in Mo'orea, French Polynesia. We used thermal performance curves to quantify the relationship between metabolic rates and temperature along the environmental gradient. We found that algal endosymbiont percent nitrogen content, endosymbiont densities and total chlorophyll a content increased with nutrient input, while endosymbiont nitrogen content per cell decreased, likely representing competition among the algal endosymbionts. Nutrient and sediment loading decreased coral metabolic responses to thermal stress in terms of their thermal performance and metabolic rate processes. The acute thermal optimum for dark respiration decreased, along with the maximal performance for gross photosynthetic and calcification rates. Gross photosynthetic and calcification rates normalized to a reference temperature (26.8 degrees C) decreased along the gradient. Lastly, percent cover of P. acuta colonies decreased by nearly two orders of magnitude along the nutrient gradient. These findings illustrate that nutrient and sediment loading affect multiple levels of coral functionality. Understanding how local-scale anthropogenic stressors influence the responses of corals to temperature can inform coral reef management, particularly in relation to the mediation of land-based inputs into coastal coral reef ecosystems.",COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",English,"Becker, DM; Silbiger, NJ (Corresponding Author), Calif State Univ, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA.

Coral tissues were dissociated by Ca2+-Mg2+-free artificial seawater. Cell suspensions were divided into the major cellular compartments (animal cells, algal cells, holobiont entities) by sucrose gradient and then by detergent treatments. Cell fractions were irradiated by UVB lamp (4.05, 8.1 and 12.2 kJ m(-2)) and subjected to the comet assay. UVB radiation, at levels that induced a moderate DNA breakage to the non-symbiotic coral and algal cell compartments, caused dramatic increase in DNA breakage to the holobiont entities. After a 1 h repair period, DNA breakage levels in the algal and animal cell fractions were augmented as compared with a reduction in DNA breakage in the holobiont fraction. This discordancy in DNA breakage between the three cellular compartments reveals that the holobiont cell fraction is more vulnerable to increased natural UV irradiation and associated anthropogenic genotoxic impacts, providing another possible explanation for recent increase in worldwide coral bleaching events.",COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",English,"Baruch, R (Corresponding Author), Natl Inst Oceanog, Israel Oceanog \& Limnol Res, POB 8030, IL-31080 Haifa, Israel.

The warm inshore bays and cooler offshore reefs of Palau share a variety of coral species with differing endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (genus: Symbiodinium), with the thermally tolerant Symbiodinium trenchii (S. trenchii) (= type D1a or D1-4) predominating under the elevated temperature regimes inshore, and primarily Clade C types in the cooler reefs offshore. Spectral reflectance of two species of stony coral, Cyphastrea serailia (C. serailia) and Pachyseris rugosa (P. rugosa), from both inshore and offshore locations shared multiple features both between sites and to similar global data from other studies. No clear reflectance features were evident which might serve as markers of thermally tolerant S. trenchii symbionts compared to the same species of coral with different symbionts. Reflectance from C. serailia colonies from inshore had a fluorescence peak at approximately 500 nm which was absent from offshore animals. Integrated reflectance across visible wavelengths had an inverse correlation to symbiont cell density and could be used as a relative indicator of the symbiont abundance for each type of coral. As hypothesized, coral colonies from offshore with Clade C symbionts showed a greater response to experimental heating, manifested as decreased symbiont density and increased reflectance or ``bleaching{''} than their inshore counterparts with S. trenchii.

Sometime between 2002 and 2004, O. patagonica became resistant to V. shiloi yet continued to bleach seasonally. These findings raised 2 questions: (1) What is the current cause of the bleaching? (2) How did the coral become resistant to the pathogen V. shiloi? Data presented here indicate that a bacterium, or bacteria, other than V. shiloi is currently responsible for the bleaching, because the antibiotic nalidixic acid inhibited heat-induced bleaching in aquaria. Raising the temperature of O. patagonica in aquaria to 31 C caused 24 of 28 coral fragments to bleach. When the O. patagonica was exposed to the same temperature increase but treated with nalidixic acid for 24 h when the temperature reached 28 degrees C, only 10 of 34 fragments bleached. Antibiotic-treated corals had 5.3-fold more zooxanthellae at the end of the heating experiment than the no-antibiotic control, supporting the visual bleaching observations. V. coralliilyticus strain EM1 is a candidate bleaching pathogen because it was isolated from bleached corals, caused bleaching in 5 of 6 antibiotic-treated corals and could be recovered from the experimentally bleached corals. In support of the coral probiotic hypothesis, anti biotictreated corals became sensitive to V. shiloi infection and bleaching (10 of 12 fragments), presumably by killing beneficial bacteria that inhibited V. shiloi growth. Bacterial strain EM3, isolated from O. patagonica fragments, may play a role in preventing V. shiloi infection of corals because it releases a diffusible material that specifically inhibited the growth of V. shiloi in vitro.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",English,"Rosenberg, E (Corresponding Author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Mol Microbiol \& Biotechnol, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.

One central key characteristic of all circadian rhythms is ``temperature compensation{''}, which allows organisms to maintain robust rhythms with a period close to a diel cycle over a broad range of physiological temperatures. To better understand the response of the circadian clock in corals to temperature elevation, photosynthesis as an output process of the circadian clock was studied both in Stylophora pistillata corals and in cultured Symbiodinium algae. The time period of photosynthesis was not affected by temperature elevation in the cultured algae or in the corals harbouring Symbiodinium.

Because the coral host depends on photosynthetic products assimilated from endosymbiotic algae, reef-building corals have to cope with irradiance fluctuations on instantaneous to seasonal time scales. Underwater high-frequency light fluctuations resulting from the lens effect on the water surface are prominent in oligotrophic coral reef environments, a phenomenon known as flicker light. Effects of flicker light on endosymbiont photosynthesis of the reef-building coral Acropora digitifera (Dana, 1846) were evaluated with pulse amplitude modulation chlorophyll fluorometry. At supersaturating light intensities, photosynthesis was less inhibited by flicker light than by constant light. Reduction in photoinhibition by flicker light was pronounced at high water temperatures. Flicker light may strongly influence endosymbiont photosynthesis of corals inhabiting shallow reef habitats, especially during periods of strong solar irradiance and high water temperature.",UNIV HAWAII PRESS,"2840 KOLOWALU ST, HONOLULU, HI 96822 USA",English,"Yamasaki, H (Corresponding Author), Univ Ryukyus, Fac Sci, Okinawa 9030213, Japan.

This octocoral has been observed to grow over both live and dead scleractinians and to dominate certain reefs in the Indo-Pacific region. The molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of H. coerulea to tolerate warmer seawater temperatures and to effectively compete for space on the substrate remain to be elucidated. Methods: In this study, we subjected H. coerulea colonies to various temperatures for up to 3 weeks. The growth and photosynthetic efficiency rates of the coral colonies were measured. We then conducted pairwise comparisons of gene expression among the different coral tissue regions to identify genes and pathways that are expressed under different temperature conditions. Results: A horizontal growth rate of 1.13 +/- 0.25 mm per week was observed for corals subjected to 28 or 31 degrees C. This growth rate was significantly higher compared to corals exposed at 26 degrees C. This new growth was characterized by the extension of whitish tissue at the edges of the colony and was enriched for a matrix metallopeptidase, a calcium and integrin binding protein, and other transcripts with unknown function. Tissues at the growth margin and the adjacent calcified encrusting region were enriched for transcripts related to proline and riboflavin metabolism, nitrogen utilization, and organic cation transport. The calcified digitate regions, on the other hand, were enriched for transcripts encoding proteins involved in cell-matrix adhesion, translation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, photosynthesis, and ion transport. Functions related to lipid biosynthesis, extracellular matrix formation, cell migration, and oxidation-reduction processes were enriched at the growth margin in corals subjected for 3 weeks to 28 or 31 degrees C relative to corals at 26 degrees C. In the digitate region of the coral, transcripts encoding proteins that protect against oxidative stress, modify cell membrane composition, and mediate intercellular signaling pathways were enriched after just 24 h of exposure to 31 degrees C compared to corals at 28 degrees C. The overall downregulation of gene expression observed after 3 weeks of sustained exposure to 31 degrees C is likely compensated by symbiont metabolism. Discussion: These findings reveal that the different regions of H. coerulea have variable gene expression profiles and responses to temperature variation. Under warmer conditions, the blue coral invests cellular resources toward extracellular matrix formation and cellular migration at the colony margins, which may promote rapid tissue growth and extension. This mechanism enables the coral to colonize adjacent reef substrates and successfully overgrow slower growing scleractinian corals that may already be more vulnerable to warming ocean waters.",PEERJ INC,"341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND",English,"Conaco, C (Corresponding Author), Univ Philippines Diliman, Coll Sci, Marine Sci Inst, Quezon City, Philippines.

In this study, the effects of bleaching (induced by elevated light and temperature) on the condition of symbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium sp.) within the tissue of the hard coral Stylophora pistillata (Esper) were assessed using a suite of techniques. Bleaching of S. pistillata was accompanied by declines in the maximum potential quantum yield of photosynthesis (F-v/F-m, measured using pulse amplitude modulated {[}PAM] fluorometry), an increase in the number of Sytox-green-stained algae (indicating compromised algal membrane integrity and cell death), an increase in 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluroscein diacetate (H(2)DCFDA)stained algae (indicating increased oxidative stress), as well as ultrastructural changes (vacuolisation, losses of chlorophyll, and an increase in accumulation bodies). Algae expelled from S. pistillata exhibited a complete disorganisation of cellular contents; expelled cells contained only amorphous material. In situ samples taken during a natural mass coral bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef in February 2002 also revealed a high number of Sytox-labelled algae cells in symbio. Dinoflagellate degeneration during bleaching seems to be similar to the changes resulting from senescence-phase cell death in cultured algae.

In corals, an inverse relationship between SST and skeletal Sr/Ca ratios has been found. However, this ratio might also vary with calcification, which in turn is dependent on light and temperature. The aim of this study was to improve our knowledge of the uptake of Sr2+ as a function of light and temperature in the scleractinian coral Acropora verweyi. Two experiments were performed in which nubbins were acclimated over 4 wk either to 3 light intensities (100, 200 and 400 mumol m(-2) s(1)) or to 3 temperatures (20, 25, and 29degreesC) and growth rates were monitored. At the end of the 4 wk, nubbins were incubated, under the above light levels and temperatures, in individual beakers containing seawater spiked with the radiotracer Sr-85. Parallel incubations were carried out in dark beakers, in order to compare rates of Sr2+ incorporation in light and dark. The results obtained showed that growth rates were significantly higher under high light (0.16 +/- 0.01 and 0.27 +/- 0.01\% d(-1) for 100 and 400 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1)) and under high temperature (0.06 +/- 0.01\% d(-1) at 20degreesC to 0.35 +/- 0.03\% d(-1) at 29degreesC). Rates of Sr2+ incorporation into the coral skeleton were also higher under high light (32.4 +/- 3.0, 72.9 +/- 13.5 and 91.2 +/- 9.0 nmol (g dry weight, DW)(-1) d(-1), for corals cultured at 100, 200 and 400 mumol m(-2) s(-1) respectively) and high temperature (89 +/- 14, 224 +/- 38 and 436 +/- 58 nmol (g DW)(-1) d(-1) for corals cultured at 20, 25 and 29degreesC respectively). Rates of Sr2+ uptake were also 2 to 3 times lower in the dark than in the light, comparable with the incorporation of calcium. Our results finally show a strong correlation between Sr2+ uptake and growth rates. Strontium uptake therefore follows the same pattern as calcium uptake, both ions being regulated by the calcification biochemistry.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",English,"Reynaud, S (Corresponding Author), Ctr Sci Monaco, Ave St Martin, MC-98000 Monaco, Monaco.

Since corals can thrive on mesophotic reefs under extreme light-limited conditions, we hypothesized that microskeletal coral features enhance light capture under low-light environments. Utilizing micro-computed tomography scanning, we conducted a novel comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) assessment of the small-scale skeleton morphology of the depth-generalist coral Stylophora pistillata collected from shallow (4-5 m) and mesophotic (45-50 m) depths. We detected a high phenotypic diversity between depths, resulting in two distinct morphotypes, with calyx diameter, theca height, and corallite marginal spacing contributing to most of the variation between depths. To determine whether such depth-specific morphotypes affect coral light capture and photosynthesis on the corallite scale, we developed 3D simulations of light propagation and photosynthesis. We found that microstructural features of corallites from mesophotic corals provide a greater ability to use solar energy under light-limited conditions; while corals associated with shallow morphotypes avoided excess light through self-shading skeletal architectures. The results from our study suggest that skeleton morphology plays a key role in coral photoadaptation to light-limited environments.

Toxicity of metals, such as copper (Cu), is expected to be enhanced with OA. However, the interaction between these environmental stressors is still poorly evaluated. In the present study, the interactive effects of seawater acidification and increasing Cu concentrations were evaluated in a zooxanthellate scleractinian coral (Mussismilia harttii), using biochemical biomarkers involved in the coral calcification process and the photosynthetic metabolism of endosymbionts. Corals were kept under control conditions (no seawater acidification and no Cu addition in seawater) or exposed to combined treatments of reduced seawater pH (8.1, 7.8, 7.5 and 7.2) and environmentally relevant concentrations of dissolved Cu (measured: 1.0, 1.6, 2.3 and 3.2 mu g/L) in a mesocosm system. After 15- and 35-days exposure, corals were analyzed for photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), chlorophyll a content, Ca-ATPase and carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity. Results showed that 76\% of the interactions between reduced seawater pH and increasing Cu concentrations were antagonistic. Only 24\% of these interactions were additive or synergistic. In general, the combination of stressors had no significant deleterious effects in the photosynthetic metabolism of endosymbionts or Ca-ATPase activity. In fact, the lowest dissolved Cu concentration tested had a consistent positive effect on Ca-ATPase activity in corals facing any of the reduced seawater pH conditions tested. In turn, potentially deleterious effects on acid-base balance in M. harttii, associated with changes in CA activity, were intensified by the combination of stressors. Findings reported here indicate that Cu toxicity in future OA scenarios can be less severe than previously suggested in this coral holobiont.",ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",English,"Marangoni, LFB (Corresponding Author), Univ Fed Rio Grande, Inst Oceanog, Programa Posgrad Oceanog Biol, Av Italia,Km 8, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.

In these habitats, species must tolerate lower annual mean temperature, wider annual temperature ranges and lower minimum temperatures. To understand ecophysiological traits that will impact geographical range boundaries, we monitored populations of five coral species within a marginal habitat and used a year of in situ measures to model thermal performance of vital host, symbiont and holobiont physiology. Metabolic responses to temperature revealed two acclimatization strategies: peak productivity occurring at annual midpoint temperatures (4-6 degrees C lower than tropical counterparts), or at annual maxima. Modelled relationships between temperature and P:R were compared to a year of daily subtropical sea temperatures and revealed that the relatively short time spent at any one temperature, limited optimal performance of all strategies to approximately half the days of the year. Thus, while subtropical corals can adjust their physiology to persist through seasonal lows, seasonal variation seems to be the key factor limiting coral productivity.

The coral host plays a major role in supplying carbon for the photosynthesis by the algal symbionts through a system similar to the carbon-concentrating mechanism described in free living algal cells;The details of carbon supply to the calcification process are almost unknown, but metabolic CO2 seems to be a significant source; Calcium supply for calcification is diffusional through oral layers, and active membrane transport only occurs between the calicoblastic cells and the site of calcification. Photosynthesis and calcification are tightly coupled in zooxanthellate scleractinian corals and coral reef communities. Calcification Is, on average, three times higher in light than in darkness. The recent suggestion that calcification is dark-repressed rather than light-enhanced is not supported by the literature. There is a very strong correlation between photosynthesis and calcification at both the organism and community levels, but the ratios of calcification to gross photosynthesis (0.6 in corals and 0.2 in reef communities) differ from unity, and from each other as a function of level. The potential effect of global climatic changes (pCO(2) and temperature) on the rate of calcification is also reviewed. In various calcifying photosynthetic organisms and communities, the rate of calcification decreases as a function of increasing pCO(2) and decreasing calcium carbonate saturation state, The calculated decrease in CaCO3 production, estimated using the scenarios considered by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), is 10\% between 1880 and 1990, and 9-30\% (mid estimate: 22\%) from 1990 to 2100.

In this study, the impacts of hypoxia on the scleractinian coral Pocillopora damicornis were explored. The algal symbiont density, chlorophyll a + c2 content, energy consumption of corals, as well as energy available and consumption of their symbionts, decreased significantly post hypoxia stress. Meanwhile, the malondialdehyde contents in corals and symbionts, together with the caspase-3 activation level in corals, increased significantly in response to hypoxia stress. Furthermore, it was revealed that activities such as coral cell division and calcification were inhibited under hypoxia. These results collectively suggest that acute hypoxia stress reduces symbiont density and chlorophyll a + c2 content in the coral P. damicornis by elevating intracellular oxidative pressure and apoptotic level, which further suppresses energy metabolism in the symbiotic association and negatively affects a series of activities such as coral cell division and calcification.",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",English,"Liu, ZQ; Zhou, Z (Corresponding Author), Hainan Univ, Haikou 570228, Peoples R China.

To gain insight into this process, two mesocosm-based experiments were conducted in Southern Taiwan with the model reef-building coral Pocillopora damicornis. In the first study, temperature was gradually elevated to 32 degrees C, though reduced to ambient levels at night, in order to simulate a temperature profile that can characterize intertidal reefs of Southern Taiwan. All corals acclimated to such conditions over the course of the month-long experiment, as evidenced by a variety of physiological and sub-cellular responses. In the second experiment, corals were exposed continually to 31.5 degrees C for two weeks, and, in contrast to results from the first study, the majority of the corals died, revealing that prolonged exposure to this temperature is lethal for this dominant reef builder of many regions of the Pacific Ocean.

Toxin P was produced during the stationary phase when the bacterium was grown on peptone or Casamino Acids media at 29 degreesC. Glycerol inhibited the production of toxin P. Toxin P was purified to homogeneity, yielding the following 12-residue peptide: PYPVYAPPPVVP (molecular weight, 1,295.54). The structure of toxin P was confirmed by chemical synthesis. Tn the presence of 12.5 mM NH4Cl, pure natural or synthetic toxin P (10 muM) caused a 64\% decrease in the photosynthetic quantum yield of zooxanthellae within 5 min. The inhibition nas proportional to the toxin P concentration. Toxin P bound avidly to zooxanthellae, such that subsequent addition of NK,CI resulted in rapid inhibition of photosynthesis. When zooxanthellae were incubated in the presence of NH,CI and toxin P, there was a rapid decrease in the pH (pH 7.8 to 7.2) of the bulk liquid, suggesting that toxin P facilitates transport of NH, into the cell, It is known that uptake of NH, into cells can destroy the pH gradient and block photosynthesis.

Understanding the processes and micro-ecological mechanisms of coral symbionts in response to bleaching is crucial as evidence accumulates that micro-organisms (particularly the bacteria) contribute to the health and recovery of coral, especially during heat stress. However, the exact functional mechanism of bacteria has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we performed metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses of healthy and bleached Acropora muricata corals to identify taxonomic and functional shifts in coral symbionts during a natural thermal bleaching event on Hainan Island. The results showed that symbiont species tended to be more abundant in bleached corals than healthy corals, and the bacterial community appeared to be crucial to coral bleaching. The relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens dramatically increased in bleached corals, accompanied by the reduction of beneficial bacteria. In addition, a direct comparison of metagenomic data sets indicated major changes in functional genes, with bleached corals exhibiting significant metabolic enrichment, while healthy corals maintained lower metabolism and energy consumption. Carbohydrate-active enzyme genes were remarkably activated, and virulence factors were highly represented in bleached corals, which was directly related to the increased abundance of pathogenic bacteria. Metaproteomic analysis also demonstrated that bleaching greatly affected photosynthesis and energy metabolism of coral symbionts. Among them, the biological processes of photosynthesis and chlorophyll biosynthesis were common in healthy corals, while pathways involved in gluconeogenesis and apoptosis were significantly enriched in bleached corals. Bacteria-mediated processes in healthy corals contribute to maintaining the basic functions of symbionts and resisting stress, whereas the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria in bleached corals leads to metabolic abnormalities of symbionts, showing enhanced energy metabolism and catalytic activity. In summary, the two omics analyzes revealed that bleaching caused enormous physiological damage to corals, and bacterial imbalance and dysfunction were the potential micro-ecological mechanisms underlying this event.IMPORTANCECoral reefs worldwide are facing rapid decline due to coral bleaching. However, knowledge of the physiological characteristics and molecular mechanisms of coral symbionts respond to stress is scarce. Here, metagenomic and metaproteomic approaches were utilized to shed light on the changes in the composition and functions of coral symbiotic bacteria during coral bleaching. The results demonstrated that coral bleaching significantly affected the composition of symbionts, with bacterial communities dominating in bleached corals. Through differential analyses of gene and protein expression, it becomes evident that symbionts experience functional disturbances in response to heat stress. These disturbances result in abnormal energy metabolism, which could potentially compromise the health and resilience of the symbionts. Furthermore, our findings highlighted the highly diverse microbial communities of coral symbionts, with beneficial bacteria providing critical services to corals in stress responses and pathogenic bacteria driving coral bleaching. This study provides comprehensive insights into the complex response mechanisms of coral symbionts under heat stress from the micro-ecological perspective and offers fundamental data for future monitoring of coral health.

The onset and occurrence of this coral bleaching is primarily defined via the dinoflagellate responses. Here we demonstrate that thermal stress responses occur in the coral host tissues in the days before the onset of coral bleaching. The observed sequence of thermal responses includes reductions in thickness of coral tissue layers and apoptosis of the cells prior to reductions in symbiont density. In the days before the onset of coral bleaching the outer coral tissue layer (epithelium) thickness reduces and apoptosis occurs within the gastrodermis. Two days following this, coinciding with an initial reduction of symbiont density (by approximately 25\%), gastrodermal thickness decreased and apoptosis of host cells was identified in the epithelium. This was eventually followed by large reduction in symbiont density (by approximately 50\%) consistent with coral bleaching. Both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes are identified in the reef building coral Acropora aspera, demonstrating the necessary pathways are present for fine control of host apoptosis. Our study shows that defining periods of host stress based on the responses defined by dinoflagellate symbiont underestimates the importance of early cellular events and the cellular complexity of coral host.

Q09017",GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS,2005,6,NA,NA,27-Sep,"[}1] The extremely high temporal resolution ( nearly daily interval) measurement was conducted on the coral (Porites lutea) oxygen isotope compositions (delta(18)Oc) to examine the detailed relationship between delta(18)Oc and sea surface temperature (SST) and seawater oxygen isotope composition (delta(18)Ow) from Hainan Island, China. Although SST and sea surface salinity (SSS) or delta(18)Ow varied in a wide range at the studied site, the dynamic range of delta(18)Oc recorded in coral was much smaller than expected from SST and SSS (delta(18)Ow) changes. The extremely high (> 30 degrees C) and low (< 22 degrees C) SST and low (< 27) SSS are not suitable for coral calcification, and coral could not record the information as their skeletal delta O-18. Estimated coral extension rates ( the overall rate is 15 mm/year) varied by a factor of about 18 within one year, from very slow in winter to very fast in spring. Light availability could affect the extension rate of coral skeleton through the activity of photosynthesis of symbiont algae. Such cessation and acceleration of calcification cause a serious distortion of the delta O-18 profile, which makes it difficult to make a correlation between delta O-18 and SST. Because high and low extension rates correspond to low- and high-density bands, respectively, a detailed examination of the density structure may assist the correction for distortion of the delta O-18 profile.",AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",English,"Shimamura, M (Corresponding Author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Earth Sci, N10W5, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan.

The green alga is present in very small numbers and is capable of photoheterotrophy based on growth in the presence of an inhibitor of photosynthesis, DCMU, with glycerol provided as a carbon source. The presence of zoochlorellae (Chl a + b), in soft corals appears to have been unsuspected. The easily cultured green alga was unicellular, unflagellated and very small, c. 2 to 6 mu m in diameter and had a relatively high Chl b content (Chl b/a = 0.379 +/- 0.063). Rapid light curves using PAM fluorometry on the cultured cells showed that Yield vs. irradiance had a low maximum yield (Y-max, 0.388 +/- 0.0132; Irradiance 1/2 point, E-1/2 Ymax = 139 +/- 11.1 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1)). The overall optimum irradiance (E-opt) for the alga was 314 +/- 18.8 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1). The alga can photosynthesize at 50\% or more of the optimum rate from 70 to 900 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1) but would be severely inhibited under full sunlight. Most naturally occurring low irradiance habitats may have a low median irradiance but are exposed intermittently to very high irradiances and so a relatively high E-opt is advantageous in minimizing photochemical damage. Like the green algal symbiont Elliptochloris marina of sea anemones, Chlorella cf. vulgaris is not exclusively marine: it grows better in freshwater medium where it has different photosynthetic characteristics (higher Y-max, E-opt and ETRmax). Chlorella cf. vulgaris appears to be capable of photoheterotrophy and it is not clear if it is a symbiont, a commensal or a parasite.",TAYLOR \& FRANCIS LTD,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",English,"Ritchie, RJ (Corresponding Author), Prince Songkla Univ Phuket, Fac Technol \& Environm, Phuket 83120, Thailand.

Surprisingly, scientists are continually discovering that naturally extreme environments house established coral populations adapted to grow within extreme abiotic conditions comparable to seawater conditions predicted over the coming century. Such environments include inshore mangrove lagoons that carry previously unrecognised ecosystem service value for corals, spanning from refuge to stress preconditioning. However, the existence of such hot-spots of resilience on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) remains entirely unknown. Here we describe, for the first time, 2 extreme GBR mangrove lagoons (Woody Isles and Howick Island), exposing taxonomically diverse coral communities (34 species, 7 growth morphologies) to regular extreme low pH (<7.6), low oxygen (<1 mg l(-1)) and highly variable temperature range (>7 degrees C) conditions. Coral cover was typically low (<5 \%), but highly patchy and included established colonies (>0.5 m diameter), with net photosynthesis and calcification rates of 2 dominant coral species (Acropora millepora, Porites lutea) reduced (20-30 \%), and respiration enhanced (11-35 \%), in the mangrove lagoon relative to adjacent reefs. Further analysis revealed that physiological plasticity (photosynthetic `strategy') and flexibility of Symbiodiniaceae taxa associations appear crucial in supporting coral capacity to thrive from reef to lagoon. Prevalence of corals within these extreme conditions on the GBR (and elsewhere) increasingly challenge our understanding of coral resilience to stressors, and highlight the need to study unfavourable coral environments to better resolve mechanisms of stress tolerance.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",English,"Camp, EF (Corresponding Author), Univ Technol Sydney, Climate Change Cluster, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.

Nonetheless, studies simultaneously investigating the effects of warming on all holobiont members are lacking. Here we show that exposure to increased temperature affects key physiological traits of all members (herein: animal host, zooxanthellae and diazotrophs) of both Stylophora pistillata and Acropora hemprichii during and after thermal stress. S. pistillata experienced severe loss of zooxanthellae (i.e., bleaching) with no net photosynthesis at the end of the experiment. Conversely, A. hemprichii was more resilient to thermal stress. Exposure to increased temperature (+ 6 degrees C) resulted in a drastic increase in daylight dinitrogen (N-2) fixation, particularly in A. hemprichii (threefold compared with controls). After the temperature was reduced again to in situ levels, diazotrophs exhibited a reversed diel pattern of activity, with increased N-2 fixation rates recorded only in the dark, particularly in bleached S. pistillata (twofold compared to controls). Concurrently, both animal hosts, but particularly bleached S. pistillata, reduced both organic matter release and heterotrophic feeding on picoplankton. Our findings indicate that physiological plasticity by coral-associated diazotrophs may play an important role in determining the response of coral holobionts to ocean warming.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Cardini, U (Corresponding Author), Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Ecol ZMT, Coral Reef Ecol Grp CORE, Fahrenheitstr 6, DE-28359 Bremen, Germany.

However, static temperature manipulations may underestimate the thermal complexity of the reefs in which many corals live. For instance, corals of Houbihu, Taiwan, experience changes in temperature of up to 10 degrees C over the course of a day during spring-tide upwelling events. To better understand the phenotypic plasticity of these corals, a laboratory-based experiment was conducted whereby specimens of Seriatopora hystrix from an upwelling reef (Houbihu) and conspecifics from a non-upwelling reef (Houwan) were exposed to both a stable seawater temperature (26 degrees C) regime and a regime characterized by a 6 degrees C fluctuation (23-29 degrees C) over a 12. h period for 7. days. A suite of physiological and molecular parameters was measured in samples of both treatments, as well as in experimental controls, to determine site of origin (SO) and temperature treatment (TT) responses. Only chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration and growth demonstrated the hypothesized trend of higher levels when exposed to a TT that mimicked SO conditions. In contrast, chl a, maximum dark-adapted quantum yield of photosystem II (F-v/F-m), and Symbiodinium ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rbcL), photosystem I (psI, subunit III) and phosphoglycolate phosphatase (pgpase) mRNA expression demonstrated significant TT effects. Specifically, levels of these response variables were higher in samples exposed to a variable temperature regime, suggesting that S. hystrix may acclimate to fluctuating temperatures by increasing its capacity for photosynthesis.",COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",English,"Mayfield, AB (Corresponding Author), Natl Museum Marine Biol \& Aquarium, Checheng, Pingtung, Taiwan.

Advances in antifouling technology include the use of nanomaterials. Herein we test an antifouling nano-additive based on the encapsulation of the biocide 4,5-dichloro-2-octyl-4isothiazolin-3-one (DCOIT) in engineered silica nanocontainers (SiNC). The work aims to assess the biochemical and physiological effects on the symbiotic coral Sarcophyton cf. glaucum caused by (1) thermal stress and (2) DCOIT exposure (free or nanoencapsulated forms), in a climate change scenario. Accordingly, the following hypotheses were addressed: (H1) ocean warming can cause toxicity on S. cf. glaucum; (H2) the nanoencapsulation process decreases DCOIT toxicity towards this species; (H3) the biocide toxicity, free or encapsulated forms, can be affected by ocean warming. Coral fragments were exposed for seven days to DCOIT in both free and encapsulated forms, SiNC and negative controls, under two water temperature regimes (26 degrees C and 30.5 degrees C). Coral polyp behavior and photosynthetic efficiency were determined in the holobiont, while biochemical markers were assessed individually in the endosymbiont and coral host. Results showed transient coral polyp retraction and diminished photosynthetic efficiency in the presence of heat stress or free DCOIT, with effects being magnified in the presence of both stressors. The activity of catalase and glutathione-S-transferase were modulated by temperature in each partner of the symbiosis. The shifts in enzymatic activity were more pronounced in the presence of free DCOIT, but to a lower extent for encapsulated DCOIT. Increased levels of oxidative damage were detected under heat conditions.

As there are concerns that global increasing temperatures may compromise the survival of this species, which forms a symbiotic relationship with the diatom Nitzschia sp., we investigated the response of the B. sphaerulata holobiont from the intertidal algal flats of Xiao Liu Chiu Island, Taiwan to heat shock B. sphaerulata specimens were incubated at 26 (ambient), 28, 30, 32, or 34 degrees C for 5 h designed to simulate short pulses of elevated temperature that occur in situ from subaerial exposure at low tide. To assess the molecular-level response, we measured the expression of the ribulose 1-5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) protein in the diatom symbiont There was a significant decrease in expression of this rate-limiting carbon fixation enzyme in B. sphaerulata holobionts incubated at 34 degrees C/8 degrees C above ambient (similar to 50\% decline relative to controls), but expression was resilient to levels of warming up to 6 degrees C above ambient. This suggests that exposure to high temperatures occasionally experienced in nature may diminish the capacity for carbon fixation of the diatom symbiont. Given the importance of photosynthesis and carbon fixation in these marine calcifiers, these data suggest that climate-driven ocean warming may exert deleterious effects on the B. sphaerulata holobiont.

Various methods have previously been described for the production of cell cultures in vitro with a range of success and longevity. In this study, viable tissue spheroids containing host tissue and symbionts (coral explants) were grown from the tissues of Fungia granulosa. The cultured explants remained viable for over 2 months and showed morphological similarities in tissue structure and internal microenvironment to reef-building scleractinian corals. The photophysiology of the explants (1 week old) closely matched that of the parent coral F. granulosa. This study provides the first empirical basis for supporting the use of coral explants as laboratory models for studying coral symbioses.

In this study, we assessed the carbon budget in Pocillopora damicornis (using (HCO3)-C-13) as a function of feeding status and temperature stress. We also compared dissolved oxygen (O-2) fluxes measured at the colony scale and at the polyp scale. At both scales, O-2 production rates were enhanced for fed vs. unfed corals, and unfed corals exhibited higher bleaching and reduced photosynthetic activity at high temperature. Unfed corals exclusively respired autotrophically acquired carbon, while fed corals mostly respired heterotrophically acquired carbon. As a consequence, fed corals excreted on average > 5 times more organic carbon than unfed corals. Photosynthate translocation was higher under thermal stress, but most of the carbon was lost via respiration and/or mucus release (42-46\% and 57-75\% of the fixed carbon for unfed and fed corals, respectively). Such high loss of translocated carbon, coupled to low assimilation rates in the coral tissue and symbionts, suggests that P. damicornis was nitrogen and/or phosphorus limited. Heterotrophy might thus cover a larger portion of the nutritional demand for P. damicornis than previously assumed. Our results suggest that active feeding plays a fundamental role in metabolic dynamics and bleaching susceptibility of corals.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",English,"Lyndby, NH (Corresponding Author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Marine Biol Sect, Strandpromenaden 5, DK-3000 Helsingor, Denmark.

In this study, we experimentally exposed aposymbiotic (lacking symbionts) and symbiotic primary polyps of the scleractinian coral Acropora digitifera to several seawater temperatures (27, 29, 31, and 33 degrees C) and salinities (26, 28. 30, 32, and 34) to investigate the effects of thermal and freshening stresses on coral calcification from the standpoint of coral-algal symbiosis. Calcification rates were higher for symbiotic versus aposymbiotic polyps in both sets of experiments, except for those reared at 31 degrees C and 33 degrees C. Calcification responses of symbiotic polyps were a non-linear function of temperature, and the threshold temperature affecting skeletal growth and bleaching was between 29 degrees C and 31 degrees C. Calcification rates of aposymbiotic polyps were also a non-linear function of temperature, with a maximum polyp weight at 31 degrees C, suggesting that thermal stress also did some damage to the coral host itself. In contrast, skeletal growth of both aposymbiotic and symbiotic polyps decreased linearly with increased salinity. Observations of the microstructure of polyp samples revealed a clearly cyclic feature of skeletal surfaces that was likely related to organo-mineral deposition of calcium carbonate even under lowered-salinity conditions. However, neither type of polyp reared at 33 degrees C evidenced this characteristic, suggesting that thermal stress had compromised the normal calcification process, which involves secretion of an organic matrix by the coral host. Our results suggest that the effects of future global warming will include a reduction in coral calcification itself and the collapse of coral-algal symbiosis, at least at the primary polyp stage. The present experiments showed that thermal stress would affect the host's physiological functionality, whereas freshening stress, which is simply the dilution of ambient seawater, would affect the mineralization process associated with coral calcification.

Elevated temperatures can disrupt the normal physiological functioning of photosynthetic organisms by altering the fluidity and permeability of chloroplast membranes that is defined and regulated by their lipid composition. Since the habitat-forming reef corals rely on the obligatory symbiosis with dinoflagellates of the family Symbiodiniaceae, their heat stress response can be expected to be strongly influenced by the symbiont's lipid metabolism. However, in contrast to the steady increase in the knowledge of the functioning of coral symbionts at the genomic and transcriptomic level, the understanding of their membrane lipid composition and regulation in response to temperature stress is lagging behind. We have utilised mass spectrometry-based lipidomic analyses to identify the key polar lipids that form the biological membranes of reef coral symbionts, comparing the thermotolerant species Durusdinium trenchii with the thermosensitive taxon Cladocopium C3, both hosted by Acropora valida. Our results indicate that the superior thermotolerance D. trenchii inside the host corals could be achieved through (1) the amount and saturation of sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerols, in particular through putative photosystem II interactions, (2) the increased digalactosyldiacylglycerol to monogalactosyldiacylglycerol ratio with the potential to stabilise thylakoid membranes and integrated proteins, and (3) the chaperone-like function of lyso-lipids. Thereby, our study provides novel insights into the heat tolerance of coral symbionts, contributing to the understanding of the potential of coral reef ecosystems to respond and adjust to heat stress events that are becoming more frequent due to climate change. Finally, our identification of multiple mechanisms of heat tolerance in Symbiodiniaceae furthers the knowledge of the general stress physiology of photosynthetic organisms.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"D'Angelo, C (Corresponding Author), Univ Southampton, Coral Reef Lab, Waterfront Campus, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.

These processes support the foundation of coral reefs by directly influencing biogeochemical nutrient cycles and complex ecological interactions and therefore represent key knowledge required for effective reef management. However, metabolic rates are not trivial to quantify and typically rely on the use of cumbersome in situ respirometry chambers and/or the need to remove material and examine ex situ, thereby fundamentally limiting the scale, resolution and possibly the accuracy of the rate data. Here we describe a novel low-cost in situ respirometry bag that mitigates many constraints of traditional glass and plexi-glass incubation chambers. We subsequently demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel ``Flexi-Chamber{''} approach via two case studies: 1) the Flexi-Chamber provides values of P, R and G for the reef-building coral Siderastrea cf. stellata collected from reefs close to Salvador, Brazil, which were statistically similar to values collected from a traditional glass respirometry vessel; and 2) wide-scale application of obtaining P, R and G rates for different species across different habitats to obtain inter- and intra-species differences. Our novel cost-effective design allows us to increase sampling scale of metabolic rate measurements in situ without the need for destructive sampling and thus significantly expands on existing research potential, not only for corals as we have demonstrated here, but also other important benthic groups.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",English,"Camp, EF (Corresponding Author), Univ Essex, Sch Biol Sci, Coral Reef Res Unit, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.

Pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) chlorophyll fluorescence techniques were used to assess the effects on the photosynthetic efficiency of the algal symbionts in the tissue (in Symbio), and chlorophyll fluorescence and counts of symbiotic algae (normalised to surface area) were used to assess the extent of coral bleaching. At 30 mug DCMU l(-1), there was a reduction in both the maximum effective quantum yield (DeltaF/F-m') and maximum potential quantum yield (F-v/F-m) of the algal symbionts in symbio. Corals subsequently lost their algal symbionts and discoloured (bleached), especially on their upper sunlight-exposed surfaces. At the same DCMU concentration but under low light (5\% of growth irradiance), there was a marked reduction in DeltaF/F-m' but only a slight reduction in F-v/F-m and slight loss of algae. Loss of algal symbionts was also noted after a 7 d exposure to concentrations as low as 10 mug DCMU l(-1) under normal growth irradiance, and after 14 d exposure to 10 mug DCMU l(-1) under reduced irradiance. Collectively the results indicate that DCMU-induced bleaching is caused by a light-dependent photoinactivation of algal symbionts, and that bleaching occurs when F-v/F-n, (measured 2 h after sunset) is reduced to a value of less than or equal to 0.6. Elevated copper concentrations (60 mug Cu l(-1) for 10 h) also induced a rapid bleaching in S. hystrix but without affecting the quantum yield of the algae in symbio. Tests with isolated algae indicated that substantially higher concentrations (300 mug Cu l(-1) for 8 h) were needed to significantly reduce the quantum yield. Thus, copper-induced bleaching occurs without affecting the algal photosynthesis and may be related to effects on the host (animal). It is argued that warm-water bleaching of corals resembles both types of chemically induced bleaching, suggesting the need for an integrated model of coral bleaching involving the effect of temperature on both host (coral) and algal symbionts.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",English,"Jones, RJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Queensland, Ctr Marine Studies, St Lucia Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.

Saturation state of surface seawater is decreasing in response to increases in atmospheric PCO2, causing concern for a global reduction in the rates of reef accretion. In this study we address the influences of light and saturation state on skeletal growth of the hermatypic coral Porites compressa. We conducted 2 experiments using coral nubbins; one in a controlled laboratory with Biosphere 2 ocean water and the other in the 711 m(2) Biosphere 2 ocean itself, The laboratory experiment consisted of 3 light treatments (PAR = 698, 150, 81 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) and 2 chemical treatments (pCO(2) = 199 mu atm, Omega = 5.05, CO32- = 355 mu mol kg(-1); and pCO(2) = 448 mu atm, Omega = 2.48, CO32- = 183 mu mol kg(-1)). In the Biosphere 2 ocean, coral nubbins were deployed at 4 depths (6, 4, 2 and 0.5 m) which, corresponded to different light conditions (PAR from 2.7 to 29.5 mol photons m(-2) d(-1)) during 3 different chemical states, mimicking the conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the present day and the year 2100 (Y2100). Calcification rate changed with light following the typical hyperbolic tangent function. Calcification rate was positively correlated with saturation state, which ranged from 5 (LGM) to 2.4 (Y2100), From the glacial experimental conditions (Omega = 5.05, pCO(2) = 186) to those of the future (Omega = 2.25, pCO(2) = 641), calcification dropped by 30\%; from present day conditions (Omega = 3.64, pCO(2) = 336) to those of the future, calcification dropped by 11\%.

While most coral reef studies focus on the effects of thermal stress and ocean acidification, few studies acknowledge the threat of hypoxia. Hypoxia is traditionally defined as 6.3 kPa (2 mg L-1 O2), however, a universal hypoxia threshold is not useful given the vast range of responses among marine organisms. The range of metabolic responses and tolerances to hypoxia are unknown for Caribbean coral species and their algal symbionts. ObjectiveHere, we quantified the spectrum of acute hypoxia tolerances and the range of metabolic responses of six ecologically and structurally important Caribbean coral species (Acropora cervicornis, Siderastrea radians, Siderastrea siderea, Porites astreoides, Porites porites, and Orbicella faveolata) and their algal symbionts (Symbiodinium, Breviolum, and Durusdinium spp.). MethodsA total of 24 coral fragments (4 individuals per species) were exposed to 10 distinct oxygen concentrations ranging from normoxia (20.38 kPa) to severe hypoxia (3.3 kPa). We used intermittent flow respirometry to measure coral host respiration in the dark and algal symbiont photosynthesis in the light at each oxygen level. We determined a line of best fit for the metabolic rate vs. PO2 data and calculated the critical oxygen partial pressure (PO2 crit), a method that has not been tested on symbiotic species. ResultsCoral species and their algal symbionts measured here displayed a wide range of hypoxia tolerances. For the coral hosts, PO2 crit values differed roughly two-fold ranging from 5.74 kPa to 16.93 kPa, and for the algal symbionts, PO2 crit values differed roughly three-fold ranging from 3.9 kPa to 11.3 kPa. DiscussionThese results should be regarded as a first step to characterizing the metabolic response and acute tolerance of multiple coral hosts and algal symbionts to a wide range of oxygen concentrations. Given that some PO2 crit values were above the generally accepted hypoxia threshold, these results have implications for the community composition of reefs under a rapidly changing climate and can guide purposeful reef restoration.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",English,"Pontes, E (Corresponding Author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine Atmospher \& Earth Sci, Dept Marine Biol \& Ecol, Miami, FL 33136 USA.

Corals live in a narrow temperature range and become stressed when the temperatures change. Bleaching occurs when the temperature exceeds the coral's threshold, and can be severe when this is combined with other stressors such as light. In order to understand how temperature and light affect corals in their physiological responses and photosynthetic performance, Pocillopora acuta from Maiton Island (MT) and Panwa Cape (PW), representing different environments, were investigated. The results show that light and temperature had by regime different effects on Symbiodiniaceae photosynthesis and the coral growth rate. There was a synergistic effect of elevated temperature and light on photosynthesis, as observed in the photochemical efficiency and pigment contents, suggesting photo-damage. A higher growth rate in Panwa corals was observed in control, and while elevated temperature reduced coral growth. Elevated temperature affected the Panwa coral less, suggesting that corals from this regime might be able to recover when the temperature returns to normal. This information is important for predicting the coral responses to elevated temperature especially in the summer, as regards the possibility of coral bleaching.",MDPI,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",English,"Yucharoen, M (Corresponding Author), Prince Songkla Univ, Fac Environm Management, Hat Yai Dist 90110, Songkhla, Thailand.

Although coral calcification is supported by high seawater pH, photosynthesis by the algal symbionts of zooxanthellate corals can be promoted by elevated pCO(2). To investigate the mechanisms underlying corals' complex responses to global change, three species of tropical zooxanthellate corals (Stylophora pistillata, Pocillopora damicornis, and Seriatopora hystrix) and one species of asymbiotic cold-water coral (Desmophyllum pertusum, syn. Lophelia pertusa) were cultured under a range of ocean acidification and warming scenarios. Under control temperatures, all tropical species exhibited increased calcification rates in response to increasing pCO(2). However, the tropical species' response to increasing pCO(2) flattened when they lost symbionts (i.e., bleached) under the high-temperature treatments-suggesting that the loss of symbionts neutralized the benefit of increased pCO(2) on calcification rate. Notably, the cold-water species that lacks symbionts exhibited a negative calcification response to increasing pCO(2), although this negative response was partially ameliorated under elevated temperature. All four species elevated their calcifying fluid pH relative to seawater pH under all pCO(2) treatments, and the magnitude of this offset (Delta{[}H+]) increased with increasing pCO(2). Furthermore, calcifying fluid pH decreased along with symbiont abundance under thermal stress for the one species in which calcifying fluid pH was measured under both temperature treatments. This observation suggests a mechanistic link between photosymbiont loss ('bleaching') and impairment of zooxanthellate corals' ability to elevate calcifying fluid pH in support of calcification under heat stress. This study supports the assertion that thermally induced loss of photosymbionts impairs tropical zooxanthellate corals' ability to cope with CO2-induced ocean acidification.",MDPI,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",English,"Ries, JB (Corresponding Author), Northeastern Univ, Dept Marine \& Environm Sci, Nahant, MA 01908 USA.

Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) chlorophyll fluorescence techniques were used to assess the photosynthetic efficiency of the symbiotic dinoflagellates (dark-adapted F-v/F-m) in the coral tissues (in hospite) before, during and after exposure. Exposure to reduced-salinity seawater caused a marked reduction in efficiency (the ratio of variable {[}F-v] to maximal {[}F-m] fluorescence), and there was an apparent link between a reduction in dark-adapted F-v/F-m and a loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates from the corals. The reduction in F-v/F-m of the symbiotic algae and subsequent dissociation of the coral-algal symbiosis (coral bleaching) occurred during exposure to reduced-salinity seawater in either the light or dark. The results demonstrate that bleaching in response to low-salinity seawater is a truly sublethal response, contrary to a recent suggestion. The study also suggests that bleaching of corals in response to low-salinity seawater may not involve the passive loss of algal symbionts and that an impairment of the capacity of the algal symbionts for photosynthesis represents a common `cue' initiating the dissociation of the coral-algal symbiosis during exposure to sub-optimal conditions.

In normal environmental conditions, the coral gastrodermis contained zero to two zooxanthellae and maintained well-defined cortical and intracellular structures. When corals were exposed to HT, UV and FR, the gastrodermal features changed remarkably depending on the duration of exposure. Treatment with HT for 15 min or exposure to UV and FR for 6 h induced the appearance of numerous, small, electron-dense granules in the gastrodermis. Autophagosomes and lysosomes in the gastrodermal cells also increased in number. The gastrodermal cells containing no zooxanthellae began to degrade and became vacuolated through the destruction and fragmentation of their cytoplasmic contents. Prolonged exposure to these stressors brought about the disintegration of the cells without zooxanthellae and led to the collapse of the gastrodermis. This resulted in the release of the other gastrodermal cells containing zooxanthellae from the gastrodermis to gastrovascular cavities. HT, UV and FR affected the gastrodermal cells without zooxanthellae more severely than the zooxanthellae themselves, although the thylakoids of the zooxanthellae were often destroyed when the coral was exposed to UV and FR. These results suggest that the coral receives the distinct stressors, HT, UV and FR, but has a common mechanism that promotes autolysis activities in the gastrodermis and discharges cells containing zooxanthellae.",UNIV TOKYO CYTOLOGIA,"TOSHIN BLDG, HONGO 2-27-2, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113-0031, JAPAN",English,"Camaya, AP (Corresponding Author), Kochi Univ, Grad Sch Kuroshio Sci, 2-5-1 Akebono Cho, Kochi 7808520, Japan.

Our picosecond chlorophyll fluorescence experiments on cultured Symbiodinium Glade C cells exposed to coral bleaching conditions uncovered the transformations of the alga's photosynthetic apparatus (PSA) that activate an extremely efficient non-photochemical ``super-quenching{''} mechanism. The mechanism is associated with a transition from an initially heterogeneous photosystem II (PSII) pool to a homogeneous ``spillover{''} pool, where nearly all excitation energy is transferred to photosystem I (PSI). There, the inherently higher stability of PSI and high quenching efficiency of P-700(+) allow dumping of PSII excess excitation energy into heat, resulting in almost complete cessation of photosynthetic electron transport (PET). This potentially reversible ``super-quenching{''} mechanism protects the PSA against destruction at the cost of a loss of photosynthetic activity. We suggest that the inhibition of PET and the consequent inhibition of organic carbon production (e.g. sugars) in the symbiotic Symbiodinium provide a trigger for the symbiont expulsion, i.e. bleaching.

Under normal conditions, less than 5\% of the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) reaches the green endolithic algae because of the absorbance of light by the endosymbiotic dinoflagellates and the carbonate skeleton. When corals bleach (loose dinoflagellate symbionts), however, the tissue of the corals become highly transparent and photosynthetic microendoliths may be exposed to high levels of both thermal and solar stress. This study explores the consequence of these combined stresses on the phototrophic endoliths inhabiting the skeleton of Montipora monasteriata, growing at Heron Island, on the southern Great Barrier Reef. Endoliths that were exposed to sun after tissue removal were by far more susceptible to thermal photoinhibition and photo-damage than endoliths under coral tissue that contained high concentrations of brown dinoflagellate symbionts. While temperature or light alone did not result in decreased photosynthetic efficiency of the endoliths, combined thermal and solar stress caused a major decrease and delayed recovery. Endoliths protected under intact tissue recovered rapidly and photoacclimated soon after exposure to elevated sea temperatures. Endoliths under naturally occurring bleached tissue of M. monasteriata colonies (bleaching event in March 2004 at Heron Island) acclimated to increased irradiance as the brown symbionts disappeared. We suggest that two major factors determine the outcome of thermal bleaching to the endolith community. The first is the microhabitat and light levels under which a coral grows, and the second is the susceptibility of the coral-dinoflagellates symbiosis to thermal stress. More resistant corals may take longer to bleach allowing endoliths time to acclimate to a new light environment. This in turn may have implications for coral survival.",COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD,"BIDDER BUILDING CAMBRIDGE COMMERCIAL PARK COWLEY RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 4DL, CAMBS, ENGLAND",English,"Fine, M (Corresponding Author), Univ Queensland, Ctr Marine Studies, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.

This bleaching has frequently been attributed to photoinhibition of photosynthetic electron transport and the consequent photodamage to photosystem II (PSII) and the production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the zooxanthellae (Symbiodinium spp.). However, these events may be because of perturbations of other processes occurring within the zooxanthellae or the host cells, and consequently constitute only secondary responses to temperature increase. The processes involved with the onset of photoinhibition of electron transport, photodamage to PSII and pigment bleaching in coral zooxanthellae are reviewed. Consideration is given to how increases in temperature might lead to perturbations of metabolic processes in the zooxanthellae and/or their host cells, which could trigger events leading to bleaching. It is concluded that production of ROS by the thylakoid photosynthetic apparatus in the zooxanthellae plays a major role in the onset of bleaching resulting from photoinhibition of photosynthesis, although it is not clear which particular ROS are involved. It is suggested that hydrogen peroxide generated in the zooxanthellae may have a signalling role in triggering the mechanisms that result in expulsion of zooxanthellae from corals.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Baker, NR (Corresponding Author), Univ Essex, Coral Reef Res Unit, Dept Biol Sci, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.

However, the temporal dynamics of photoacclimation remain poorly characterized. We studied photoacclimation at several time points over 24 d in two scleractinian coral taxa (mounding Porites spp. and branching Acropora muricata). Coral specimens preacclimated at 24 degrees C and 171 mu mol quanta m-2 s-1 were exposed to three light levels (-32\%, +27\%, and +65\% relative to that of the acclimation period) at two temperatures (control, 24 degrees C; mildly stressful, 29 degrees C). Intra-tissue light environment-specifically, photon pressure per symbiont-increased dramatically with each additional light dose and again with increasing temperature in Porites spp.; net photosynthesis (Pnet) rates continued to change for at least 2 weeks following light increase but not light reduction, and vice versa for symbiont densities. Intra-tissue light environments were substantially dimmer and more homogeneous among all light treatments in A. muricata, which continued to increase its light-use efficiency and Pnet through time in most or all treatments. Consequently, prolonged change in Fv/Fm at elevated temperature in Porites spp. but not A. muricata may have been caused by differing photodamage loads. Moderation of light levels by conditions within the coral tissue seems to affect the temporal dynamics of the photoacclimation response, and this finding emphasizes new avenues for photoacclimation research.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Mason, RAB (Corresponding Author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.

In this perspective, we mapped the cascade of cellular events and physiological responses of symbiotic corals triggered by thermal stress. Based on existing knowledge, we created an integrated model that describes phenotypic changes induced by sensing mechanisms. Cellular responses are mapped in the context of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the algal symbiont chloroplast, followed by signaling to the nucleus and subsequent ``leak{''} to the coral host cell. The starting point is set by ROS production and signaling, which is a day-to-day mechanism by which symbiotic corals maintain homeostasis and acclimate to environmental variation. As stress and acclimation are intimately linked, our model maps coral responses from the initial stimulus in the chloroplast to the complex cascade of events leading to seasonal phenotypic changes (i.e., seasonal acclimation), and if stress progresses, to the downstream coral bleached phenotype (i.e., when the coral's capacity to acclimate is overwhelmed by heat stress).

Biochemical reactions within cells provide a snapshot of molecular regulation and flexibility during exposure to environmental stressors. However, because the organism is the unit of selection there is a need for the integration of metabolite data with organism physiology to understand mechanisms responsible for individual success under a changing climate. Objectives Our study aims to characterize the molecular response of reef corals to simulated global climate change stressors. Furthermore, we seek to relate changes in the molecular physiology to observations in overall colony response. Methods To this end, we applied a non-targeted metabolomic approach to describe lipid and primary metabolite composition after exposure of the reef-building coral Pocillopora damicornis to ambient and elevated experimental climate change conditions. We compared these metabolite data to organism physiology, specifically the key processes of photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification. Results Corals significantly altered their lipid and primary metabolite profiles in response to experimental treatments. Primary metabolite profiles predicted organisms' net photosynthesis, but not calcification or respiration measures. Despite challenges in metabolome annotation, our data indicated corals alter carbohydrate composition, cell structural lipids, and signaling compounds in response to elevated treatment conditions. Conclusions The integration of metabolite and physiological data highlights the predictive power of metabolomics in defining organism performance and provides biomarkers for future studies.

Successful coral recovery from severe bleaching events may depend on the rate of replenishment of algal symbiont populations following the period of thermal stress, the supply of an alternative food source, or both. Here, we explore the role of food availability in promoting the survival and recovery of a common coral (Acropora intermedia) following acute experimentally induced thermal stress. Fed corals were provided with live rotifers daily, to maintain densities of zooplankton in tanks that are typical of coral reefs. After a 6-week acclimation phase, heated corals were subjected to a +4 A degrees C thermal anomaly for a 7-day period (bleaching phase) then temperatures were returned to normal for a further 2 weeks (recovery phase). Results demonstrated that heated corals had higher survival when they were provided with heterotrophic food. Fed corals experienced reduced loss of chlorophyll a, relative to unfed corals. During the recovery phase, both fed and unfed corals recovered within a few days; however, fed corals recovered to pre-bleaching phase levels of chlorophyll a, whereas unfed corals stabilized approximately one-third below this level. Protein levels of fed corals declined markedly during the bleaching phase, but recovered all of their losses by the end of the recovery phase. In contrast, unfed corals had low protein levels that were maintained throughout the experiment. To the extent that these results are representative of corals' responses to thermal anomalies in nature, the findings imply that availability of particulate food matter has the potential to increase corals' capacity to survive thermally induced bleaching and to ameliorate its sub-lethal effects. They also support the hypothesis that different rates of heterotrophy are an important determinant of variation in resilience to thermal stress among reef environments.",SPRINGER,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",English,"Connolly, SR (Corresponding Author), James Cook Univ, Sch Marine \& Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.

Here, we develop a dynamic bioenergetic model of coral-Symbiodinium symbioses that demonstrates realistic steady-state patterns in coral growth and symbiont abundance across gradients of light, nutrients, and feeding. Furthermore, by including a mechanistic treatment of photo-oxidative stress, the model displays dynamics of bleaching and recovery that can be explained as transitions between alternate stable states. These dynamics reveal that ``healthy{''} and ``bleached{''} states correspond broadly to nitrogen- and carbon-limitation in the system, with transitions between them occurring as integrated responses to multiple environmental factors. Indeed, a suite of complex emergent behaviors reproduced by the model (e.g., bleaching is exacerbated by nutrients and attenuated by feeding) suggests it captures many important attributes of the system; meanwhile, its modular framework and open source R code are designed to facilitate further problem-specific development. We see significant potential for this modeling framework to generate testable hypotheses and predict integrated, mechanistic responses of corals to environmental change, with important implications for understanding the performance and maintenance of symbiotic systems.

Two sets of corals were grown with filtered seawater under controlled conditions. One group of colonies was fed Artemia sp. nauplii and compared to a control group that was starved. Fed corals exhibited higher concentrations of chlorophyll (60\% more), soluble protein (4 times more) and calcification rates (29\% more) than starved colonies. The net photosynthetic rate was higher in starved than in fed corals (18.53 +/- 6.99 and 6.78 +/- 2.06 mumol O-2 cm(-2) h(-1) respectively), whereas dark respiration was not significantly different (8.74 +/- 2.27 and 6.66 +/- 0.40 mumol O-2 cm(-2) h(-1)). The average delta(13)C value of Artemia sp. nauplii used for feeding was -12parts per thousand. delta(13)C was significantly heavier in zooxanthellae than in animal tissues, for both fed (-10.1 vs -11.7parts per thousand) and starved colonies (-10.9 vs -13.2parts per thousand.). Artemia sp. carbon was incorporated into the coral tissue as shown by the heavier delta(13)C in fed than in starved colonies (- 11.7 to -13.2parts per thousand, respectively), although there was no difference in the delta(13)C of the zooxanthellae fraction. Skeletal delta(13)C was similar in fed and starved colonies (mean -4.6parts per thousand). Skeletal delta(18)O composition was, however, significantly different between the 2 treatments (-4.24 to -4.05parts per thousand. for fed and starved colonies, respectively), which may have been due to differences in the calcification rates of fed and starved corals. These data are used to establish a conceptual model of the carbon flow between the various compartments of a symbiotic coral.

Here we experimentally change the zooxanthellae densities in branches of Stylophora pistillata corals through starvation and osmotic shock. We follow the subsequent changes of the zooxanthellae population dynamics. Prolonged starvation (40 days) caused a 50\% loss of zooxanthellae, a 70\% decrease in photosynthesis (P calculated per polyp), a 3-fold decrease in proliferating zooxanthellae frequency (PZF) and two-three-fold increase in degrading zooxanthellae frequency (DZF). The increase of the numbers of zooxanthellae in various stages of degradation was closely coupled to an increase in the release of degraded zooxanthellae particles (dzp). At the same time, zooxanthellae volume increased by 80\% but chlorophyll content and the photosynthetic capacity of the zooxanthellae did not change. Polyps subjected to osmotic shock (17 parts per thousand) expelled about one third of their zooxanthellae along with elements of animal cells. PZF and DZF levels varied slightly. We assume that zooxanthellae densities in corals are a consequence of differential rates of zooxanthellae division and degradation regulated by the coral host.

The compound-specific carbon isotope composition of the lipids was also measured. Under control conditions (26A degrees C), feeding with Artemia salina significantly increased the symbiont density and chlorophyll content and the growth rates of the corals. It also doubled the concentrations of almost all fatty acid (FA) compounds and increased the n-alcohol and sterol contents. delta C-13 results showed that the feeding enhancement of FA concentrations occurred either via a direct pathway, for one of the major polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) compounds of the food (18:3n-3 FA), or via an enhancement of photosynthate transfer (indirect pathway), for the other coral FAs. Cholesterol (C-27 Delta(5)) was also directly acquired from the food. Thermal stress (31A degrees C) affected corals, but differently according to their feeding status. Chlorophyll, protein content, and maximal photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) decreased to a greater extent in starved corals. In such corals, FA concentrations were reduced by 33\%, (especially C16, C18 FAs, and n-3 PUFA) and the sterol content by 27\% (especially the C(28)a dagger(5,22) and C(28)a dagger(5)). The enrichment in the delta C-13 signature of the storage and structural FAs suggests that they were the main compounds respired during the stress to maintain the coral metabolism. Thermal stress had less effect on the lipid concentrations of fed corals, as only FA levels were reduced by 13\%, with no major changes in their isotope carbon signatures. In conclusion, feeding plays an essential role in sustaining T. reniformis metabolism during the thermal stress.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"Ferrier-PagÃ¨s, C (Corresponding Author), Ctr Sci Monaco, Ave St Martin, MC-98000 Monaco, Monaco.

This gradient included `optimal', intermediate and marginal sites, where conditions were close to the survival threshold limit for corals. Coral communities changed across this gradient from diverse, mixed growth form assemblages to specialised, massive growth form dominated communities. The massive coral Goniastrea aspera was the only species identified at the most marginal and optimal sites. Branching species Acropora formosa and Porites cylindrica were only identified at optimal sites. The in hospite Symbiodinium community also changed across the environmental gradient from members of the Symbiodinium clade C on optimal reefs (in branching and massive species) to clade D on marginal reefs ( in massive species). Substantial variability in respiration and photosynthesis was observed in massive coral species under different environmental conditions, which suggests that all corals cannot be considered equal across environments. Studying present-day marginal environments is crucial to further understanding of future reef bio-diversity, functioning and accretion, and from work presented here, it is likely that as future climate change extends marginal reef range, branching coral diversity may decrease relative to massive, more resilient corals.

One hypothesized mechanism of coral bleaching involves the production of reduced oxygen intermediates, or toxic oxygen, in the dinoflagellate symbionts and]lost tissues that subsequently causes cellular damage and expulsion of symbionts. Measurements of photosynthesis in the Caribbean coral Agaricia tenuifolia, taken during temperature-induced stress and exposure to full solar radiation, showed a decrease in photosynthetic performance followed by bleaching. Exposure of corals to exogenous antioxidants that scavenge reactive oxygen species during temperature-induced stress improves maximum photosynthetic capacity to rates indistinguishable from corals measured at the ambient temperature of their site of collection. Additionally, these antioxidants prevent the coral from `'bleaching'' and affect the mechanism of symbiont loss from the coral host. These observations confirm a role for oxidative stress, whether caused by elevated temperatures or exposure to UV radiation, in the bleaching phenomenon.",SPRINGER VERLAG,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",English,"Lesser, MP (Corresponding Author), UNIV NEW HAMPSHIRE,DEPT ZOOL,DURHAM,NH 03824, USA.

During periods of elevated temperatures, however, they may provide a vital source of relief to heat-stressed corals. To assess the effect of LAIW on the thermal tolerance of the massive coral Porites lutea, we carried out a onemonth reciprocal LAIW simulation experiment with coral nubbins collected from the LAIW-exposed and LAIW-sheltered sides of the Similan Islands, an offshore archipelago near the Thai Andaman shelf break (distance of sampling locations <3 km). Corals from either origin were subjected to (1) ambient (29 degrees C, pH 839) vs. elevated (31.5 degrees C) temperatures; and (2) ambient temperatures with simulated LAIW (30 minute drops to 23.8 degrees C, pH 7.9, twice per day) vs. elevated temperatures with LAIW (30 minute drops to 24.9 degrees C, pH 7.9, twice per day). Simulated LAIW reduced heat stress responses in all corals. However, nubbins from the LAIW-exposed site showed a higher tolerance to the heat stress than sheltered corals, i.e. lower bleaching- and mortality rates, higher photosynthetic performances and higher protein contents at the end of the experiment, despite identical algal symbiont genotypes (ITS-2, C15). Our results suggest that LAIW-induced nutrient availability, enhanced heterotrophic feeding and thermal variability increased the upper thermal resistance of P. lutea, supporting the notion that LAIW-exposed reefs might be important refugia for coral survival in a warming ocean.

In this paper, I review recent research into the climate-induced breakdown of this important symbiosis (namely `coral bleaching') that challenges the validity of this long-standing belief. Indeed, I introduce a more parsimonious explanation, in which the coral host exerts a `controlled parasitism' over its algal symbionts that is akin to an enforced domestication arrangement. Far from being pathogenic, a range of well-established cellular processes are reviewed that support the role of the coral host as an active `farmer' of the energy-rich photoassimilates from its captive symbionts. Importantly, this new paradigm reposes the deleterious bleaching response in terms of an envelope of environmental conditions in which the exploitative and captive measures of the coral host are severely restricted.

Here, 11 dead Porites and 2 Porites with growth hiatuses growing in the 20th century were collected from the Nansha Islands, southern South China Sea (SCS) for monthly Sr/Ca, delta O-18 and delta C-13 analyses to explore the climatic conditions and metabolic information corresponding to these growth structures. Among the 13 episodes, the results showed that 8 mortalities occurred in the summers, coral MJ8 died in spring, and the other 2 mortalities and 2 growth hiatuses occurred in the cooling season. In addition to the dead surface of the coral mortalities, stress bands with significantly reduced growth rates could also be observed in the corals. Negative shifts in delta C-13 occurred prior to 5 coral mortalities and most stress bands were caused in summer, suggesting a sharp reduction in photosynthesis by decreased symbiotic zooxanthellae or photosynthetic pigments. Overall, the mortalities can be concluded to have occurred in summer and stress bands with abrupt delta C-13 decreases in the last century were mainly caused by thermal coral bleaching in the southern SCS. This in turn suggests that the repeated coral bleaching and mortalities occurred much earlier before the 1980s, which is a longer-term response to modern global warming during the last century.",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",English,"Yu, KF (Corresponding Author), Guangxi Univ, Coral Reef Res Ctr China, Sch Marine Sci, Guangxi Lab Study Coral Reefs South China Sea, Nanning 530004, Guangxi, Peoples R China.

These events are mainly caused by seawater warming, but are exacerbated by the subsequent decrease in nutrient availability in surface waters. It has therefore been shown that nitrogen, phosphorus or iron limitation contribute to the underlying conditions by which thermal stress induces coral bleaching. Generally, information on the trophic ecology of trace elements (micronutrients) in corals, and on how they modulate the coral response to thermal stress is lacking. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that heterotrophic feeding (i.e. the capture of zooplankton prey by the coral host) and thermal stress induce significant changes in micro element concentrations and isotopic signatures of the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata. The results obtained first reveal that coral symbionts are the major sink for the heterotrophically acquired micronutrients and accumulate manganese, magnesium and iron from the food. These metals are involved in photosynthesis and antioxidant protection. In addition, we show that fed corals can maintain high micronutrient concentrations in the host tissue during thermal stress and do not bleach, whereas unfed corals experience a significant decrease in copper, zinc, boron, calcium and magnesium in the host tissue and bleach. In addition, the significant increase in Cu-65 and Zn-66 signature of symbionts and host tissue at high temperature suggests that these isotopic compositions are good proxy for stress in corals. Overall, present findings highlight a new way in which coral heterotrophy and micronutrient availability contribute to coral resistance to global warming and bleaching.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Ferrier-PagÃ¨s, C (Corresponding Author), Ctr Sci Monaco, Monaco, Monaco.

From the perspective of energy supply, a decrease in symbiotic zooxanthellae density (ZD) during bleaching leads to a reduction in the amount of energy provided by photosynthesis to the coral host. However, there are still many unknowns about how corals maintain the stability of their energy supply when zooxanthellae decrease. In this study, 89 coral samples, including the relatively stress-tolerant massive Favia palauensis and Porites lutea and the relatively vulnerable branching Acropora millepora and Pocillopora damicornis, were collected from the Xisha Islands in the South China Sea in spring and summer 2020. The physiological parameters ZD, chl a, tissue biomass and lipid content were measured. The delta C-13 compositions of zooxanthellae and hosts were analyzed to explore the changes in trophic status in summer. Results show that the ZDs of A. millepora, P. damicornis, F. palauensis and P. lutea significantly decreased by 32, 29, 22 and 22\%, respectively, in summer. P. lutea and F. palauensis maintained metabolic energy requirements depending largely on heterotrophy. A. millepora and P. damicornis were more dependent on consuming their own lipids. Our study shows that there are intergeneric differences in the energy maintenance mechanisms used to cope with decreases in ZD. We suggest that the higher heterotrophic ability of F. palauensis and P. lutea renders their trophic status more plastic than that of A. millepora and P. damicornis. This characteristic may potentially affect their bleaching resilience.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",English,"Yu, KF (Corresponding Author), Guangxi Univ, Guangxi Lab Study Coral Reefs South China Sea, Coral Reef Res Ctr China, Sch Marine Sci, Nanning 530004, Peoples R China.

Although the onset of spatially extensive, or `mass', bleaching events can be predicted using simple temperature stress metrics, no models are available for predicting coral mortality risk or sub-lethal stress associated with bleaching. Here, we develop a model that links the functional response of colony energy balance and energy-store dynamics to coral mortality risk and recovery during and following bleaching events. In a series of simulations using response functions and parameter values derived from experimental studies for two Indo-Pacific coral species (Acropora intermedia and Montipora monasteriata), we demonstrate that prior energy-costly disturbances and alternative energy sources are both important determinants of coral mortality risk during and following bleaching. The timing of the onset of coral mass mortality is determined by a combination of bleaching severity (loss rate of photopigments), duration of the bleaching event, heterotrophy and the size of energy reserves (as lipid stores) before bleaching occurs. Depending on initial energy reserves, model results showed that high rates of heterotrophy could delay the onset of coral mortality by up to three weeks. Survival following bleaching was also strongly influenced by remaining lipid reserves, rates of heterotrophy, and rates of photopigment (or symbiont) recovery. Our results indicate that energy-costly disturbances and low availability of food, before and during bleaching events, respectively, work to increase bleaching-induced coral mortality risk for acroporid corals on Indo-Pacific reefs.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Anthony, KRN (Corresponding Author), Univ Queensland, Ctr Marine Studies, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.

Zooxanthellae within M. annularis and A. lamarki were found to be more sensitive to elevated temperature, virtually complete disruption of photosynthesis being noted during exposure to temperatures of 32 and 34 degrees C. The photosynthetic efficiency of zooxanthellae within S. radians and A. agaricites decreased to a lesser extent, Differences in the loss of algal cells on an aerial basis and in the cellular chlorophyll concentration were also found between these species. By combining the noninvasive PAM technique with whole-cell fluorescence of freshly isolated zooxanthellae, we have identified fundamental differences in the physiology of the symbionts within different species of coral. Zooxanthellae within M. annularis appear to be more susceptible to heat-induced damage at or near the reaction centre of Photosystem II, while zooxanthellae living in S. radians remain capable of dissipating excess excitation energy through non-photochemical pathways, thereby protecting the photosystem from damage during heat exposure.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Warner, ME (Corresponding Author), UNIV GEORGIA, INST ECOL, ATHENS, GA 30602 USA.

Here, we quantify the effects of long-term (95-day) thermal and CO2-acidification stress on photochemical efficiency of in hospite Symbiodinium within the coral Siderastrea siderea, along with corresponding coral color intensity, for corals from two reef zones (forereef, nearshore) on the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. We then explore the molecular responses of in hospite Symbiodinium to these stressors via genome-wide gene expression profiling. Elevated temperatures reduced symbiont photochemical efficiencies and were highly correlated with coral color loss. However, photochemical efficiencies of forereef symbionts were more negatively affected by thermal stress than nearshore symbionts, suggesting greater thermal tolerance and/or reduced photodamage in nearshore corals. At control temperatures, CO2-acidification had little effect on symbiont physiology, although forereef symbionts exhibited constitutively higher photochemical efficiencies than nearshore symbionts. Gene expression profiling revealed that S. siderea were dominated by Symbiodinium goreaui (C1), except under thermal stress, which caused shifts to thermotolerant Symbiodinium trenchii (D1a). Comparative transcriptomics of conserved genes across the host and symbiont revealed few differentially expressed S. goreaui genes when compared to S. siderea, highlighting the host's role in the coral's response to environmental stress. Although S. goreaui transcriptomes did not vary in response to acidification stress, their gene expression was strongly dependent on reef zone, with forereef S. goreaui exhibiting enrichment of genes associated with photosynthesis. This finding, coupled with constitutively higher forereef S. goreaui photochemical efficiencies, suggests that functional differences in genes associated with primary production exist between reef zones.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",English,"Davies, SW (Corresponding Author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Marine Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.

The last few years have seen the worst mass coral bleaching events recorded, with more than one quarter of all reefs irreversibly impacted. Considering the widespread devastation, we need to increase our efforts to understanding the physiological and metabolic shifts underlying the breakdown of this important symbiotic ecosystem. Here, we investigated the proteome (PRIDE accession \# PXD011668) of both host and symbionts of the reef-building coral Acropora millepora exposed to ambient (similar to 28 degrees C) and elevated temperature (similar to 32 degrees C for 2 days, following a five-day incremental increase) and explored associated biomolecular changes in the symbiont, with the aim of gaining new insights into the mechanisms underpinning the collapse of the coral symbiosis. We identified 1,230 unique proteins (774 host and 456 symbiont) in the control and thermally stressed corals, of which 107 significantly increased and 125 decreased in abundance under elevated temperature relative to the control. Proteins involved in oxidative stress and proteolysis constituted 29\% of the host proteins that increased in abundance, with evidence of impairment to endoplasmic reticulum and cytoskeletal regulation proteins. In the symbiont, we detected a decrease in proteins responsible for photosynthesis and energy production (33\% of proteins decreased in abundance), yet minimal signs of oxidative stress or proteolysis. Lipid stores increased > twofold despite reduction in photosynthesis, suggesting reduced translocation of carbon to the host. There were significant changes in proteins related to symbiotic state, including proteins linked to nitrogen metabolism in the host and the V-ATPase (-0.6 fold change) known to control symbiosome acidity. These results highlight key differences in host and symbiont proteomic adjustments under elevated temperature and identify two key proteins directly involved in bilateral nutrient exchange as potential indicators of symbiosis breakdown.",NATURE PORTFOLIO,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",English,"Petrou, K (Corresponding Author), Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Life Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.

Pulse-Amplitude Modulated (PAM) chlorophyll fluorescence techniques were used to examine changes in the maximum effective quantum yield (DeltaF/F-m') of symbiotic dinoflagellates within the host tissues (in hospite) of the coral Seriatopora hystrix exposed to a number of Photosystem 11 (PSII) inhibiting herbicides in short-term toxicity tests. The concentration of herbicide required to reduce DeltaF/F-m' by 50\% (median effective concentration {[}EC50]) differed by over 2 orders of magnitude: Irgarol 1051 (0.7 mug l(-1)) > ametryn (1.7 mug l(-1)) > diuron (2.3 mug l(-1)) > hexazinone (8.8 mug l(-1)) > atrazine (45 mug l(-1)) > simazine (150 mug l(-1)) > tebuthiuron (175 mug l(-1)) > ionynil (>1 mg l(-1)). Similar absolute and relative toxicities were observed with colonies of the coral Acropora formosa (Irgarol 1051 EC50: 1.3 mug l(-1), diuron EC50: 2.8 mug l(-1)). Time-course experiments indicated that DeltaF/F-m' was rapidly reduced (i.e. within minutes) in S. hystrix exposed to Irgarol 1051 and diuron. On return to fresh running seawater, DeltaF/F-m' recovered quickly in diuron-exposed corals (i.e. in minutes to hours), but slowly in corals exposed to Irgarol 1051 (i.e. hours to days). Time-course experiments indicated that the effects of diuron (3 mug l(-1)) on S. hystrix were inversely related to temperature over the range 20 to 30degreesC, although initially the effects were less at the lower temperatures. Repeated exposure to pulses of Irgarol 1051 (daily 2 h exposure to 30 mug l(-1) over 4 d) resulted in a 30\% decrease in the density of symbiotic dinoflagellates in the tissues of S. hystrix.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",English,"Jones, RJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Queensland, Ctr Marine Studies, St Lucia Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.

To improve our understanding of stable strontium isotope fractionation during the biomineralization process, correlations between monthly coral skeletal delta Sr-88 values and climatic and environmental variables (along with their corresponding geochemical proxies) between 2008 and 2009 were studied using a massive zooxanthellae Porites coral head from Sanya Bay on the south coast of Hainan Island in the northern South China Sea. Sea surface temperature and its corresponding geochemical proxies (Sr/Ca and delta O-18), pH and its proxy delta B-11, and precipitation (representing river runoff) show clear annual cycles, but their correlations with coral delta Sr-88 were not significant during 2008 and 2009. However, both total solar irradiance (TSI) and coral delta Sr-88 values followed a gradually increasing trend over the study period and showed a statistically significant correlation. These results indicate that the fractionation associated with coral skeleton delta Sr-88 is not temperature-dependent, but TSI may play a major role in controlling coral delta Sr-88 values at our study site. The underlying mechanism of TSI-induced Sr-88/Sr-86 fractionation in coral skeletons may be similar to that associated with coral delta C-13. That is, symbiotic zooxanthellae preferentially uptakes Sr-86 during photosynthesis leaving the internal strontium reservoirs enriched in Sr-88; consequently, increased uptake of Sr-88 by the coral skeleton occurs when photosynthetic rates increase. However, the correlation between coral delta Sr-88 and delta C-13 values may be masked by the carbon input from terrestrial river runoff and the kinetic isotope fractionation effect during the calcification process.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",English,"Deng, WF (Corresponding Author), Chinese Acad Sci, Guangzhou Inst Geochem, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China.

Growth of these injured nubbins was examined in parallel, and compared to controls. Biochemical compositions of the holobiont and the zooxanthellae density were determined at the onset of the experiment, and the photosynthetic efficiency (F-v/F-m) of zooxanthellae was monitored during the experiment. Acropora muricata rapidly regenerated small lesions, but regeneration rates significantly differed between sites. At the sheltered site characterized by high temperatures, temperature variations, and irradiance levels, regeneration took 192 days on average. At the exposed site, characterized by steadier temperatures and lower irradiation, nubbins demonstrated fast lesion repair (81 days), slower growth, lower zooxanthellae density, chlorophyll a concentration and lipid content than at the former site. A trade-off between growth and regeneration rates was evident here. High growth rates seem to impair regeneration capacity. We show that environmental conditions conducive to high zooxanthellae densities in corals are related to fast skeletal growth but also to reduced lesion regeneration rates. We hypothesize that a lowered regenerative capacity may be related to limited availability of energetic and cellular resources, consequences of coral holobionts operating at high levels of photosynthesis and associated growth.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",English,"Denis, V (Corresponding Author), Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Coral Lab, Taipei 115, Taiwan.

The symbiosis takes place in the presence of steep and dynamic gradients of light, temperature and chemical species that are affected by the structural and optical properties of the coral and their interaction with incident irradiance and water flow. Microenvironmental analyses have enabled quantification of such gradients and bulk coral tissue and skeleton optical properties, but the multi-layered nature of corals and its implications for the optical, thermal and chemical microenvironment remains to be studied in more detail. Here, we present a multiphysics modelling approach, where three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations of the light field in a simple coral slab morphology with multiple tissue layers were used as input for modelling the heat dissipation and photosynthetic oxygen production driven by photon absorption. By coupling photon, heat and mass transfer, the model predicts light, temperature and O-2 gradients in the coral tissue and skeleton, under environmental conditions simulating, for example, tissue contraction/expansion, symbiont loss via coral bleaching or different distributions of coral host pigments. The model reveals basic structure-function mechanisms that shape the microenvironment and ecophysiology of the coral symbiosis in response to environmental change.",ROYAL SOC,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",English,"Parkins, SKT (Corresponding Author), Delft Univ Technol, Dept Biotechnol, Maasweg 9, NL-2629 HZ Delft, Netherlands.

The symbiotic Red Sea coral Stylophora pistillata from the Gulf of Eilat is considered an opportunistic r' strategist. It can thrive in relatively unstable environments and is considered a stress-tolerant species. Here, we used a S. pistillata custom microarray to examine gene expression patterns and cellular pathways during short-term (13-day) heat stress. The results allowed us to identify a two-step reaction to heat stress, which intensified significantly as the temperature was raised to a 32 degrees C threshold, beyond which, coping strategies failed at 34 degrees C. We identified potential early warning genes' and severe heat-related genes'. Our findings suggest that during short-term heat stress, S. pistillata may divert cellular energy into mechanisms such as the ER-unfolded protein response (UPR) and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) at the expense of growth and biomineralization processes in an effort to survive and subsequently recover from the stress.

Previous studies suggest that both algal and microbial partners benefit coral hosts, but the nature of interactions between Symbiodiniaceae and prokaryotic microbes and their effects on coral hosts remains unclear. In the present study, we examined correlations between Symbiodiniaceae and prokaryotic microbes in Montipora spp. and Porites lutea sampled from two sites in Hong Kong with contrasting environmental conditions in March and October 2014. The results showed that the prokaryotic microbial communities had adaptable structures in both Montipora spp. and P. lutea, and environmental conditions had greater effects on the algal/microbial communities in Montipora spp. than in P. lutea. Further network analysis revealed a greater number of prokaryotic microbes were significantly correlated with potentially stress-resistant Symbiodiniaceae in P. lutea than in Montipora spp. Stress-resistant Symbiodiniaceae played more important roles in the community and in the algal-microbial correlations in P. lutea than in Montipora spp. Since P. lutea is faring better in Hong Kong as the seawater temperature gradually increases, the results suggest that the correlations between stress-resistant algae and prokaryotic microbes could provide a compensation mechanism allowing coral hosts to adapt to higher temperatures, particularly as the prokaryotic microbes correlated with Symbiodiniaceae provide the ecological functions of photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",English,"Qian, PY (Corresponding Author), Hong Kong Univ Sci \& Technol, Dept Ocean Sci, Div Life Sci, Southern Marine Sci \& Engn Guangdong Lab Guangzho, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

Here we tested the independent and combined impacts of climate change (current temperature and dissolved CO2, and 2 future climate scenarios) and a 1 mo long light attenuation period at 5 different light levels (0.1 to 4 mol photons m(-2) d(-1)) on early Acropora millepora recruits. Additionally, we evaluated whether the effects were age dependent by comparing responses of recruits that were 1 mo old ('early attenuation') vs. 2 mo old ('late attenuation'). Recruit survival, size and Symbiodiniaceae densities increased slightly under moderate future climate conditions (current temperature + 0.44 degrees C, 692 ppm pCO(2)), but decreased under a more severe climate scenario (+ 0.94 degrees C, 985 ppm pCO(2)). Light attenuation significantly decreased recruit survival, size and Symbiodiniaceae densities only for recruits exposed to the late attenuation, suggesting an increasing reliance on photosynthesis as recruits age. Under the more severe climate scenario tested, recruit survival was diminished by both climate change (<= 18 +/- 4\% {[}SE] in the early attenuation) and light limitation (<= 32 +/- 6\% in the late attenuation) compared with controls. However, there was no interaction between future climate scenarios and light attenuation, indicating that these effects were additive. This study demonstrates the potential effects of light limitation and future climate conditions on coral recruitment success and highlights the need to manage the timing of sediment-generating activities near reefs to optimise light availability for several months post settlement.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",English,"Brunner, CA (Corresponding Author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci \& Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.

Volcanic activity also results in extreme environmental changes at local to global scales, and may have significant impacts on coral reefs compared to other natural disturbances. During explosive eruptions, large amounts of volcanic ash are generated, significantly disrupting ecosystems close to a volcano, and depositing ash over distal areas (10s -1000s of km depending on i.a. eruption size and wind direction). Once volcanic ash interacts with seawater, the dissolution of metals leads to a rapid change in the geochemical properties of the seawater column. Here, we report the first known effects of volcanic ash on the physiology and elemental cycling of a symbiotic scleractinian coral under laboratory conditions. Nubbins of the branching coral Stylophora pistillata were reared in aquaria under controlled conditions (insolation, temperature, and pH), while environmental parameters, effective quantum yield, and skeletal growth rate were monitored. Half the aquaria were exposed to volcanic ash every other day for 6 weeks (250 mg L-1 week-1), which induced significant changes in the fluorescence-derived photochemical parameters (phi PSII, Fv/Fm, NPQ, rETR), directly enhanced the efficiency of symbiont photosynthesis (Pg, Pn), and lead to increased biomineralization rates. Enhancement of symbiont photosynthesis is induced by the supply of essential metals (Fe and Mn), derived from volcanic ash leaching in ambient seawater or within the organism following ingestion. The beneficial role of volcanic ash as an important micronutrient source is supported by the fact that neither photophysiological stress nor signs of lipid peroxi-dation were detected. Subaerial volcanism affects micronutrient cycling in the coral ecosystem, but the impli-cation for coral ecophysiology on a reef scale remains to be tested. Nevertheless, exposure to volcanic ash can improve coral health and thus influence resilience to external stressors.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",English,"FÃ¶rster, F (Corresponding Author), Univ Geneva, Dept Earth Sci, Geovolco Team, Geneva, Switzerland.

The enzymes nitrate reductase and NO synthase have been suggested to be involved in the production of NO in plants and algae, but the implication of those enzymes in NO production under physiological conditions remains obscure. Symbiodinium microadriaticum, commonly referred to as zooxanthellae, is a marine microalga commonly found in symbiotic association with a cnidarian host including reef-building corals. Here we demonstrate NO production in zooxanthellae upon supplementation of either sodium nitrite or L-arginine as a substrate. The nitrite-dependent NO production was detected electrochemically and confirmed by the application of 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO), a specific NO scavenger. Cells stained with the diaminofluorescein, DAF-2 DA, an NO fluorescent probe, showed an increase in fluorescence intensity upon supplementation of both sodium nitrite and L-arginine. Microscopic observations of DAF-stained cells verified that NO was produced inside the cells. NO production in S. microadriaticum was found to increase upon exposure of cells to an acute heat stress which also caused a decline in the photosynthetic efficiency of PSII (F-v/F-m). This study provides substantial evidence to confirm that zooxanthellae can synthesize NO even when they are not in a symbiotic association with a coral host. The increase in NO production at high temperatures suggests that heat stress stimulates the microalgal NO production in a temperature-dependent manner. The implications of these findings are discussed in the light of the coral bleaching phenomenon which is associated with elevated sea surface temperature due to global warming.",OXFORD UNIV PRESS,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",English,"Bouchard, JN (Corresponding Author), Univ Ryukyus, Okinawa 9030213, Japan.

The diel course of solar radiation is followed by photosynthesis rates and thereby elicits simultaneous changes in tissue oxygen tension due to the shift in photosynthesis/respiration balance. The recurrent patterns of sunlight are reflected in fluorescence yields, photosynthetic pigment content and activity of the two protective enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), enzymes that are among the universal defenses against free radical damage in living tissue. All of these were investigated in three scleractinian corals: Favia favus, Plerogyra sinuosa and Goniopora lobata. The activity of SOD and CAT in the animal host followed the course of solar radiation, increased with the rates of photosynthetic oxygen production and was correlated with a decrease in the maximum quantum yield of photochemistry in Photosystem H (PSII) (Delta F'/F-m'). SOD and CAT activity in the symbiotic algae also exhibited a light intensity correlated pattern, albeit a less pronounced one. The observed rise of the free-radical-scavenger enzymes, with a time scale of minutes to several hours, is an important protective mechanism for the existence and remarkable success of the unique cnidarian-dinoflagellate associations, in which photosynthetic oxygen production takes place within animal cells. This represents a facet of the precarious act of balancing the photosynthetic production of oxygen by the algal symbionts with their destructive action on all living cells, especially those of the animal host.",COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",English,"Levy, O (Corresponding Author), Univ Queensland, Ctr Marine Studies, Copper Rd,Gehrmann Bldg Bldg 60, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.

Extension rate and skeletal density were both correlated with calcification rate, indicating that calcium carbonate deposition was allocated evenly between skeletal density and linear extension. Unlike most studies on other tropical and temperate corals, in which calcification was positively correlated with solar radiation and SST, in the present study calcification was not correlated with solar radiation, whereas it was negatively correlated with SST. We hypothesize that photosynthesis of the symbiotic algae of Balanophyllia europaea is inhibited at high temperatures, consequently causing an inhibition of calcification. The regressions between calcification and SST predicted that the calcification of B. europaea would be depressed at 20.5-21.0 degrees C mean annual SST. The scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change conclude that by 2100, SST will exceed this physiological threshold for most of the populations considered in this study.

There is controversy over the mechanism behind this phenomenon, with hypotheses coarsely divided between abiotic and biologically-mediated mechanisms. At the same time, accumulating evidence shows that calcification in corals relies on active ion transport to deliver the skeleton building blocks into the calcifying medium, making it is an energetically costly activity. Here we build on generally accepted conceptual models of the coral calcification machinery and conceptual models of the energetics of coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis to develop a model that can be used to isolate the biologically-mediated and abiotic effects of photosynthesis, respiration, temperature, and seawater chemistry on coral calcification rates and related metabolic costs. We tested this model on data from the Mediterranean scleractinian Cladocora caespitosa, an acidification resistant species. We concluded that most of the variation in calcification rates due to photosynthesis, respiration and temperature can be attributed to biologically-mediated mechanisms, in particular to the ATP supplied to the active ion transports. Abiotic effects are also present but are of smaller magnitude. Instead, the decrease in calcification rates caused by acidification, albeit small, is sustained by both abiotic and biologically-mediated mechanisms. However, there is a substantial extra cost of calcification under acidified conditions. Based on these findings and on a literature review we suggest that the energy aspect of coral calcification might have been so far underappreciated.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",English,"Galli, G (Corresponding Author), Natl Inst Oceanog \& Expt Geophys OGS, Dept Oceanog OCE, Sgonico, Italy.

In this study, we examined the response of two contrasting phenotypes, termed winter and summer, of four Caribbean reef corals to similar light and heat-stress levels. The four species investigated were categorized into two groups: species with the ability to harbour large number of symbionts, Orbicella annularis and O. faveolata, and species with reduced symbiont density (Montastraea cavernosa and Pseudodiploria strigosa). The first group showed higher capacity to enhance photosynthetic rates per area (Pmax), while Pmax enhancement in the second group was more dependent on Symbiodinium performance (Psym). In summer all four species presented higher productivity, but also higher sensitivity to lose coral photosynthesis under heat-stress. In contrast, corals in winter exhibit symbionts with higher capacity to photoacclimate to the increased levels of light- stress elicited by heat-stress.

Symbiodinium photosynthetic efficiency (F (v) /F (m) ) was significantly depressed by the bleaching event, while elevated pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) slightly mitigated the effects of increased temperature on F (v) /F (m) during the final 4 d of the recovery period, however, did not affect the loss of symbionts. Elevated pCO(2) alone had no effect on F (v) /F (m) or symbiont density. Expression of targeted Symbiodinium genes involved in carbon metabolism and heat stress response was not significantly altered by either increased temperature and/or CO2. Of the selected host genes, two carbonic anhydrase isoforms (coCA2 and coCA3) exhibited the largest changes, most notably in crossed bleaching and elevated pCO(2) treatments. CA2 was significantly down-regulated on day 14 in all treatments, with the greatest decrease in the crossed treatment (relative expression compared to control = 0.16; p < 0.05); CA3 showed a similar trend, with expression levels 0.20-fold of controls on day 14 (p < 0.05) in the elevated temperature/pCO(2) treatment. The synergistic effects of ocean acidification and bleaching were evident during this study and demonstrate that increased pCO(2) in surface waters will impact corals much sooner than many studies utilising end-of-century pCO(2) concentrations would indicate.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"Leggat, W (Corresponding Author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.

Coral bleaching, the expulsion of endosymbionts from the coral host tissue as a consequence of heat or light stress, poses a threat to reef ecosystem functioning on a global scale. Hence, a better understanding of the factors contributing to heat stress susceptibility and tolerance is needed. In this regard, some of the most thermotolerant corals live in particularly saline habitats, but possible effects of high salinity on thermotolerance in corals are anecdotal. Here we test the hypothesis that high salinity may lead to increased thermotolerance. We conducted a heat stress experiment at low, intermediate, and high salinities using a set of hostendosymbiont combinations of the coral model Aiptasia. As expected, all host-endosymbiont combinations showed reduced photosynthetic efficiency and endosymbiont loss during heat stress, but the severity of bleaching was significantly reduced with increasing salinities for one of the host-endosymbiont combinations. Our results show that higher salinities can convey increased thermotolerance in Aiptasia, although this effect seems to be dependent on the particular host strain and/or associated symbiont type. This finding may help explain the extraordinarily high thermotolerance of corals in high salinity environments, such as the Red Sea and the Persian/Arabian Gulf, and provides novel insight regarding factors that contribute to thermotolerance. Since our results are based on a salinity effect in symbiotic sea anemones, it remains to be determined whether this salinity effect can also be observed in stony corals.",COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",English,"Voolstra, CR (Corresponding Author), KAUST, Red Sea Res Ctr, Div Biol \& Environm Sci \& Engn BESE, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia.

Transcriptome analysis showed that heat-stressed corals corresponded to metabolic depression and catabolism of amino acids in both hosts which might promote their survival. However, only M. peltiformis has developed the bleached coral phenotype with corresponding strong stress- and immune-related responses in the host and symbiont, and strong suppression of photosynthesis-related genes in the symbiont.

CO2 enrichment did not confer enhanced thermal tolerance as had been suggested in other studies. A. cervicornis was more sensitive to heat stress (maximum monthly mean + 1.5 degrees C) experiencing 100\% mortality after 25 d while all O. faveolata survived. Conversely, O. faveolata was more sensitive to high CO2 experiencing a 47\% reduction in growth while A. cervicornis experienced no significant reduction.

It has been suggested that large-scale bleaching episodes are linked to global warming. The data presented here demonstrate that Vibrio coralliilyticus is an etiological agent of bleaching of the coral Pocillopora damicornis. This bacterium was present at high levels in bleached P. damicornis but absent from healthy corals. The bacterium was isolated in pure culture, characterized microbiologically, and shown to cause bleaching when it was inoculated onto healthy corals at 25degreesC. The pathogen was reisolated from the diseased tissues of the infected corals. The zooxanthella concentration in the bacterium-bleached corals was less than 12\% of the zooxanthella concentration in healthy corals. When P. damicornis was infected with V. coralliidyticus at higher temperatures (27 and 29degreesC), the corals lysed within 2 weeks, indicating that the seawater temperature is a critical environmental parameter in determining the outcome of infection. A large increase in the level of the extracellular protease activity of V. coralliilyticus occurred at the same temperature range (24 to 28degreesC) as the transition from bleaching to lysis of the corals. We suggest that bleaching of P. damicornis results from an attack on the algae, whereas bacterium-induced lysis and death are promoted by bacterial extracellular proteases.

We present a numerical model of this mechanism of photoinhibition for symbiotic algae residing within coral tissue. The resulting rate of bleaching depended on temperature, light intensity, and the rate of heterotrophic feeding. The model was validated using three independently published experimental data sets. The model was capable of capturing both the diurnal change in the state of the photosystem, as well as changes in the symbiont population and the coral host caused by different temperature, light, and feeding treatments. Elevated temperatures and light led to a degradation of the photosystem and the expulsion of symbiont cells. If the coral fed heterotrophically, this degradation of the photosynthetic apparatus was reduced, but still a clear decrease in maximum quantum yield (F-v : F-m) and cell numbers was observed when the coral was exposed to elevated temperature. The reduction in chlorophyll content of cells at elevated temperatures and light was compared with the observational bleaching index Degree Heating Days (DHD). As quantified by DHD, the model was found to bleach under similar thermal stress regimes as field studies, except under elevated heterotrophic feeding conditions, which resulted in reduced severity of bleaching over a 90 d period.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Gustafsson, MSM (Corresponding Author), Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Sci, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.

For symbiotic reef corals, daily cycles of light and periods of intense cloud cover can be chronic causes of food limitation through reduced photosynthesis. Furthermore, coral bleaching is common in present-day reefs, creating a context in which metabolic depression could have beneficial value to corals. In the present study, corals (massive Porites spp.) were exposed to an extreme case of resource limitation by starving them of food and light for 20 days. When resources were limited, the corals depressed area-normalized respiration to 37\% of initial rates, and coral biomass declined to 64\% of initial amounts, yet the corals continued to produce skeletal mass. However, the declines in biomass cannot account for the declines in area-normalized respiration, as mass-specific respiration declined to 30\% of the first recorded time point. Thus, these corals appear to be capable of metabolic depression. It is possible that some coral species are better able to depress metabolic rates than others; such variation could explain differential survival during conditions that limit resources (e.g. shading). Furthermore, we found that maintenance of existing biomass, in part, supports the production of skeletal mass. This association could be explained if maintenance supplies needed energy (e.g. ATP) or inorganic carbon (i.e. CO2) that otherwise limits the production of skeletal mass. Finally, the observed metabolic depression can be explained as a change in pool sizes, and does not require a change in metabolic rules.",COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",English,"Jacobson, LM (Corresponding Author), Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA.

Coral bleaching is the disruption of the symbiotic association between coral hosts and their photosynthetic microalgae zooxanthellae. This is either due to lowered resistance in corals to infection or increased virulence of the bacterium at the higher sea surface temperature. The concentration of the oxygen and resulting oxygen radicals produced by the zooxanthellae during photosynthesis are highly toxic to bacteria, which also assist corals in resisting the infection. Hence, in this study we examined the effect of different temperatures on the activity of a novel extracellular SOD in V. shiloi. We also partially characterized the SOD and clearly confirmed that the extracellular SOD produced by V. shiloi is Mn-SOD type, as it was not inhibited by H2O2 or KCN. Performing chemical susceptibility killing assay, we confirmed that extracellular SOD may act as first line of defense for the bacteria against the reactive oxygen species. Since, increased activity of novel Mn-SOD at higher temperature, leads to the neutralization of radical toxicity and facilitates the survival of V. shiloi.

Small branches were incubated in different concentrations of fluoranthene followed by exposure to ecologically relevant levels of natural solar radiation, with and without UVR. Exposure to the highest concentration of fluoranthene (60 mu g L-1) resulted in decreased photochemical efficiency of corals exposed concomitantly to UVR but not in corals exposed to 60 mu g L-1 fluoranthene without UVR. After 6 days, most coral samples that were exposed to fluoranthene and UVR bleached or died (78\%) on the upper side of the branches. At 60 mu g L-1 fluoranthene with UVR, 11 out of 12 samples died and the remaining sample bleached, much greater than the number of samples that bleached in manipulation or solvent controls. On the under side of the same samples, where the coral polyps are naturally protected from UVR, 11 out of 12 samples remained healthy and intact.

Using a review of published studies and an experimental analysis, we confirm the large species-specific component of the OA response, which predicts moderate impacts on coral physiology and pigmentation by 2100 (scenario-B1 or SSP2-4.5), in contrast with the severe disturbances induced by only +2 \& DEG;C of thermal anomaly. Accordingly, global warming represents a greater threat for coral calcification than OA. The incomplete understanding of the moderate OA response relies on insufficient attention to key regulatory processes of these symbioses, particularly the metabolic dependence of coral calcification on algal photosynthesis and host respiration.

However, little has been documented on its effects on the behavior and recruitment of coral larvae, which sustains coral reef ecosystems. Here, we analyzed physiological changes in larvae of the scleractinian coral Pocillopora damicornis and examined the photophysiological performance of the symbiont algae, following exposure to incident levels of UVR and subsequently observed the development of coral larvae. The endosymbiotic algae exhibited a high sensitivity to UV-B (295-320nm) during a 6h exposure, showing lowered photosynthetic performance per larva and per algal cell, whereas the presence of UV-A (320-395nm) significantly stimulated photosynthesis. UVR decreased chlorophyll a concentration only at higher surface temperature or at the higher doses or intensities of UVR. Correlations between UV-absorbing compound (UVAC) contents or UVR sensitivity and temperature were identified, implying that UVACs might act as a screen or antioxidants in Pocillopora damicornis larvae.

Coral bleaching events of unprecedented frequency and global extent have been reported during the last two decades. Recently, we demonstrated that bleaching of the coral Oculina patagonica in the Mediterranean Sea is caused by the bacterium Vibrio shiloi, when seawater temperature rises and allows the bacterium to become virulent. The first step in the infection process is host-specific adhesion of V. shiloi to O. patagonica via a beta-galactoside receptor on the coral surface. The bacterium then penetrates into the coral tissue and produces extracellular materials which rapidly inhibit photosynthesis of zooxanthellae and bleach and lyse the algae. The inhibition of pothosynthesis is due to a low molecular weight, heat stable toxin and ammonia. Bleaching and lysis are due to a heat-labile, high molecular weight materials, probably lytic enzymes. Elevated temperature induces different virulence factors within the infectious agent of the disease, V. shiloi. Adhesion was found to be temperature-regulated. When the bacteria were grown at 16 degrees C there was no adhesion to corals maintained at either 25 degrees C or 16 degrees. However, when the bacteria were grown at 25 degrees C they adhered avidly to corals maintained at 16 degrees C and 25 degrees C. In addition, the production of lytic enzymes and the photosynthesis inhibitor was also found to be temperature dependent. Production of the latter toxin was ten times greater at 29 degrees C than at 16 degrees C, and extracellular protease was 5-fold higher in cultures grown at 29 degrees C than at 16 degrees C.

However, increased sea temperatures cause algal loss-known as coral bleaching-often followed by coral death. Some of the most compelling evidence in support of the `oxidative stress theory of coral bleaching' comes from studies that exposed corals, cultures of their algal endosymbionts, or the coral model Exaiptasia diaphana to exogenous antioxidants during thermal stress. Here, we replicate these experiments using E.diaphana with the addition of the antioxidants ascorbate + catalase, catechin, or mannitol under ambient and elevated temperatures along with an antioxidant-free control. In the absence of exogenous antioxidants, E.diaphana exposed to elevated temperatures bleached with no change in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels associated with their microalgal cells. Ascorbate + catalase and mannitol treatments rescued the anemones from bleaching, although microalgal ROS levels increased in these antioxidant treatments under elevated temperature conditions. While bleaching was not associated with changes in net ROS for the intracellular algal symbionts, it is evident from our findings that excess ROS is connected to the bleaching phenotype as exogenous antioxidants were successful in mitigating the effects of thermal stress in cnidarians.

However, the accuracy of paleoSSTs derived from fossil coral Sr/Ca is challenged by evidence that physiological processes influence skeletal chemistry. Here we show that water level variations from tidal forcing are correlated with changes in coral Sr/Ca that cannot be accounted for by changes in SST. Ion microprobe measurements of Sr/Ca ratios in a Pacific Porites lutea reveal high-frequency variations at periods of similar to6, similar to10, and similar to25 days. The relationship between Sr/Ca and temperature on these short timescales does not follow trends observed at longer periods, indicating that an additional forcing is required to explain our observations. We demonstrate that Sr/Ca is correlated with both tidal water level variations and SST, and that their contributions to the Sr/Ca content of the skeleton vary as a function of period.

Surprisingly, we found little indication for regional adaptation, but strong indications for high phenotypic plasticity: Calcification rates in two seasons (winter, summer) were found to be highest at 28-29 degrees C throughout all populations independent of their geographic location. Mucus release increased with temperature and nutrient supply, both being highest in the south. Genetic characterization of the coral host revealed low inter-regional variation and differences in the Symbiodinium clade composition only at the most northern and most southern region. This suggests variable acclimatization potential to ocean warming of coral populations across the Red Sea: high acclimatization potential in northern populations, but limited ability to cope with ocean warming in southern populations already existing at the upper thermal margin for corals.",NATURE RESEARCH,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",English,"Sawall, Y (Corresponding Author), Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res GEOMAR, Wischhofstr 1-3, D-24148 Kiel, Germany.

Aragonite was randomly sampled, and the oxygen isotopic composition (delta O-18) was analyzed at the micrometer scale. Measurements were collected from six cultured colonies using a factorial design of three temperatures (22 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 28 degrees C) and two light intensities (200 and 400 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1)). Observation of the newly formed skeletons revealed fibrous morphology. The delta O-18 distribution following a bin width of 0.25\% in histograms was bimodal. Because the colonies were cultured under constant environmental conditions, we suggest this bimodality in isotope distribution was caused by the diurnal cycle of 12 h light and 12 h dark that is necessary for coral health and to mimic natural conditions. We assume that the two modal values correspond to the two fractionation end members present in daytime and nighttime fibers. Then, we investigated the precipitation mechanism for each. In contrast to a common assumption, that the two fractionations are due to differences in pH created by more or less efficient Ca2+ pumping, we demonstrate that the pH at the calcification site cannot explain the isotopic discrepancy between daytime and nighttime and conclude that aragonite precipitation does not obey classical thermodynamic rules. We suggest that secretion of proteins by the calicoblastic layer, different following the diurnal cycle, can induce distinct biological kinetic processes.

Coral thermal tolerance is partly dependent on the Symbiodinium hosted. Therefore, directed laboratory evolution in Symbiodinium has been proposed as a strategy to enhance coral holobiont thermal tolerance. Using a reciprocal transplant design, we show that the upper temperature tolerance and temperature tolerance range of Symbiodinium C1 increased after similar to 80 asexual generations (2.5 years) of laboratory thermal selection. Relative to wild-type cells, selected cells showed superior photophysiological performance and growth rate at 31 degrees C invitro, and performed no worse at 27 degrees C; they also had lower levels of extracellular reactive oxygen species (exROS). In contrast, wild-type cells were unable to photosynthesise or grow at 31 degrees C and produced up to 17 times more exROS. In symbiosis, the increased thermal tolerance acquired ex hospite was less apparent. In recruits of two of three species tested, those harbouring selected cells showed no difference in growth between the 27 and 31 degrees C treatments, and a trend of positive growth at both temperatures. Recruits that were inoculated with wild-type cells, however, showed a significant difference in growth rates between the 27 and 31 degrees C treatments, with a negative growth trend at 31 degrees C. There were no significant differences in the rate and severity of bleaching in coral recruits harbouring wild-type or selected cells. Our findings highlight the need for additional Symbiodinium genotypes to be tested with this assisted evolution approach. Deciphering the genetic basis of enhanced thermal tolerance in Symbiodinium and the cause behind its limited transference to the coral holobiont in this genotype of Symbiodinium C1 are important next steps for developing methods that aim to increase coral bleaching tolerance.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Chakravarti, LJ (Corresponding Author), Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia.

Feeding is known to alter coral physiology and increase resilience to bleaching. The goal of the study was to address the knowledge gap of the influence of feeding on reproductive output and offspring phenotype. Colonies of Stylophora pistillata from the Northern Gulf of Aqaba (Red Sea) were fed an Artemia diet or unfed for 5 months during gametogenesis, fertilization, and brooding. In addition, time to settlement and mortality of planulae were assessed at water temperatures ranging from winter temperature (22 degrees C) to three degrees above average peak summer temperature (31 degrees C). A range of physiological parameters was measured in parents and offspring. In brooding parents, feeding significantly increased protein concentration and more than tripled the number of released planulae. Planulae from unfed colonies had higher chlorophyll per symbiont concentration and concomitantly higher photosynthetic efficiency compared to planulae from fed parents. In settlement assays, planulae showed a similar thermal resistance as known for this Red Sea adult population. Mortality was greater in planulae from unfed parents at ambient and 3 degrees C above ambient temperature despite higher per offspring investment in terms of total fatty acid content. Fatty acid profiles and relative abundances were generally conserved between different fed and unfed colonies but planulae were enriched in monounsaturated fatty acids relative to adults, that is, 16:1, 18:1, 20:1, 22:1, and 24:1 isomers.

While this mutualistic relationship is impacted by numerous stressors, warming oceans are a predominant threat to coral reefs, placing the future of the world's reefs in peril. Some Symbiodiniaceae species exhibit tolerance to thermal stress, but the in hospite symbiont response to thermal stress is underexplored. To describe the underpinnings of symbiosis and heat stress response, we compared in hospite and free-living transcriptomes of Durusdinium trenchii, a pan-tropical heat-tolerant Symbiodiniaceae species, under stable temperature conditions and acute hyperthermal stress. We discovered that symbiotic state was a larger driver of the transcriptional landscape than heat stress. The majority of differentially expressed transcripts between in hospite and free-living cells were downregulated, suggesting the in hospite condition is associated with the shutdown of numerous processes uniquely required for a free-living lifestyle. In the free-living state, we identified enrichment for numerous cell signalling pathways and other functions related to detecting and responding to a changing environment, as well as transcripts relating to mitosis, meiosis, and motility. In contrast, in hospite cells exhibited enhanced transcriptional activity for photosynthesis and carbohydrate transport as well as chromatin modifications and a disrupted circadian clock. Hyperthermal stress induced drastic alteration of transcriptional activity in hospite, suggesting symbiotic engagement with the host elicited an exacerbated stress response when compared to free-living D. trenchii. Altogether, the dramatic differences in gene expression between in hospite and free-living D. trenchii indicate the importance of considering symbiotic state in investigations of symbiosis and hyperthermal stress in Symbiodiniaceae.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Rodriguez-Lanetty, M (Corresponding Author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA.

Environmental impact of the desalination plant discharge is supposedly site- and volumetric- specific, and also depends on the salinity tolerance of the organisms inhabiting the water column in and around a discharge environment. Scientific studies that aim to understand possible impacts of elevated salinity levels are important to assess detrimental effects to organisms, especially for species with no mechanism of osmoregulation, e.g., presumably corals. Previous studies on corals indicate sensitivity toward hypo- and hyper-saline environments with small changes in salinity already affecting coral physiology. In order to evaluate sensitivity of Red Sea corals to increased salinity levels, we conducted a long-term (29 days) in situ salinity tolerance transect study at an offshore seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) discharge on the coral Fungia granulosa. While we measured a pronounced increase in salinity and temperature at the direct outlet of the discharge structure, effects were indistinguishable from the surrounding environment at a distance of 5 m. Interestingly, corals were not affected by varying salinity levels as indicated by measurements of the photosynthetic efficiency. Similarly, cultured coral symbionts of the genus Symbiodinium displayed remarkable tolerance levels in regard to hypo- and hypersaline treatments. Our data suggest that increased salinity and temperature levels from discharge outlets wear off quickly in the surrounding environment. Furthermore, F. granulosa seem to tolerate levels of salinity that are distinctively higher than reported for other corals previously. It remains to be determined whether Red Sea corals in general display increased salinity tolerance, and whether this is related to prevailing levels of high(er) salinity in the Red Sea in comparison to other oceans.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",English,"van der Merwe, R (Corresponding Author), King Abdullah Univ Sci \& Technol, Marine Monitoring \& Environm Management, Red Sea Res Ctr, Bldg 2,Level 2, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia. van der Merwe, Riaan; Lattemann, Sabine; Amy, Gary L., King Abdullah Univ Sci \& Technol, Biol \& Environm Sci \& Engn Div, Water Desalinat \& Reuse Ctr, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.

The internal pathways that deliver Ci for both photosynthesis and calcification are known to involve the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA), which interconverts CO2 and HCO3-. We have developed a method for absolute quantification of internal CA (iCA) activity in coral tissue based on the rate of O-18-removal from labeled Ci. The method was applied to three Caribbean corals (Orbicella faveolata, Porites astreoides and Siderastrea radians) and showed that these species have similar iCA activities per unit surface area, but that S. radians has similar to 10-fold higher iCA activity per unit tissue volume. A model of coral Ci processing shows that the measured iCA activity is sufficient to support the proposed roles for iCA in Ci transport for photosynthesis and calcification. This is the case even when iCA activity is homogeneously distributed throughout the coral, but the model indicates that it would be advantageous to concentrate iCA in the spaces where calcification (the calcifying fluid) and photosynthesis (the oral endoderm) take place. We argue that because the rates of photosynthesis and calcification per unit surface area are similar among the corals studied here, the areal iCA activity used to deliver Ci for these reactions should also be similar. The elevated iCA activity per unit volume of S. radians compared with that of the other species is probably due to the thinner effective tissue thickness in this species.",COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",English,"Hopkinson, BM (Corresponding Author), Univ Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA.

Amongst these is their apparent capacity to tolerate higher than normal water temperatures. There is strong photokinetic evidence that the trait of heat-tolerance in plants is accompanied by energetic tradeoffs but little such evidence yet exists for corals. We use rapid light curves (RLCs) to investigate the photokinetic basis for thermo-tolerance in the reef coral Acropora millepora with symbionts of contrasting thermal tolerance for which there are measured differences in energetics. Our results show that under non-stressful temperatures, corals with heat-tolerant type D Symbiodinium had a 41\% lower maximum relative electron transport rate (rETRmax) and lower light absorption efficiency (alpha) due to lower cell Chl a content compared with corals with heat-sensitive type C2 symbionts. Our results provide support for a photokinetic link between heat tolerance and deficits in holobiont (coral + symbiont) growth, lipid stores and reproduction. Reduced electron transport rate and light absorption capacity may be genotype-specific attributes that enable clade D symbionts and their cnidarian hosts to cope with temperature stress but they inherently influence the photosynthetic function of the symbionts and thus have negative downstream effects on the coral.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Jones, A (Corresponding Author), Cent Queensland Univ, Bldg 6,Bruce Highway, Rockhampton, Qld 4701, Australia.

Corals were grown in sand-filtered seawater and not fed; thus, they subsisted from photosynthesis of symbiotic algae. As the daily dose of photosynthetically active radiation increased, the rate of annual extension also increased. Mean isotope compositions shifted; the carbon isotope compositions (delta C-13) became heavier and the oxygen isotope compositions ( delta O-18) became lighter at higher radiation dose. Skeletal delta O-18 decrease coincided with increasing skeletal growth rate, indicating the influence of so-called kinetic isotope effects. The observed delta C-13 increase should be subject to both kinetic and metabolic isotope effects, with the latter reflecting skeletal delta C-13 enrichment due to photosynthesis by symbiotic algae. Using a vector approach in the delta C-13 - delta O-18 plane, we discriminated between kinetic and metabolic isotope effects on delta C-13. The calculated delta C-13 changes from metabolic isotope effects were light dose dependent. The delta C-13 fractionation curve related to metabolic isotope effects is very similar to the photosynthesis - irradiance curve, indicating the direct contribution of photosynthetic activity to metabolic isotope effects. In contrast, delta C-13 fractionation related to kinetic isotope effects gradually increased as the growth rate increased. Our experiment demonstrated that the kinetic and metabolic isotope effects in coral skeleton were successfully differentiated.",AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",English,"Omata, T (Corresponding Author), Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci \& Technol, Res Program Marine Biol \& Ecol, 2-15 Natsushimacho, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan.

Coral calcification, a process that is critical to build and maintain the structure of tropical coral reefs, is highly sensitive to both warming and acidifying oceans. However, in contrast to the impacts of OA on coral calcification, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding how coral biomineralization mechanisms are impacted by heat stress and bleaching. Using a combined physiological and geochemical approach, we investigated how a marine heatwave impacted coral symbiotic status (chlorophyll a, algal symbiont density), the carbonate chemistry of the coral calcifying fluid (via delta B-11 and B/Ca) and skeletal trace element composition in the branching coral Acropora aspera. Importantly, we recorded in situ temperature throughout the bleaching event and recovery as well as coral symbiotic status during peak bleaching and after 7 months of recovery. We show that heat-stressed Acropora corals continued to upregulate the pH of their calcifying fluid (cf); however, dissolved inorganic carbon upregulation inside the cf was significantly disrupted by heat stress. Similarly, we observed suppression of the typical seasonality in the trace element (TE) temperature proxies Sr/Ca, Mg/Ca, Li/Ca and Li/Mg, indicating disruption of important calcification mechanisms, Rayleigh fractionation and reduced growth rates. Anomalies in TE/Ca ratios were still observed 7 months after peak bleaching, even though algal symbiont densities and chlorophyll a concentrations were fully restored at this point. Interestingly, the biomineralization response to heat stress did not differ between thermally distinct reef habitats harbouring coral populations with different heat tolerance, nor between heat-stressed colonies with different severity of bleaching. Our findings suggest that coral biomineralization mechanisms in Acropora are highly sensitive to heat stress, showing similar patterns of biogeochemical stress response as other coral taxa.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"Schoepf, V (Corresponding Author), Univ Western Australia, Oceans Grad Sch, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA, Australia.

Occasionally, bleached corals become exceptionally colorful rather than white. These colors derive from photoprotective green fluorescent protein (GFP)-like pigments produced by the coral host. There is currently no consensus regarding what causes colorful bleaching events and what the consequences for the corals are. Here, we document that colorful bleaching events are a recurring phenomenon in reef regions around the globe. Our analysis of temperature conditions associated with colorful bleaching events suggests that corals develop extreme coloration within 2 to 3 weeks after exposure to mild or temporary heat stress. We demonstrate that the increase of light fluxes in symbiontdepleted tissue promoted by reflection of the incident light from the coral skeleton induces strong expression of the photoprotective coral host pigments. We describe an optical feedback loop involving both partners of the association, discussing that themitigation of light stress offered by host pigments could facilitate recolonization of bleached tissue by symbionts. Our data indicate that colorful bleaching has the potential to identify local environmental factors, such as nutrient stress, that can exacerbate the impact of elevated temperatures on corals, to indicate the severity of heat stress experienced by corals and to gauge their post-stress recovery potential.",CELL PRESS,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",English,"Wiedenmann, J (Corresponding Author), Univ Southampton, Coral Reef Lab, Waterfront Campus,European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.

We investigated during 7 d the photosynthetic behaviour of symbionts of coral reef and temperate foraminifers in hospite, by means of the JIP-test. By this screening test the fast fluorescence rise O-J-I-P, measured by a Plant Efficiency Analyser (PEA) with 10 mu s time resolution and 12 bit signal resolution, was analysed. II informs about the structure and function of photosystem 2 being at different physiological states established by adaptation to different irradiance and temperature. The test needs a measuring time in vivo of only 1 to 5 s, and thus many samples can be analysed. The measurements can be done continuously even on a single cell in a test tube or on the reef. The reef foraminifers tested here were Amphistegina and Amphisorus, freshly collected in Mauritius. As a temperate foraminifer, Sorites from the Mediterranean Sea was tested. The cells are very sensitive to slight temperature changes (25 to 32 degrees C). The comparison showed that the more the foraminifers live in an environment with constant temperature the less they are able to respond to temperature changes and, thus, the less they can adapt. Rising the temperature increases in general the sensitivity to different stress factors, such as high irradiance, pH, CO2, etc. After the test series, the cells recovered fully and were kept in an aquarium for long time observation.","INST EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY, ACAD SCI CZECH REPUBLIC","NA KARLOVCE 1A, PRAGUE 6 CS-160 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",English,"Strasser, RJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Geneva, Bioenerget Lab, CH-1254 Geneva, Switzerland.

In this context, the role of ROS in the stress response that leads to coral bleaching was investigated in three series of experiments with octocorals Sarcothelia sp. and Sympodium sp. Using video and fluorescent microscopy, the first experiments examined ROS and symbiont migration. Colonies mildly stressed with increased temperature and light showed increases in both ROS and numbers of migrating symbionts compared with stress-free controls. Symbionts migrating in the gastrovascular lumen may escape programmed cell death and provide a reservoir of healthy symbionts once conditions return to normal. In the second series of experiments, colonies were mildly stressed with elevated temperature and light. During stress, treated colonies were incubated in seawater enriched with two concentrations of bicarbonate (1 and 3 mmol/L), while controls were incubated in normal seawater. Bicarbonate enrichment provides additional carbon for photosynthesis and at some concentrations diminished the ROS emissions of stressed colonies of Sympodium sp. and Sarcothelia sp. In all experiments, the latter species tended to exhibit more ROS. Sympodium sp. contains Cladocopium sp. symbionts, which are less tolerant of stress, while Sarcothelia sp. contains the more resistant Durusdinium sp. Indeed, in direct comparisons, Sarcothelia sp. experienced higher levels of ROS under stress-free conditions and thus is conditioned to endure the stress associated with bleaching. Generally, ROS levels provide important insight into the cnidarian stress response and should be measured more often in studies of this response.",UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",English,"Blackstone, NW (Corresponding Author), Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Biol Sci, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA.

We individually compared the data recorded at low light (LL) and high light (HL) for 24 colonies, all derived from the same parent colony. Metabolic and isotopic responses to the different light levels were highly variable. High light led to productivity enhancement, reduction of surface extension, doubling of aragonite deposited weight and increased delta O-18 levels in all nubbins; responses in respiration and delta C-13 were not clear. The partitioning of the colonies cultured at HL into two groups, one showing a delta C-13 enrichment and the other a delta C-13 decrease revealed common behaviors. Samples showing an increase in delta C-13 were associated with the co-variation of low surface extension and high productivity while samples showing a decrease in delta C-13 were associated with the co-variation of higher surface extension and limited productivity. This experiment, which allowed for the separation of temperature and light effects on the coral, highlighted the significant light influences on both skeletal delta O-18 and delta C-13. The high scattering of inter-colony delta O-18 observed at one site could be due to the differing photosynthetic responses of symbiotic algal assemblages. We compared our results with observations by Gladfelter on Acropora cervicornis (1982). Both set of results highlight the relationships between coral-growth rates, micro-structures and photosynthetic activity. It appears that extension growth and skeleton thickening are two separate growth modes, and thickening is light-enhanced while extension is light-suppressed.

We observe significant variations in B/Ca, Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and delta B-11 over short skeletal distances (nominally equivalent to periods of <20 days). This heterogeneity probably reflects variations in the composition of the extracellular calcifying fluid (ECF) from which the skeleton precipitates. Calcification site pH (total scale) was estimated from skeletal delta B-11 and ranged from 8.3 to 8.8 (+/- similar to 0.1) with a mean of similar to 8.6. Sr/Ca and B/Ca heterogeneity is not simply correlated with calcification site pH, as might be expected if Ca-ATPase activity increases the pH and decreases the Sr/Ca and B(OH)(4)(-)/CO32- ratios of the ECF. We produced a simple model of the ECF composition and the skeleton deposited from it, over a range of calcium transport and carbonate scenarios, which can account for these observed geochemical variations. The relationship between the pH and Sr/Ca of the ECF is dependent on the concentration of DIC at the calcification site. At higher DIC concentrations the ECF has a high capacity to buffer the [}H+] changes induced by Ca-ATPase pumping. Conversely, at low DIC concentrations, this buffering capacity is reduced and ECF pH changes more rapidly in response to Ca-ATPase pumping. The absence of a simple correlation between ECF pH and skeletal Sr/Ca implies that calcification occurred under a range of DIC concentrations, reflecting variations in the respiration and photosynthesis of the coral and symbiotic zooxanthellate in the overlying coral tissues. Our observations have important implications for the use of coral skeletons as indicators of palaeo-occan pH. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Coral calcification rates, estimated from buoyant weights, were not significantly affected by moderately elevated nutrients at ambient CO2 and were negatively affected by elevated CO2 at ambient nutrient levels. However, calcification by corals reared under elevated nutrients combined with elevated CO2 was not significantly different from that of corals reared under ambient conditions, suggesting that CO2 enrichment can lead to nutrient limitation in zooxanthellate corals. A conceptual model is proposed to explain how nutrients and CO2 interact to control zooxanthellate coral calcification. Nutrient limited corals are unable to utilize an increase in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) as nutrients are already limiting growth, thus the effect of elevated CO2 on saturation state drives the calcification response. Under nutrient replete conditions, corals may have the ability to utilize more DIC, thus the calcification response to CO2 becomes the product of a negative effect on saturation state and a positive effect on gross carbon fixation, depending upon which dominates, the calcification response can be either positive or negative. This may help explain how the range of coral responses found in different studies of ocean acidification can be obtained. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM.

We combined microsampling molecular genotyping with in situ pulse-amplitude modulated fluorometry to correlate colony variability of Symbiodinium population identities and the phenomena of partial coral bleaching. Pigmented nonbleached portions of O. (= M.) faveolata were compared with bleached portions of the same colony. During bleaching, maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII; F-v : F-m) was significantly lower and highly variable (range 0.110 to 0.680) compared with previous summers in which coral bleaching was absent (range 0.516 to 0.661) and recovery (range 0.480 to 0.716). Differential susceptibility to environmental perturbation of F-v : F-m corresponded to distinct genetic identities of Symbiodinium. Analysis of ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) revealed regions of the coral colonies that had phylotype A3 prior to bleaching were more resistant to the bleaching perturbation than adjacent bleaching-prone patches that harbored phylotypes B17 and C7. During environmental perturbation, regions of the colonies containing predominantly Symbiodinium phylotypes A3 or D1a retained significantly higher F-v : F-m values than adjacent regions with phylotypes B17 and C7. Following bleaching, rapid recovery of symbiotic algal densities greatly exceeded normal seasonal oscillations. During recovery we document shifts in Symbiodinium populations and increase prevalence of Symbiodinium types A3 and D1a, phylotypes known to have enhanced thermal tolerances.

To explore the coral response to LAIW, prey capture disposition and photosynthesis were investigated in relation to changes in seawater temperature, pH, flow speed and food availability in LAIW simulation studies under controlled laboratory conditions, using Porites lutea as a model organism. Although food presence stimulated polyp expansion, we found an overriding effect of low temperature (19 degrees C) causing retraction of the coral polyps into their calices, particularly when pH was altered concomitantly. Decreases in pH alone, however, caused the expansion of the polyps. The exposure history of the colonies played a crucial role in coral responses: prior field exposure to LAIW yielded lower retraction levels than in LAIW-inexperienced corals, suggesting acclimatization. Low temperature (19 degrees C) exposure did not seem to influence the photosynthetic performance, but LAIW-experienced corals showed higher values of maximum dark-adapted quantum yield (F-v/F-m) of photosystem II than LAIW-inexperienced controls. Collectively, these data suggest that P. lutea, the dominant hermatypic coral in the Andaman Sea, can acclimatize to extreme changes in its abiotic environment by modulating its mixotrophic nutrition, through polyp expansion and potential feeding, as well as its photosynthetic efficiency.",COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",English,"Pacherres, CO (Corresponding Author), Helmholtz Ctr Polar \& Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Alten Hafen 26, D-27568 Bremerhaven, Germany.

In this research we grew 2 Stylophora pistillata coral microcolonies over glass coverslips to allow analysis of the pH sensitive dye SNARF-1, in the extracellular calcification medium at the growing edge of colonies where the first aragonite crystals are formed, under both light and dark conditions. We use secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) to measure the boron isotopic composition (811B) of the skeleton close to the growth edge after 2 to 3 days of additional calcification had enlarged the crystals until they joined, generating a continuous sheet of aragonite. Mean skeletal 811B-pHCM estimates are higher than those by SNARF-1 by 0.35-0.44 pH units. These differences either reflect real variations in the pH of the calcification media associated with each measurement technique or indicate other changes in the biomineralisation process which influence skeletal 811B. SNARF-1 measures directly the pH of the extracellular calcification medium while skeletal 811B analyses aragonite potentially formed via both extracellular and intracellular biomineralisation pathways. Analysis of a third coral specimen, also growing on a glass slide but with a 5 cm long branch, indicated good agreement between the 811B value of the apex of the branch and the skeletal growth edge. The tissues overlying both these regions were transparent indicating they had low symbiont densities.

Rising seawater temperature and low dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions are expected to intensify as a result of climate change. Understanding the responses of corals to these stressors is necessary for making predictions and devising mitigation strategies. The three coral species-Porites lutea, Montipora tuberculosa, and Pocillopora verrucosa-were sampled from Patong Bay, Phuket, Thailand, as representatives of different coral morphologies. Coral nubbins were subjected to experimental investigation under ambient conditions (29 degrees C, DO > 6 mgL(-1)), heat stress (32 degrees C), hypoxia (DO < 2 mgL(-1)), and heat stress + hypoxia treatments. Photosynthetic performance indicators Fv/Fm and Fv/F0 and physiological parameters Symbiodiniaceae density, pigment concentration, and growth rate were quantified. We found P. verrucosa (branching) to be the most sensitive and severely affected by heat stress or hypoxia, more so than P. lutea (massive) and M. tuberculosa (tabular). The combination of these stressors had less impact on these species, except for a decline in growth rate of M. tuberculosa. This study also suggests that the corals respond differently to high temperature and low oxygen, with their sensitivity depending on species. These responses, however, may differ according to the lighting, especially in hypoxic conditions. The results fill a research gap to help predict the vulnerability of these three coral species in shallow reef habitats under climate change scenarios.",MDPI,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",English,"Yucharoen, M (Corresponding Author), Prince Songkla Univ, Marine \& Coastal Resources Inst, Fac Environm Management, Hat Yai 90110, Thailand.

This study examined the effects of exposure to darkness for 30 days and the subsequent 11 days of recovery under a normal photoperiod on the outer mantle of the fluted giant clam Tridacna squamosa. Changes in the abundance of iridocytes and symbionts were assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Light microscopy was applied to quantify symbionts isolated from the outer mantle, while chlorophyll was extracted and analyzed by spectroscopy. The transcript levels of the host's vacuolar-type H+-ATPase subunit A (ATP6V1A) and symbionts' form II ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Zoox-rbcII) were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and used as proxies for iridocyte abundance and phototrophic potential, respectively. The protein abundance of ATP6V1A and Zoox-RBCII was quantified by western blotting. After exposure to darkness for 30 days, the outer mantle of T. squamosa individuals lost the distinct multiple color patterns, and the gene and protein expression levels of ATP6V1A/ATP6V1A and Zoox-rbcII/Zoox-RBCII decreased dramatically. Microscopy assessment confirmed the reduction in iridocyte and symbiont populations, and the chlorophyll level also decreased considerably. However, just 11 days after returning to a normal light:dark regimen, the quantity of coccoid dinoflagellates and the expression of Zoox-rbcII/Zoox-RBCII in the outer mantle increased significantly to levels higher than those of the individuals prior to exposure to darkness (control), while the chlorophyll content returned to the control level. Additionally, the outer mantle regained most of its coloration with partial recovery of the iridocyte population. These results are relevant not only for understanding the phenomena of light deprivation and symbiont loss in dinoflagellate-associated reef organisms, but also signify that the giant clam-coccoid dinoflagellate holobiont is phototrophically plastic and particularly tolerant to bleaching.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"Chew, SF (Corresponding Author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ, Nat Sci \& Sci Educ, 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616, Singapore.

In contrast, total chlorophyll symbiont cell(-1) increased in the future temperature treatments, and light-adapted effective quantum yield remained similar in all treatments.

The responses of free-living Symbiodinium to elevated temperature, however, have been little studied, especially in the context of their natural habitat. In this study, we investigated physiological responses of two Symbiodinium cultures to elevated temperature, an exclusively free-living ITS2 clade A (strain HI-0509) and the symbiosis-forming ITS2 type A1 (strain CCMP2467). Free-living Symbiodinium strains have recently been isolated from benthic sediments, and both cultures were therefore grown with or without a microhabitat of carbonate sediment at 25, 28 or 31 A degrees C. Maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (F (v)/F (m)) and specific growth rate were measured as response variables. In culture, Symbiodinium cells exhibit motility in a helical swimming pattern, and therefore, revolutions per minute (RPM) were also measured with video microscopy. The exclusively free-living clade A was physiologically superior to Symbiodinium A1 across all measured variables and treatment combinations. F (v)/F (m) remained relatively stable through time (at approximately 0.55) and was not substantially affected by temperature or the presence or the absence of sediment. Populations of the exclusively free-living Symbiodinium A reproduced faster with sediment than without and exhibited high levels of motility across all treatments (surpassing 300 RPM). In contrast, the F (v)/F (m) of A1 dropped to 0.42 in sediment (relative to cultures without sediment) and exhibited dramatic declines in cell concentration, most severely at 31 A degrees C. A > 50 \% reduction in motility was also observed at 31 A degrees C. Even in the absence of sediment, elevated temperature was observed to reduce population growth and cell motility of type A1. We suggest that vital behaviours linked to motility (such as vertical migration and the locating of potential hosts) may become impaired during future thermal anomalies and that populations of Symbiodinium A1 may only live transiently in sediment or outside coral hosts. Such differences in physiology between distinct Symbiodinium types may represent adaptations that are either conserved or lost depending on the differing selection pressures that come with living in symbiosis or free in the environment.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"Nitschke, MR (Corresponding Author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.

Most corals acquire their symbiotic algae (Symbiodiniaceae) from the environment in each generation (horizontal transmission). For horizontal transmitters, the quick establishment of symbiosis is important for their survival, since the photosynthetic activity of symbiotic algae provides energy. However, recent studies have indicated that oxidative stress resulting from photosynthesis might also harm coral larvae. Therefore, it remains unclear whether symbionts contribute energy sources along with intrinsic lipids from eggs and assist in settlement/metamorphosis in early life stages. In the present study, we show that symbiotic algae contribute supplemental energy and are also associated with settlement. Furthermore, although juveniles acquired symbiotic algae after settlement, the acquisition of symbiotic algae in the larval stages caused higher growth (number of polyps and size) and low mortality in the juvenile stage. Our data suggest that symbiotic larvae potentially have longer dispersal periods due to their lower lipid consumption rates, which make them better able to retain buoyancy and motility, increasing the ability of symbiotic larvae to settle in favored locations compared with aposymbiotic larvae. Moreover, postsettlement juveniles may continue to benefit from symbiotic relationships formed during the larval stage. Overall, these findings reveal that the effects of symbiotic algae on Acropora tenuis coral larvae are beneficial, particularly under normal seawater temperature conditions.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Harii, S (Corresponding Author), Univ Ryukyus, Sesoko Stn, Trop Biosphere Res Ctr, Motobu, Okinawa 9050227, Japan.

Previous studies have also hypothesised that photosymbiont-containing sponges might have higher productivity under future OA conditions as a result of photosymbionts having increased access to CO2 and subsequently greater carbon production. Here we test this hypothesis for a widespread and abundant photosymbiont-containing sponge species Lamellodysidea herbacea at a CO2 seep in Papua New Guinea simulating OA conditions. We found seep sponges had relatively higher cyanobacterial abundance, chlorophyll concentrations and symbiont photosynthetic efficiency than non-seep sponges, and a three-fold higher sponge abundance at the seep site. However, while gross oxygen production was the same for seep and non-seep sponges, seep sponge dark respiration rates were higher and instantaneous photosynthesis: respiration (P:R) ratios were lower. We show that while photosymbiont containing sponges may not have increased productivity under OA, they are able to show flexibility in their relationships with microbes and offset increased metabolic costs associated with climate change associated stress.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Bell, JJ (Corresponding Author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington 6012, New Zealand.

Understanding the mechanisms that regulate these symbioses will inform strategies for sustaining healthy coral-reef communities. A model system for corals is the symbiosis between the sea anemone Exaiptasia pallida (common name Aiptasia) and its dinoflagellate partners (family Symbiodiniaceae). To complement existing studies of the interactions between these organisms, we examined the impact of menthol, a reagent often used to render cnidarians aposymbiotic, on the dinoflagellate Breviolum minutum, both in culture and in hospite. In both environments, the growth and photosynthesis of this alga were compromised at either 100 or 300 mu M menthol. We observed reduction in PSII and PSI functions, the abundances of reaction-center proteins, and, at 300 mu M menthol, of total cellular proteins. Interestingly, for free-living algae exposed to 100 mu M menthol, an initial decline in growth, photosynthetic activities, pigmentation, and protein abundances reversed after 5-15 d, eventually approaching control levels. This behavior was observed in cells maintained in continuous light, but not in cells experiencing a light-dark regimen, suggesting that B. minutum can detoxify menthol or acclimate and repair damaged photosynthetic complexes in a light- and/or energy-dependent manner. Extended exposures of cultured algae to 300 mu M menthol ultimately resulted in algal death. Most symbiotic anemones were also unable to survive this menthol concentration for 30 d. Additionally, cells impaired for photosynthesis by pre-treatment with 300 mu M menthol exhibited reduced efficiency in re-populating the anemone host.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Clowez, S (Corresponding Author), Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Plant Biol, 260 Panama St, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.

Mass coral bleaching is often triggered by elevated water temperature and excessive solar irradiance. Shading can reduce coral bleaching risk. Shading-based management interventions, such as whole-of-reef marine fogging, have been proposed as a conservation tool for periods when coral undergoes excessive thermal stress. This study examined the effect of intermittent shade (30\% for 0, 4, or 24 h) on two coral species, Duncanopsammia axifuga and Turbinaria reniformis, held at either 26.4 \& DEG;C or 32.4 \& DEG;C for 18 days. Coral fragments were assessed for bleaching (relative mean intensity of grey, chlorophyll a, and symbiont density), photochemistry (PAM fluorometry), and antioxidant biomarkers (SOD and CAT). Shading responses were species-specific, with T. reniformis more responsive to shading than D. axifuga. Thirty per cent shading delayed bleaching up to three-degree heat weeks (DHW), and 24 h shade was more protective than 4 h shade. Shading suppressed catalase activity in T. reniformis.

The mechanism that triggers this expulsion of the algal symbionts is not resolved, but has been attributed to damage to the photosynthetic mechanism of the zooxanthellae. In the present investigation we addressed the question of whether such expelled zooxanthellae are indeed impaired irreversibly in their photosynthesis. We employed a Microscopy Pulse Amplitude-Modulated (PAM) fluorometer, by which individual zooxanthellae can be examined to study photosynthesis in zooxanthellae expelled when corals are subjected to a temperature of 33 degreesC. We show that the expelled zooxanthellae from Cyphastrea serailia were largely unaffected in their photosynthesis and could be heated to 37 degreesC before showing temperature-induced photosynthetic impairment. These results suggest strongly that the early events that trigger temperature-induced expulsion of zooxanthellae involve a dysfunction in the interaction of the zooxanthellae and the coral host tissue, and not a dysfunction in the zooxanthellae per se.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",English,"Ralph, PJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Technol Sydney, Dept Environm Sci, POB 123 Broadway, Sydney, NSW 2065, Australia.

In addition to their close association with endosymbiotic dinoflagellates of the family Symbiodiniaceae, enabling an effective use and retention of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), scleractinian corals have developed strategies to acquire new N: (1) They can ingest N-rich sediment particles and preys (from picoplankton to macro-zooplankton) via heterotrophy, including diazotrophs [}plankton fixing dinitrogen (N2) and releasing part of this nitrogen-Diazotroph-Derived N (DDN)-in seawater], a pathway called ``heterotrophic nutrition on diazotrophs{''}; (2) Symbiotic diazotrophs located in the coral holobiont have the molecular machinery to fix N2, a pathway called ``symbiotic N2 fixation{''}. Here we used the 15N2 isotopic labeling in a series of incubations to investigate the relative contribution of each of these DDN transfer pathways in three worldwide distributed coral species: Acropora muricata, Galaxea fascicularis, and Pocillopora damicornis. We show that N provision via ``symbiotic N2 fixation{''} is negligible compared to that obtained via ``heterotrophic nutrition on diazotrophs,{''} with DDN assimilation rates about a thousand times lower for P. damicornis and G. fascicularis, or assimilation rates via ``symbiotic N2 fixation{''} almost nil for A. muricata. Through heterotrophic feeding on planktonic diazotrophs, only G. fascicularis and P. damicornis can successfully obtain N and fulfill a large part of their N requirements (DDN asimilation rates: 0.111 +/- 0.056 and 0.517 +/- 0.070 mu g N cm-2 h-1 in their Symbiodiniaceae, respectively). Whereas this contribution is again negligible for A. muricata. They also largely consume the picoplankton that likely benefit from this DDN (Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus cells; respectively, 2.56 +/- 1.57 104 and 2.70 +/- 1.66 104 cell h-1 cm-2 for G. fascicularis; 3.02 +/- 0.19 105 and 1.14 +/- 0.79 104 cell h-1 cm-2 for P. damicornis). The present study confirms the different dependencies of the three tested species regarding heterotrophy, with P. damicornis and G. fascicularis appearing highly efficient at capturing plankton, while A. muricata, considered as mainly autotroph, does not rely on these food resources to meet its N and energy needs. <comment>Superscript/Subscript Available</comment",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",English,"Meunier, V (Corresponding Author), Univ La Nouvelle Caledonie, CNRS, Univ La Reunion, Ctr IRD Noumea,UMR ENTROPIE,IRD,Ifremer, Noumea, New Caledonia.

In particular, O-18/O-16 ratios correlate with the temperature and salinity of seawater and C-13/C-12 is a proxy for dissolved inorganic carbon in seawater and symbiont photosynthesis. Here, we report C-13/C-12 and O-18/O-16 values for skeletons of corals (genus Porites) with various growth rates. In faster-growing coral S, C-13/C-12 and O-18/O-16 showed out-of-phase annual fluctuations. In slower-growing corals, the isotopes fluctuated in phase. We developed a simple vector notation to show two patterns of C-13/C-12 annual fluctuation, each with a different offset in relation to O-18/O-16 annual fluctuation. The phase offset between C-13/C-12 and O-18/O-16 annual fluctuations depends on the relative intensities of kinetic isotope effects on calcification and metabolic isotope effects such as photosynthesis. This model might improve our ability to infer past climate and oceanographic conditions from coral skeletons.

The ecological success of coral reef ecosystems critically depends on coral-algal symbiosis and coral-prokaryotic partnership. However, seasonal changes underlying these relationships in subtropical hard corals of Hong Kong are poorly studied. Here, we compared the community changes of algal symbionts and prokaryotic partners in Platygyra carnosa and Galaxea fascicularis from Hong Kong collected at two seasonal time points of winter and summer via massively parallel sequencing of genetic markers and multivariate analysis. The results indicated that algal symbionts showed no significant changes between the two seasonal time points but prokaryotic partners changed substantially. Prokaryotic partners putatively involved in photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, and sulfur oxidation increased significantly from winter to summer, while prokaryotic partners potentially associated with chemosynthesis, ammonia oxidation, and nitrite oxidation decreased significantly from winter to summer. Dissolved oxygen and pH served as the main contributors influencing prokaryotic partners in winter, while temperature, turbidity, and salinity played a dominant role in shaping prokaryotic partners in summer. The findings of the present study suggest that season structures prokaryotic partners but not algal symbionts in subtropical hard corals.",SPRINGER,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",English,"Qian, PY (Corresponding Author), Hong Kong Univ Sci \& Technol, Shenzhen Res Inst, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

We examined markers of oxidative stress, including lipid peroxidation (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, indicators of bleaching, including chlorophyll a (Chl a) and carotenoid pigment (PC) levels, as well as zooxanthellae density. Our results revealed that N, P and C coral samples all contained higher levels of PC versus Chl a. The levels of both pigments increased as the temperature increased from 22 to 28 degrees C only in N and C samples, whereas P samples showed less cellular damage than N and C samples at temperatures between 26 and 28 degrees C, and had greater antioxidant activities at temperatures between 26 and 30 degrees C. The rate of zooxanthellar expulsion consistently increased with temperature in all three coral types across the entire temperature range. Collectively, these results indicate that temperature has a direct effect on the antagonistic relationship between temperature-induced damage and protective antioxidant mechanisms in this type of coral.

In recent decades, coral reefs have experienced a significant global decline due to a variety of causes, one of the major causes being widespread coral bleaching events. During bleaching, the coral expels its symbiotic algae, thereby losing its main source of nutrition generally obtained through photosynthesis. While recent coral bleaching events have been extensively investigated, there is no scientific data on historical coral bleaching prior to 1979. In this study, we employ high-resolution femtosecond Laser Ablation Multiple Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS) to demonstrate a distinct biologically induced decline of boron (B) isotopic composition (delta B-11) as a result of coral bleaching. These findings and methodology offer a new use for a previously developed isotopic proxy to reconstruct paleo-coral bleaching events. Based on a literature review of published delta B-11 data and our recorded vital effect of coral bleaching on the delta B-11 signal, we also describe at least two possible coral bleaching events since the Last Glacial Maximum. The implementation of this bleaching proxy holds the potential of identifying occurrences of coral bleaching throughout the geological record. A deeper temporal view of coral bleaching will enable scientists to determine if it occurred in the past during times of environmental change and what outcome it may have had on coral population structure. Understanding the frequency of bleaching events is also critical for determining the relationship between natural and anthropogenic causes of these events.",COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",English,"Tchernov, D (Corresponding Author), Univ Haifa, Leon H Charney Sch Marine Sci, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.

Heterogeneity between coral species and symbiont clades was identified in the thermal sensitivity of photosynthesis in the symbionts of the scleractinian corals Stylophora pistillata and Pocillopora damicornis, as well as among Symbiodinium cultures of clades A, B, and C. The in hospite symbionts of S. pistillata and the cultured clade C Symbiodinium both exhibited similar patterns in that their primary site of thermal inhibition occurred downstream of ferredoxin at 32 degrees C. In contrast, the primary site of thermal inhibition occurred upstream of ferredoxin in clades A and B at 32 degrees C, while at 34 degrees C, all samples showed combined up- and downstream inhibition. Although clade C is common to both P. damicornis and S. pistillata, the manner of thermal inhibition was not consistent when observed in hospite.

However, the effects of ocean acidification and warming on the growth and gene transcription of thermo-tolerant algae are poorly understood. Here we determined the effects of elevated temperature (H) and acidification (A) on a recently discovered coral-associated thermo-tolerant alga Symbiochlorum hainanensis by culturing it under two temperature settings (26.0 and 32.0 degrees C) crossed with two pH levels (8.16 and 7.81). The results showed that the growth of S. hainanensis was positively affected by H, A, and the combined treatment (AH). However, no superimposition effect of H and A on the growth of S. hainanensis was observed under AH. The analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence, pigment content, and subcellular morphology indicated that the chloroplast morphogenesis (enlargement) along with the increase of chlorophyll fluorescence and pigment content of S. hainanensis might be a universal mechanism for promoting the growth of S. hainanensis. Transcriptomic profiles revealed the effect of elevated temperature on the response of S. hainanensis to acidification involved in the down-regulation of photosynthesis- and carbohydrate metabolism-related genes but not the up-regulation of genes related to antioxidant and ubiquitination processes. Overall, this study firstly reports the growth, morphology, and molecular response of the thermo-tolerant alga S. hainanensis to future climate changes, suggesting the predominance of S. hainanensis in its associated corals and/or coral reefs in the future.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",English,"Li, ZY (Corresponding Author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Marine Biotechnol Lab, State Key Lab Microbial Metab, Shanghai, Peoples R China.

The link between coral Sr/Ca and SST is not well-understood and there have been a number of discrepant observations {[}de Villiers et al., 1995; Alibert, 1998]. Corals with symbiotic zooxanthellae are known to show large diurnal fluctuations in calcification rate associated with the photosynthetic activity of their symbionts. Using detailed measurements with the ion microprobe, we compared the Sr/Ca content of discrete daytime and nighttime skeletal structures in the massive hermatypic coral Porites lutea over the course of 1 year and a seasonal temperature range of 4 degreesC. The Sr/Ca content of daytime skeleton is always lower than that of adjacent nighttime skeleton. While the slope of the nighttime Sr/Ca-SST correlation is close to that seen in inorganic aragonite precipitates, that of the daytime correlation is >4 times as steep. We attribute these differences to the role of photosynthesis in calcification and conclude that bulk Sr/Ca is related principally to daytime calcification rate rather than directly to SST.

Since rising atmospheric CO2 is responsible for global warming and increasing ocean acidity, to correctly predict how OW and OA will affect marine organisms, their possible interactive effects must be assessed. Here we investigate, in the field, the combined temperature (range: 16-26 degrees C) and acidification (range: pHTS 8.1-7.4) effects on mortality and growth of Mediterranean coral species transplanted, in different seasonal periods, along a natural pH gradient generated by a CO2 vent. We show a synergistic adverse effect on mortality rates (up to 60\%), for solitary and colonial, symbiotic and asymbiotic corals, suggesting that high seawater temperatures may have increased their metabolic rates which, in conjunction with decreasing pH, could have led to rapid deterioration of cellular processes and performance. The net calcification rate of the symbiotic species was not affected by decreasing pH, regardless of temperature, while in the two asymbiotic species it was negatively affected by increasing acidification and temperature, suggesting that symbiotic corals may be more tolerant to increasing warming and acidifying conditions compared to asymbiotic ones.",NATURE PORTFOLIO,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",English,"Goffredo, S (Corresponding Author), Univ Bologna, Dept Biol Geol \& Environm Sci, Marine Sci Grp, Via Selmi 3, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.

These conditions result in a decline in photochemical efficiency of symbiotic microalgae (zooxanthellae) which ultimately leads to the expulsion of these symbionts. The physiological mechanism which triggers the release of the zooxanthellae has yet to be adequately determined. Under bleaching conditions, non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) is used to dissipate excess energy from photosystem II (PSII). NPQ was partitioned into three components, (energy dependent quenching [}qE], state transition quenching {[}qT] and photoinhibitory quenching [}qI]), based on relaxation kinetics upon addition of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) and darkening. This investigation revealed that for corals not exposed to bleaching stress, qE was the principle means of energy dissipation (similar to 60\% of the total NPQ). In corals exposed to either high-light (475 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) and 25 degrees C) or elevated temperature (225 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) and 32 degrees C) treatments, the dominant component of NPQ was qE and the relative proportions did not change during the exposure period (1-8 h). When exposed to bleaching conditions (475 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) and 32 degrees C) the contribution of the different components changed after 4 h and the total NPQ increased. At this time, the contribution of qT to the total NPQ significantly increased to equal that of qE (40\%), suggesting state transitions become more important under such conditions. Throughout the exposure period in all treatments, no change in the proportion of qI was observed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Biological parameters and coral optical properties were monitored during and after the stress. Increases in both, the excitation pressure over photosystem II (Qm) and pigment specific absorption (a{*}(Chla)) were observed in the stressed corals, associated with reductions in light absorption at the chlorophyll a red peak (D-e675) and symbiont population density. All coral fragments exposed to heat stress bleached but a fraction of the stressed corals recovered after removing the stress, as indicated by the reductions in Q(m) and increases in D-e675 and the symbiont population observed. This subsample of the experimentally bleached corals also showed blooms of the endolithic algae Ostreobium spp. underneath the tissue. Using a numerical model, we quantified the amount of incident light reflected by the coral, and absorbed by the different pigmented components: symbionts, host-tissue and Ostreobium spp. Our study supports the key contribution of Ostreobium spp. blooms near the skeletal surface, to coral recovery after bleaching by reducing skeleton reflectance. Endolithic blooms can thus significantly alleviate the high light stress that affects the remaining symbionts during the stress or when the coral has achieved the bleached phenotype.",NATURE PORTFOLIO,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",English,"Galindo-MartÃ­nez, CT; Iglesias-Prieto, R (Corresponding Author), Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, 208 Mueller Lab, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.

As a result, attempts to describe the organismic effects of environmental degradation and physiological stress can prove misleading. Functional benchmarks and the effects of stress are particularly germane to coral reefs that globally are exposed to significant environmental challenges, and in this study, we compiled data on scleractinian corals to describe a reference against which stress responses can be gauged. Based on this construct, we tested the veracity of well-established contrasts-involving differences in physiological function among depths and families-to evaluate the capacity of available data to support synthetic analyses. Our analysis used 126 papers describing 37 genera, and at least 73 species, and described 13 traits, first independent of depth, and second, by depth. Data appropriate for these analyses were so sparse that depth-and family-level effects were inconspicuous, although the depth contrast revealed a decline in dark respiration and an increase in calcification (both normalized to area) in deeper water. Our analyses of scleractinian literature revealed limitations of the data available for synthetic analyses, as well for describing functional benchmarks within this taxon. We attribute some of these effects to differences in the physical environment under which measurements were made, and suspect that such problems are commonplace for other taxa. Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) models provide one means to overcome some of these problems, and they can be used for any taxon to quantitatively summarize data for comparative analyses of stressor responses. The suitability of these models is illustrated for scleractinian corals by predicting from first principles the ratio of Symbiodinium to holobiont carbon and the respiration.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"Edmunds, PJ (Corresponding Author), Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, 18111 Nordhoff St, Northridge, CA 91330 USA.

Review of zooxanthellae and their response to environmental stress,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE,2021,117,8-Jul,31-37,JUL-AUG,"Coral reefs are diverse and productive but sensitive ecosystems. Due to the impact of climate change, these organisms are in danger of dying out, mainly through the process of coral bleaching, which is the process by which zooxanthellae (algal endosymbionts) are expelled from their respective coral hosts, causing the coral to lose colour and become white. Coral bleaching has been linked to increases in sea surface temperatures as well as an increase in light intensity. We reviewed the different zooxanthellae taxa and their ecological traits, as well as the information available on the protective mechanisms present in zooxanthellae cells when they experience environmental stress conditions, such as temperature fluctuations, specifically concentrating on heat shock proteins and their response to antioxidant stress. The eight clades (A-H) previously recognised were reorganised into seven existing genera. Different zooxanthellae taxa exhibit different ecological traits such as their photosynthetic stress responses to light and temperature. Zooxanthellae have the ability to regulate the number and type of heat shock proteins (Hsps) they produce during a heat response. They can also regulate the host's respective Hsps. Antioxidant responses that can prevent coral hosts from expelling the zooxanthellae, can be found both within exposed coral tissue and the zooxanthellae cells. Despite the lower likelihood of bleaching in South African coral reefs, genetic engineering presents a useful tool to understand and adapt traits within zooxanthellae genotypes to help mitigate coral bleaching in the future. Significance: Coral bleaching is the expulsion of zooxanthellae (algal symbionts) from the respective coral host, mainly due to elevated sea surface temperatures and light intensities, but numerous other factors, such as changes concerning salinity (ocean acidification), may also cause coral bleaching, although to a much lesser extent. A specific clade of zooxanthellae can be linked to their coral host's susceptibility to variation in oceanic temperatures, most probably by regulating both the host's respective heat shock proteins as well as their own. South African reefs have not experienced coral bleaching to the same degree as elsewhere in the world, mainly due to their unique reef topography and oceanic currents. Genetic bioengineering of zooxanthellae cells provides a plausible solution to save southern African coral reefs before it is too late.",ACAD SCIENCE SOUTH AFRICA A S S AF,"PO BOX 72135, LYNWOOD RIDGE 0040, SOUTH AFRICA",English,"Barnard, S (Corresponding Author), North West Univ, Unit Environm Sci \& Management, Potchefstroom, South Africa.

To better understand the molecular basis of the thermotolerance displayed by these corals, a laboratory-based temperature challenge experiment that also featured conspecifics from a more stress-susceptible offshore reef was conducted with the common Caribbean reef-builder Orbicela faveolata, and the proteomes of both the coral hosts and their endosymbiotic dinoflagellate communities were profiled in (1) controls, (2) corals that succumbed to high-temperature stress and bleached, and (3) those that instead acclimated to high temperatures ex situ. Proteomic signatures varied most significantly across temperatures, host genotypes, and Symbiodiniaceae assemblages, and the two eukaryotic compartments of this mutualism exhibited distinct proteomic responses to high temperatures. Both partners maintained high levels of molecular chaperones and other canonical (eukaryotic) stress response (CSR) proteins in all treatments (including controls). Instead, proteins involved in lipid trafficking, metabolism, and photosynthesis played greater roles in the holobionts' high-temperature responses, and these energy mobilization processes may have sustained the elevated protein turnover rates associated with the constitutively active CSR.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",English,"Mayfield, AB (Corresponding Author), Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine \& Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33124 USA.

Our study characterized the response of key photophysiological parameters, as well as photoacclimatory and photoprotective pigments (chlorophylls, xanthophylls, and beta-carotene), to short-term (5-d) cold stress (similar to 15 degrees C; 7 degrees C below control) in three LHI coral species hosting distinct Symbiodinium ITS2 types, and compared the coral-symbiont response to that under elevated temperature (similar to 29 degrees C; 7 degrees C above control). Under cold stress, Stylophora sp. hosting Symbiodinium C118 showed the strongest effects with regard to losses of photochemical performance and symbionts. Pocillopora damicornis hosting Symbiodinium C100/C118 showed less severe bleaching responses to reduced temperature than to elevated temperature, while Porites heronensis hosting Symbiodinium C111{*} withstood both reduced and elevated temperature. Under cold stress, photoprotection in the form of xanthophyll deepoxidation increased in unbleached P. heronensis (by 178\%) and bleached Stylophora sp.

Inspired by the `oxidative stress theory of coral bleaching', we investigated whether a bacterial consortium designed to scavenge free radicals could integrate into the host microbiome and improve thermal tolerance of the coral model, Exaiptasia diaphana. Methods and Results E. diaphana anemones were inoculated with a consortium of high free radical scavenging (FRS) bacteria, a consortium of congeneric low FRS bacteria, or sterile seawater as a control, then exposed to elevated temperature. Increases in the relative abundance of Labrenzia during the first 2 weeks following the last inoculation provided evidence for temporary inoculum integration into the E. diaphana microbiome. Initial uptake of other consortium members was inconsistent, and these bacteria did not persist either in E. diaphana's microbiome over time. Given their non-integration into the host microbiome, the ability of the FRS consortium to mitigate thermal stress could not be assessed. Importantly, there were no physiological impacts (negative or positive) of the bacterial inoculations on the holobiont. Conclusions The introduced bacteria were not maintained in the anemone microbiome over time, thus, their protective effect is unknown. Achieving long-term integration of bacteria into cnidarian microbiomes remains a research priority. Significance and Impact of the Study Microbiome engineering strategies to mitigate coral bleaching may assist coral reefs in their persistence until climate change has been curbed.

Low and high short-term thermal bleaching thresholds of the coral-symbiont partnership were measured as 14 degrees C and 30 degrees C. Photochemical sensitivity to temperature (15 degrees C and 29 degrees C) and light treatments (100\% and 40\% of sunlight), measured as effective quantum yield and fast induction curves, were determined over a 72-h period. A greater effect on the photochemical reactions of LHI P. damicornis symbionts was recorded in response to a 3 degrees C temperature increase from annual maxima than a 3 degrees C temperature decrease from annual minima. Corals did not bleach when temperature was reduced to 15 degrees C for 72 h; in contrast, a 92\% decline in photochemical efficiency was recorded in the 29 degrees C treatment (Delta F: F-m' < 0.05), compared to 35\% loss in the control (20 degrees C).

Therefore, environmental variables influencing coral metabolism should also affect skeletal delta(13)C levels. To test this hypothesis, we measured the effects of light (which drives photosynthesis) and relative zooplankton levels (heterotrophy) on skeletal delta(13)C values in the corals Pavona clavus and P. gigantea at two depths (1 m and 7 m). For both species, decreases in light or increases in zooplankton resulted in significant decreases in skeletal delta(13)C levels. A significant decrease in delta(13)C values with depth was observed in Pavona gigantea only. Thus, light and zooplankton directly affect coral skeletal delta(13)C values, supporting the hypothesis that metabolic fractionation significantly contributes to skeletal delta(13)C levels. Simultaneous decreases in both light and zooplankton resulted in decreases in skeletal delta(13)C values, reflecting decreases in light. In Pavona clavus, intra-annual variation in skeletal delta(13)C values over one year correlated with seasonal changes in irradiance.

Our study investigated how the presence of symbiotic dinoflagellates affects the response of pH(i) to P-CO2-driven seawater acidification in cells isolated from Pocillopora damicornis. Using the fluorescent dye BCECF-AM, in conjunction with confocal microscopy, we simultaneously characterised the pH(i) response in host coral cells and their dinoflagellate symbionts, in symbiotic and non-symbiotic states under saturating light, with and without the photosynthetic inhibitor DCMU. Each treatment was run under control (pH 7.8) and CO2-acidified seawater conditions (decreasing pH from 7.8 to 6.8). After 105 min of CO2 addition, by which time the external pH (pH(e)) had declined to 6.8, the dinoflagellate symbionts had increased their pH(i) by 0.5 pH units above control levels when in the absence of DCMU. In contrast, in both symbiotic and non-symbiotic host coral cells, 15 min of CO2 addition (0.2 pH unit drop in pH(e)) led to cytoplasmic acidosis equivalent to 0.3-0.4 pH units irrespective of whether DCMU was present. Despite further seawater acidification over the duration of the experiment, the pH(i) of non-symbiotic coral cells did not change, though in host cells containing a symbiont cell the pH(i) recovered to control levels when photsynthesis was not inhibited. This recovery was negated when cells were incubated with DCMU.

Yet, the initial site of damage, and early dynamics of the impairment are still not well resolved. In this perspective essay, I consider further a recent hypothesis which proposes an energetic disruption to the carbon-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) of the coral host, and the resultant onset of CO2-limitation within the photosynthetic ``dark reactions{''} as a unifying cellular mechanism. The hypothesis identifies the enhanced retention of photosynthetic carbon for zooxanthellae (re) growth following an initial irradiance-driven expulsion event as a strong contributing cause of the energetic disruption. If true, then it implies that the onset of the bleaching syndrome and setting of upper thermal bleaching limits are emergent attributes of the coral symbiosis that are ultimately underpinned by the characteristic growth profile of the intracellular zooxanthellae; which is known to depend not just on temperature, but also external (seawater) nutrient availability and zooxanthellae genotype. Here, I review this proposed bleaching linkage at a variety of observational scales, and find it to be parsimonious with the available evidence. Future experiments are suggested that can more formally test the linkage. If correct, the new cellular model delivers a valuable new perspective to consider the future prospects of the coral symbiosis in an era of rapid environmental change, including: (i) the underpinning mechanics (and biological significance) of observed changes in resident zooxanthellae genotypes, and (ii) the now crucial importance of reef water quality in co-determining thermal bleaching resistance.",COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",English,"Wooldridge, SA (Corresponding Author), Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia.

Past research has established that oxidative stress in the symbiont plays an important part in the bleaching cascade. Corals hosting different genotypes of Symbiodinium may have varying thermal bleaching thresholds, but changes in the symbiont's antioxidant system that may accompany these differences have received less attention. This study shows that constitutive activity and up-regulation of different parts of the antioxidant network under thermal stress differs between four Symbiodinium types in culture and that thermal susceptibility can be linked to glutathione redox homeostasis. In Symbiodinium B1, C1 and E, declining maximum quantum yield of PSII (F-v/F-m) and death at 33 degrees C were generally associated with elevated superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and a more oxidized glutathione pool. Symbiodinium F1 exhibited no decline in F-v/F-m or growth, but showed proportionally larger increases in ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity and glutathione content (GSx), while maintaining GSx in a reduced state. Depressed growth in Symbiodinium B1 at a sublethal temperature of 29 degrees C was associated with transiently increased APX activity and glutathione pool size, and an overall increase in glutathione reductase (GR) activity. The collapse of GR activity at 33 degrees C, together with increased SOD, APX and glutathione S-transferase activity, contributed to a strong oxidation of the glutathione pool with subsequent death. Integrating responses of multiple components of the antioxidant network highlights the importance of antioxidant plasticity in explaining type-specific temperature responses in Symbiodinium.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Krueger, T (Corresponding Author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.

Current models of symbiosis breakdown involve an immune response to an elevation in reactive oxygen species that ultimately results in the loss of the symbiont. However, the intimate nature of the symbiosis implies an important role for the symbiont surface as a point of interaction between partners. The response of symbiont cell surface proteins to experimental temperature stress was, therefore, investigated using a cell surface biotin probe. Cell-surface protein composition was found to be dynamically regulated in response to heat stress, particularly after 24 h of exposure to heat treatment. This pattern was primarily driven by an increased abundance in heat shock proteins, demonstrating that stress experienced by the symbiont can manifest at the cell surface. Elements known to activate host immunity were also increased in response to temperature stress, further demonstrating an avenue by which the symbiont can elicit a host immune response independent of reactive oxygen species. This work documents the cell surface protein composition of a Symbiodiniaceae species for the first time and highlights host-symbiont interaction mechanisms that may be important during symbiosis breakdown.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",English,"Mydlarz, LD (Corresponding Author), Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Biol, 501 S Nedderman Dr Rm 337, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.

Susceptibility to bleaching and mortality is variable among corals, and is determined by unknown proportions of environmental history and the synergy of Symbiodinium- and coral-specific properties. Symbiodinium live within host tissues overlaying the coral skeleton, which increases light availability through multiple light-scattering, forming one of the most efficient biological collectors of solar radiation. Light-transport in the upper similar to 200 mu m layer of corals skeletons (measured as `microscopic' reduced-scattering coefficient, mu'(S,m)), has been identified as a determinant of excess light increase during bleaching and is therefore a potential determinant of the differential rate and severity of bleaching response among coral species. Results: Here we experimentally demonstrate (in ten coral species) that, under thermal stress alone or combined thermal and light stress, low-mu'(S,m) corals bleach at higher rate and severity than high-mu'(S,m) corals and the Symbiodinium associated with low-mu'(S,m) corals experience twice the decrease in photochemical efficiency. We further modelled the light absorbed by Symbiodinium due to skeletal-scattering and show that the estimated skeleton-dependent light absorbed by Symbiodinium (per unit of photosynthetic pigment) and the temporal rate of increase in absorbed light during bleaching are several fold higher in low-mu'(S,m) corals. Conclusions: While symbionts associated with low-mu'(S,m) corals receive less total light from the skeleton, they experience a higher rate of light increase once bleaching is initiated and absorbing bodies are lost; further precipitating the bleaching response. Because microscopic skeletal light-scattering is a robust predictor of light-dependent bleaching among the corals assessed here, this work establishes mu'(S,m) as one of the key determinants of differential bleaching response.",BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,"236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",English,"Marcelino, LA (Corresponding Author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Civil \& Environm Engn, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.

However, their contribution to the total budget of reef carbon production has not been adequately quantified. We used O-2-respirometry and alkalinity-anomaly techniques to estimate the organic and inorganic carbon production rates of three species of symbiont-bearing large foraminifera common to coral reef flats in the northwest Pacific Ocean. The species studied were Baculogypsina sphaerulata and Calearina gaudichaudii, which both harbor diatom endosymbionts, and Marginopora kudakajimensis, which harbors dinoflagellate endosymbionts. Live mature individuals were placed onto mesh in clear airtight containers filled with filtered seawater. The containers were incubated for several hours at a constant temperature and subjected to different levels of light intensity. Seawater was continuously mixed throughout the experiment. Dissolved oxygen, pH and total alkalinity were measured before and after incubation. Three species of larger benthic foraminifera were net organic and inorganic carbon producers. The P/R ratio exceeded 1 for all species. No photoinhibition was observed up to 1500 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), and calcification was enhanced by light. These findings suggest that the three species are net carbon producers adapted to high-light, reef-flat environments. In addition, we calculated that Baculogypsina sphaerulata and C. gaudichaudii together accounted for 2-7.5\% of the gross primary production of a reef-crest community, whereas M. kudakajimensis supplied 1-11\% of the gross primary production of a backreef community. The two calcarinids and M. kudakajimensis contributed similar to 1 and 10\% of the inorganic carbon production of seaward reef flat and protected lagoon communities, respectively. Together with previous reports, these estimates suggest that algal symbiont-bearing foraminifera play a minor but essential role in the organic and inorganic carbon production of coral-reef ecosystems.",CUSHMAN FOUNDATION FORAMINIFERAL RES,"MUSEUM COMPARATIVE ZOOLOGY, DEPT INVERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY 26 OXFORD ST, HARVARD UNIV, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA",English,"Fujita, K (Corresponding Author), Univ Ryukyus, Dept Phys \& Earth Sci, Senbaru 1, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030213, Japan.

Global warming permits range expansions of tropical marine species into mid-latitude habitats, where they are, however, faced with cold winter temperatures. Therefore, tolerance to cold temperatures may be the key adaptation controlling zonal range expansion in tropical marine species. 2. Here we investigated the molecular and physiological response to cold and heat stress in a tropical symbiont-bearing foraminifera that has successfully invaded the Eastern Mediterranean. 3. Our physiological measurements indicate thermal tolerance of the diatom symbionts but a decrease in growth for the foraminifera host under both cold and warm stress. 4. The combined ('holobiont') transcriptome revealed an asymmetric response in short-term gene expression under cold versus warm stress. Cold stress induced major reorganization of metabolic processes, including regulation of genes involved in photosynthesis. Analyses limited to genes that are inferred to belong to the symbionts confirm that the observed pattern is due to changes in the regulation of photosynthesis-related genes and not due to changes in the abundance of the symbionts. 5. In contrast to cold stress, far fewer genes change expression under heat stress and those that do are primarily related to movement and cytoskeleton. This implies that under cold stress, cellular resources are allocated to the maintenance of photosynthesis, and the key to zonal range shifts of tropical species could be the cold tolerance of the symbiosis.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Abramovich, S; Abdu, U (Corresponding Author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.

This study explored individual and synergistic effects of present-day (pH 8.0, 28 degrees C) and near-future (pH 7.7, 32 degrees C) scenarios of ocean temperature and pH on the adult Favites colemani, a common massive reef-building coral in Bolinao-Anda, Philippines. Changes in seawater temperature drive the physiological responses of F. colemani, whereas changes in pH create an additive effect on survival, growth, and photosynthetic efficiency. Under near-future scenarios, F. colemani showed sustained photosynthetic competency despite the decline in growth rate and zooxanthellae density. F. colemani exhibited specificity with the Cladocopium clade C3u. This coral experienced lower growth rates but survived projected near-future ocean warming and acidification scenarios. Its pH-thermal stress threshold is possibly a consequence of acclimation and adaptation to local environmental conditions and past bleaching events.

While environmental factors did not co-vary with demographic characteristics in L. pruvoti, temperature was negatively related to the population density of B. europaea.

The coral symbiosis is highly susceptible to elevated temperatures, resulting in coral bleaching, where the algal symbiont is released from host cells. This experiment aimed to determine the transcriptional changes in cultured Symbiodinium, to better understand the response of cellular mechanisms under future temperature conditions. Cultures were exposed to elevated temperatures (average 31 degrees C) or control conditions (24.5 degrees C) for a period of 28 days. Whole transcriptome sequencing of Symbiodinium cells on days 4, 19, and 28 were used to identify differentially expressed genes under thermal stress. A large number of genes representing 37.01\% of the transcriptome (similar to 23,654 unique genes, FDR < 0.05) with differential expression were detected at no less than one of the time points. Consistent with previous studies of Symbiodinium gene expression, fold changes across the transcriptome were low, with 92.49\% differentially expressed genes at <= 2-fold change. The transcriptional response included differential expression of genes encoding stress response components such as the antioxidant network and molecular chaperones, cellular components such as core photosynthesis machinery, integral light-harvesting protein complexes and enzymes such as fatty acid desaturases. Differential expression of genes encoding glyoxylate cycle enzymes were also found, representing the first report of this in Symbiodinium.

Because of climate change, mass coral bleaching events will increase in frequency and severity in the future, threatening the persistence of this iconic marine ecosystem at global scale. Strategies adapted to coral reefs preservation and restoration may stem from the identification of the succession of events and of the different molecular and cellular contributors to the bleaching phenomenon. To date, studies aiming to decipher the cellular cascade leading to temperature-related bleaching, emphasized the involvement of reactive species originating from compromised bioenergetic pathways (e.g. cellular respiration and photosynthesis). These molecules are responsible for damage to various cellular components causing the dysregulation of cellular homeostasis and the breakdown of symbiosis. In this review, we synthesize the current knowledge available in the literature on the cellular mechanisms caused by thermal stress, which can initiate or participate in the cell cascade leading to the loss of symbionts, with a particular emphasis on the role of each partner in the initiating processes.",PORTLAND PRESS LTD,"1ST FLR, 10 QUEEN STREET PLACE, LONDON, ENGLAND",English,"Roberty, S (Corresponding Author), Univ Liege, InBioS Anim Physiol, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.

Here, we show that hot and cold temperature changes cause distinct physiological responses on different time scales in reef-building corals. We exposed the branching coral Acropora yongei in individual aquaria to a +/- 5 degrees C temperature change. Compared to heat-treated corals, cold-treated corals initially show greater declines in growth and increases in photosynthetic pressure. However, after 2-3 weeks, cold-treated corals acclimate and show improvements in physiological state. In contrast, heat did not initially harm photochemical efficiency, but after a delay, photosynthetic pressure increased rapidly and corals experienced severe bleaching and cessation of growth. These results suggest that short-term cold temperature is more damaging for branching corals than short-term warm temperature, whereas long-term elevated temperature is more harmful than long-term depressed temperature.",NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",English,"Roth, MS (Corresponding Author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Phys Biosci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.

We used the amount of physiological variation expressed in corals, and the proportion of this variation that could be explained by environmental variables, to construct hypotheses about the relative capacity for each species to adapt or acclimatize to differing conditions. Genus-level analyses indicated that Montipora and Pocillopora phenotypes are influenced more strongly by the environment than Porites corals. Species-level analyses revealed that Montipora capitata and Pocillopora acuta have the widest physiological niche boundaries, whereas Porites evermanni and Pocillopora meandrina are more physiologically restricted. Correlations between individual traits and the environmental gradient provided insight into potential adaptive mechanisms employed by each species that allow them to persist in reefs such as those within Kane'ohe Bay, where water flow is lowest, and temperature, acidity, and nutrient concentrations are highest relative to other reefs around O'ahu. Potential adaptive mechanisms included (a) increased surface-area-to-volume ratios to facilitate higher material flux across the diffusive boundary layer and/or to maximize light harvesting (M. capitata and P. acuta), (b) strategic investment of metabolic energy toward energy reserves (Montipora and Pocillopora), (c) changes in protein management likely via differential expression and function (Porites), and d) increased chlorophyll concentration per Symbiodiniaceae cell to maximize photosynthesis (Porites compressa). Comparison of our results with established patterns in the relative abundance of these species around O'ahu suggests that species with wide physiological niche boundaries like M. capitata and M. flabellata might be expected to do better under predicted future ocean conditions and outcompete species such as P. evermanni and P. meandrina, making them potential candidates for coral conservation efforts.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"McLachlan, RH (Corresponding Author), Ohio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, 125 South Oval Mall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.

This phenomenon, known as coral bleaching, is one of the major threats affecting coral reefs around the world. Because an important molecular trigger to bleaching appears related to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), it is critical to understand the function of the antioxidant network of Symbiodinium species. In this study we investigated the response of two Symbiodinium species, from contrasting environments, to a chemically induced oxidative stress. ROS produced during this oxidative burst reduced photosynthesis by 30 to 50\% and significantly decreased the activity of superoxide dismutase. Lipid peroxidation levels and carotenoid concentrations, especially diatoxanthin, confirm that these molecules act as antioxidants and contribute to the stabilization of membrane lipids. The comparative analysis between the two Symbiodinium species allowed us to highlight that Symbiodinium sp. clade A temperate was more tolerant to oxidative stress than the tropical S. kawagutii clade F. These differences are very likely a consequence of adaptation to their natural environment, with the temperate species experiencing conditions of temperature and irradiance much more variable and extreme.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Roberty, S (Corresponding Author), Univ Liege, InBioS Anim Physiol, Dept Biol Ecol \& Evolut, 4 Chemin Vallee, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.

However, whether it has occurred in the past in times of thermal stress remains unclear. Moreover, an understanding of historic coral bleaching events would greatly improve our insight into the adaptive capabilities of corals under such stresses. It is known that Porites corals, a massive coral, have relatively high levels of symbiotic zooxanthellae and a strong thermal tolerance when compared with most other corals (and particularly branched corals). Thus, growth hiatuses and/or mortality surfaces of fossil Porites may be used to indicate past ecological or environmental stress events, such as severe bleaching. In this study, monthly geochemical and isotopic environmental proxies of four fossil Porites corals with well-preserved growth hiatuses and mortality surfaces (aged 3,800-4,200years before 2013A.D.), collected from Wenchang fringing reef, Hainan Island, Northern South China Sea were analyzed. Specifically, the Sr/Ca, O-18, and C-13 were measured with a monthly resolution for each sample. These environmental proxies were used to reconstruct the sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), and physiological activity of the coral at the time when the growth hiatuses and/or mortality surfaces occurred. These data were subsequently used to determine the causes of coral mortality and growth discontinuity in each case. The results show that growth hiatuses and mortalities mainly occurred in summer, with high SST (31-34 degrees C) and SSS (32.8-38.4). In addition, abrupt negative shifts of 2-3 in C-13 were observed in almost all of the surfaces of growth hiatus and mortality, indicating a dramatically reduced level of photosynthetic activity in symbiotic zooxanthellae. Because of the above reasons, we conclude that the frequently observed mortality and growth discontinuity of Porites corals from the mid-Holocene is evidence for thermal bleaching events in the past. That is, coral bleaching has occurred 3,800-4,200years ago and is not a new phenomenon. Plain Language Summary We carried out this pilot study to explore the possible response of coral to generally warm conditions in prehistoric periods. Four massive Porites coral fossils that died 3800-4200 years ago were collected from the Wenchang fringing reef, Hainan Island, Northern South China Sea. Our research shows that mortalities of Porites corals frequently occurred and they were caused by dramatically reduced photosynthesis activity of symbiotic zooxanthellae under the stresses of high thermal and saline conditions. The death of Porites corals means the occurrence of coral bleaching. The proof of thermal bleaching in the mid-Holocene indicates that coral bleaching events are not a new ecological phenomena and it may be a recurrent natural phenomenon.",AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",English,"Yu, KF (Corresponding Author), Guangxi Univ, Coral Reef Res Ctr China, Nanning, Peoples R China.

Here, we explored, from macro-to nano-scale, the skeletal structural and compositional characteristics of three coral species belonging to the genus Balanophyllia having different trophic strategies. The goal is to address whether the onset of mixotrophy influenced the skeletal features of B. elegans, B. regia, and B. europaea. The macroscale data suggest that the presence of symbiotic algae in B. europaea can lead to a surplus of energy input that increases its growth rate and skeletal bulk density, leading to larger and denser corals compared to the azooxanthellate ones, B. regia and B. elegans. The symbiosis would also explain the higher intra-skeletal organic matrix (OM) content, which is constituted by macromolecules promoting the calcification, in B. europaea compared to the azooxanthellate species. The characterization of the soluble OM also revealed differences between B. europaea and the azooxanthellate species, which may be linked to diverse macromolecular machineries responsible for skeletal biosynthesis and final morphology. Differently, the crystallographic features were homogenous among species, suggesting that the basic building blocks of skeletons remained a conserved trait in these related species, regardless of the trophic strategy. These results show changes in skeletal phenotype that could be triggered by the onset of mixotrophy, as a consequence of the symbiotic association, displaying remarkable plasticity of coral skeletons which repeatedly allowed this coral group to adapt to a range of changing environments throughout its geological history.

Reduced coral growth at elevated pCO(2) may be buffered by sufficiently high irradiances; however, the interactive effects of OA and irradiance on other fundamental aspects of coral physiology, such as the composition and energetics of coral biomass, remain largely unexplored. This study tested the effects of two light treatments (7.5 versus 15.7 mol photonsm(-2) d(-1)) at ambient or elevated pCO(2) (435 versus 957 mu atm) on calcification, photopigment and symbiont densities, biomass reserves (lipids, carbohydrates, proteins), and biomass energy content (kJ) of the reef coral Pocillopora acuta from Kane `ohe Bay, Hawai'. While pCO(2) and light had no effect on either area-or biomass-normalized calcification, tissue lipids gdw(-1) and kJ gdw(-1) were reduced 15\% and 14\% at high pCO(2), and carbohydrate content increased 15\% under high light. The combination of high light and high pCO(2) reduced protein biomass (per unit area) by approximately 20\%. Thus, under ecologically relevant irradiances, P. acuta in Kane'ohe Bay does not exhibit OA-driven reductions in calcification reported for other corals; however, reductions in tissue lipids, energy content and protein biomass suggest OA induced an energetic deficit and compensatory catabolism of tissue biomass. The null effects of OA on calcification at two irradiances support a growing body of work concluding some reef corals may be able to employ compensatory physiological mechanisms that maintain present-day levels of calcification under OA. However, negative effects of OA on P. acuta biomass composition and energy content may impact the long-term performance and scope for growth of this species in a high pCO(2) world.",ROYAL SOC,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",English,"Wall, CB (Corresponding Author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Sch Ocean \& Earth Sci \& Technol, POB 1346, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.

Understanding host-symbiont associations are critical for assessing coral's habitat requirements and its response to environmental changes. Cladocopium (formerly family Symbiodiniaceae clade C) are dominant endosymbionts in the reef-building coral, Mussismilia braziliensis. This study aimed to investigate the effect of temperature on the biochemical and cellular features of Cladocopium. Heat stress increased oxygen (O-2) and decreased proteins, pigments (Chla + Chlc2), hexadecanoic acid- methyl ester, methyl stearate, and octadecenoic acid (Z)- methyl ester molecules. In addition, there was an increase in neutral lipids such as esterified cholesterol and a decrease in free fatty acids that may have been incorporated for the production of lipid droplets. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated that Cladocopium cells subjected to heat stress had thinner cell walls, deformation of chloroplasts, and increased lipid droplets after 3 days at 28 degrees C.

Elevated H2O2 production by the symbiotic algae during stress may result in symbiosis breakdown and bleaching of the coral. We have recently reported that various Red Sea corals release H2O2 and antioxidants to their external milieu, and can influence the H2O2 dynamics in the reef. Here, we present a laboratory characterization of H2O2 and antioxidant activity release kinetics by intact, non-stressed Stylophora pistillata. Experimenting with bleached and non-bleached corals and different stirring speeds, we explored the sources and modes of H2O2 and antioxidant release. Since H2O2 is produced and degraded simultaneously, we developed a methodology for resolving the actual H2O2 concentrations released by the corals. H2O2 and antioxidant activity steadily increased in the water surrounding the coral over short periods of 1-2 h. Over longer periods of 5-7 h, the antioxidant activity kept increasing with time, while H2O2 concentrations were stabilized at similar to 1 mu M by 1-3 h, and then gradually declined. Solving for H2O2 release, corals were found to release H2O2 at increasing rates over 2-4 h, and then to slow down and stop by 5-7 h. Stirring was shown to induce the release of H2O2, possibly since the flow reduces the thickness of the diffusive boundary layer of the coral, and thus increases H2O2 mass flux. Antioxidant activity was released at similar rates by bleached and non-bleached corals, suggesting that the antioxidants did not originate from the symbiotic algae. H2O2, however, was not released from bleached corals, implying that the symbiotic algae are the source of the released H2O2. The observed flow-induced H2O2 release may aid corals in removing some of the internal H2O2 produced by their symbiotic algae, and may possibly assist in preventing coral bleaching under conditions of elevated temperature and irradiance.",COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",English,"Armoza-Zvuloni, R (Corresponding Author), Interuniv Inst Marine Sci, IL-88103 Elat, Israel.

On Ofu Island, American Samoa, we investigated day-night differences in gene expression under field conditions of changing pH, temperature, light, and oxygen. Using RNASeq techniques, we compared two replicate transcriptomes from a single coral colony of Acropora hyacinthus over six noons and five midnights. We identified 344 contigs with significant expression differences across 16,800 contigs in the transcriptome, most with small fold-changes. However, there were 21 contigs with fold-changes ranging from 10 to 141. The largest changes were in a set of transcription factors strongly associated with day-night gene regulation in other animals, including cryptochromes, thyrotroph embryonic factor, and D site-binding protein. We also found large daytime increases in a set of genes involved in glucose transport and glycogen storage. We found small expression differences in genes associated with aerobic ATP production and hypoxia response, along with slightly higher expression of most calcification genes at noon. Although similar to 40-fold-changes in expression occur in important transcription factors, downstream gene regulation seems very stable in corals from day to night compared to other animals studied.",UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",English,"Ruiz-Jones, LJ (Corresponding Author), Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Dept Biol, 120 Oceanview Blvd, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA.

Herein, we provide evidence that during the earliest stages of environmentally induced bleaching, heat stress and light stress generate distinctly different pathomorphological changes in the chloroplasts, while a combined heat-and light-stress exposure induces both pathomorphologies; suggesting that these stressors act on the dinoflagellate by different mechanisms. Within the first 48 hours of a heat stress (32 degrees C) under low-light conditions, heat stress induced decomposition of thylakoid structures before observation of extensive oxidative damage; thus it is the disorganization of the thylakoids that creates the conditions allowing photo-oxidative-stress. Conversely, during the first 48 hours of a light stress (2007 mmoles m(-2) s(-1) PAR) at 25 degrees C, condensation or fusion of multiple thylakoid lamellae occurred coincidently with levels of oxidative damage products, implying that photo-oxidative stress causes the structural membrane damage within the chloroplasts. Exposure to combined heat-and light-stresses induced both pathomorphologies, confirming that these stressors acted on the dinoflagellate via different mechanisms. Within 72 hours of exposure to heat and/or light stresses, homeostatic processes (e. g., heat-shock protein and anti-oxidant enzyme response) were evident in the remaining intact dinoflagellates, regardless of the initiating stressor.

To acquire carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, many marine autotrophs rely on the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) to catalyze the conversion of bicarbonate ions, (HCO3-) to CO2. In zoanthids and other cnidarians with Symbiodinium spp. endosymbionts, CA is essential for transporting CO2 to symbionts for photosynthesis. Temperature and ambient DIC affect CA activity, therefore, increased sea water temperatures and ocean acidification (OA) will alter CO2 transport in symbiotic cnidarians. However, these effects are likely to be species specific for both host and symbiont, as different cnidarians and Symbiodinium spp. vary in their mechanisms of DIC transport and utilization of CA. In this study, host and symbiont CA activity in the zoanthids Palythoa sp. and Zoanthus sp. varied with thermal stress and low pH. Increased temperature inhibited algal, but not host CA activity in Zoanthus sp. polyps with A4 Symbiodinium, while temperature had no effect on CA activity in Palythoa sp. with Cl Symbiodinium. High pCO(2)/low pH altered algal CA activity in both zoanthid species, but host CA activity changed in Zoanthus sp. polyps only. This study shows that thermal stress and OA induce species-specific changes in CA activity, and thus DIC transport in symbiotic zoanthids. These observations suggest that CA activity in symbiotic cnidarians will be altered by climate conditions predicted for the future, and for some cnidarians, changes in CA activity may inhibit photosynthesis.

This study aims to examine the physiological changes happening in two reef-building coral species exposed to thermal stress under various light conditions. The two ecologically relevant heatwave scenarios were applied under ambient lights (high irradiance) and reduced light conditions (250 and < 10 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)). Corals were exposed to elevated temperatures of 32 degrees C (plus 6 degrees) for a period of 1 up to 5 days corresponding to heatwaves reported on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) that were associated with coral bleaching. We monitored changes in the physiological performance of these two coral species by measuring symbionts and corals' physiological parameters including symbiont density, levels of multiple algal pigments (chlorophyll a and peridinin), as well as the changes in the host protein concentration. During the short-term heat stress, both species were with stable physiological performance with the only exception of Stylophora pistillata under ambient lights. These results show that S. pistillata was negatively influenced by a synergistic effect of temperature and high irradiance resulting in the first signs of bleaching after only 24h of thermal stress. Exposure to prolonged thermal stress, characterised with a slower rate of temperature increase, affected both coral species investigated and resulted in bleaching mainly by day 5. Interestingly, severe light reduction (<10 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) made Acropora millepora corals more thermally sensitive and resulted in earlier signs of bleaching (on day 3). These findings indicate that there was a synergistic effect of very low lights and thermal stress that caused higher levels of bleaching in A. millepora.

We demonstrate that the effective yield of PSII (Delta F/F-m `) is significantly underestimated when using short inductions times (<= 1 min) following the rapid light curve protocol (RLC). The consequent electron transport rates (ETR) underestimations are species-specific and highly variable with irradiance and the photoacclimatory condition of the sample. Our analysis also questions the use of relative descriptors (relETR), as they not only overestimate photosynthesis, but overlook one of the fundamental components of the photosynthetic response: light absorption regulation. Absorptance determinations were fundamental to characterise the ETR response of low-pigmented seagrass leaves, and also uncovered relevant differences between two coral species and the accclimatory response of a cultured dinoflagellate to temperature. ETR and oxygen evolution determinations showed close correlations for all organisms tested with the expected slope of 4 e(-) per O-2 molecule evolved, when correct photosynthesis inductions and light absorption determinations were applied. However, ETR curves cannot be equated to conventional photosynthetic response to irradiance (P vs E) curves, and caution is needed when using ETR to characterise photosynthesis rates above photosynthesis saturation (E-k). This validation strongly supports the utility of fluorescence tools, underlining the need to correct two decades of propagation of erroneous concepts, protocols and parameters in marine eco-physiology. We aim also to emphasise the importance of optical descriptions for understanding photosynthesis, and for interpreting fluorescence measurements. In combination with conventional gross photosynthesis (GPS) approaches, optical characterisations open an extraordinary opportunity to determine two central parameters of photosynthesis performance: the quantum yield ((max)) of the process and its minimum quantum requirements (1/(max)). The combination of both approaches potentiates the possibilities of chlorophyll a fluorescence tools to characterise marine photosynthesis biodiversity.",CSIRO PUBLISHING,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",English,"EnrÃ­quez, S (Corresponding Author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Lab Photobiol Coral Reef Primary Producers, Unidad Acad Sistemas Arrecifales Puerto Morelos, Apartado Postal 13, Cancun 77500, Mexico.

Reef-dwelling large benthic foraminifera (LBF) are particularly sensitive to changes in light exposure, but their cryptic behaviour allows them to colonise different habitats across a light gradient. Yet, how foraminifera of the same species that live in different habitats respond to variations in light conditions, and the physiological and morphological attributes that govern that response, remain unclear. Here, we investigate how Amphistegina lobifera, a common and abundant LBF species in reef environments, collected from different reef sites across a light gradient, respond to changing light levels under lab-controlled conditions. Reduced light below their optimum level for growth and calcification caused a significant reduction in antioxidant capacity, and a significant decline in the density of newly added chambers. In contrast, elevated light caused significant reduction in survivorship, induced bleaching and photo-oxidative stress, and caused thickening of external chambers. Reef site did not have a significant effect on most of the responses, and populations collected from different reef sites showed similar sensitivity to changes in irradiance below and above their optimum level. The capacity to regulate symbiont density and to host a diversity of symbiotic diatoms within Amphistegina could be a reason for their ability to acclimate rapidly to different light levels. However, prolonged exposure to reduced light may result in a decrease in shell density and, as a consequence, a decline in carbonate production in reef environments.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",English,"Prazeres, M (Corresponding Author), Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.

During April and May 2006, corals were acclimatized for 15 days to cool (25.7A degrees C) or ambient (27.7A degrees C) temperature, under shaded (352 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) or ambient (554 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) natural light, and then incubated for 7 days at ambient or high temperature (31.1A degrees C), under ambient light (659 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)). The response to acclimatization was assessed as biomass, maximum dark-adapted quantum yield of PSII (F (v)/F (m)), and growth, and the effect of the subsequent treatment was assessed as F (v)/F (m) and growth. Relative to the controls (i.e., ambient temperature/ambient light), massive Porites spp. responded to acclimatization through increases in biomass under ambient temperature/shade, and low temperature/ambient light, whereas P. irregularis responded through reduced growth under ambient temperature/shade, and low temperature/ambient light. Acclimatization affected the response to thermal stress for massive Porites spp. (but not P. irregularis), with an interaction between the acclimatization and subsequent treatments for growth. This interaction resulted from a lessening of the negative effects of high temperature after acclimatizing to ambient temperature/shade, but an accentuation of the effect after acclimatizing to low temperature/shade. It is possible that changes in biomass for massive Porites spp. are important in modulating the response to high temperature, with the taxonomic variation in this effect potentially resulting from differences in morphology. These results demonstrate that corals can acclimatize during short exposures to downward excursions in temperature and light, which subsequently affects their response to thermal stress. Moreover, even con-generic taxa differ in this capacity, which could affect coral community structure.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",English,"Edmunds, PJ (Corresponding Author), Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, 18111 Nordhoff St, Northridge, CA 91330 USA.

These associations are widespread in the phyla Porifera (sponges) and Cnidaria (corals, sea anemones etc.) but otherwise uncommon or absent from animal phyla. It is suggested that one factor contributing to the distribution of animal symbioses is the morphologically-simple body plan of the Porifera and Cnidaria with a large surface area:volume relationship well-suited to light capture by symbiotic algae in their tissues. Photosynthetic products are released from living symbiont cells to the animal host at substantial rates. Research with algal cells freshly isolated from the symbioses suggests that low molecular weight compounds (e.g. maltose, glycerol) are the major release products but further research is required to assess the relevance of these results to the algae in the intact symbiosis. Photosynthesis also poses risks for the animal because environmental perturbations, especially elevated temperature or irradiance, can lead to the production of reactive oxygen species, damage to membranes and proteins, and `bleaching', including breakdown of the symbiosis. The contribution of non-photochemical quenching and membrane lipid composition of the algae to bleaching susceptibility is assessed.

The genus Symbiodinium contains nine clades, some of which behave differently in response to strong light and/or temperature stresses, for example, clade D Symbiodinium are thermally tolerant. However, previous studies are based on corals present in the field, and it is possible that the corals used in previous experiments did not contain single Symbiodinium clades. For an accurate assessment of the effects of each Symbiodinium clade on host thermal stress resistance, monoclonal cultures of clades C1 and D were inoculated into aposymbiotic juvenile polyps. Photosynthetic efficiency (maximum quantum yield: F-v/F-m) showed a decline at 30 degrees C than at 25 degrees C in both clades. Symbiodinium clade C1 showed a consistently higher rETRmax with larger fluctuations than clade D, with a lower survival rate of juveniles during thermal stress treatment. Under strong light exposure, corals containing clade C1 showed a greater decline in F-v/F-m (-74\%), compared to decline in corals associated with clade D (-50\%) after 3 hours. This is the first study to assess stress tolerances of juvenile corals in association with the monoclonal Symbiodinium clades C and D, and our results indicated greater tolerance of corals associated with clade D to strong light (500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). However, it is difficult to determine the impact of high-temperature stress on coral-algae symbiosis from photosynthetic activity. At high temperatures, clade C1 Symbiodinium exhibited high photosynthetic activity, but host survival rates were higher in corals associated with clade D Symbiodinium. Since clade C1 has a relatively high photosynthetic activity under high temperatures, clade C1 symbiosis at high temperatures might have a negative impact on corals compared with clade D.","BIODIVERSITY RESEARCH CENTER, ACAD SINICA","128 ACADEMIA RODA, SECTION 2, NANKANG, TAIPEI, 11529, TAIWAN",English,"Yuyama, I (Corresponding Author), Natl Inst Genet, Ctr Informat Biol, 1111 Yata, Mishima, Shizuoka 4118540, Japan.

The function of the carbon-fixing enzyme ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) in dinoflagellates is difficult to study because its activity is rapidly lost after extraction from the cell. We report procedures for the extraction of Rubisco from Symbiodinium cells and for stable storage. We describe a continuous assay for Rubisco activity in these crude cell extracts using the Mn2+ chemiluminescence of Rubisco oxygenase. Chemiluminescence time courses exhibited initial transients resembling bacterial Form II Rubisco, followed by several minutes of linearly decreasing activity. The initial activity was determined from extrapolation of this linear section of the time course. The activity of fast-frozen cell extracts was stable at -80 degrees C and, after thawing and storage on ice, remained stable for up to 1 h before declining non-linearly. Crude cell extracts bound {[}14C] 2-carboxy-D-arabitinol 1,5-bisphosphate to a high molecular mass fraction separable by gel filtration chromatography.

This work studies the photosynthetic characteristics of E. timida from a lagoon environment (Mar Menor), defined between 25 and 600 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1) by the photosynthetic-irradiance curve. Experimental data were fitted to different exponential models and models based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Among the latter, the model that bests fits to the experimental data was identified. Furthermore, it incorporates respiration values and allows an estimation of compensation irradiance (I-c: 11.89 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)). This model showed a rapid saturation of the photosynthetic apparatus at relatively low irradiance values (I-k: 31.33 mu mol quanta m(-2)). Excess light seems to be modulated by the mollusc's opening and closing of their parapodia. Mean P/R values (Production versus Respiration relationship) are above 0.91; considered high in coral-zooxanthellae symbioses.

It is highly likely that hosting a more heat-tolerant algal genotype will be accompanied by tradeoffs in the physiology of the coral. To better understand one of these tradeoffs, growth was investigated in the Indo-Pacific reef-building coral Acropora millepora in both the laboratory and the field. In the Keppel Islands in the southern Great Barrier Reef this species naturally harbors nrDNA ITS1 thermally sensitive type C2 or thermally tolerant type D zooxanthellae of the genus Symbiodinium and can change dominant type following bleaching. We show that under controlled conditions, corals with type D symbionts grow 29\% slower than those with type C2 symbionts. In the field, type D colonies grew 38\% slower than C2 colonies. These results demonstrate the magnitude of trade-offs likely to be experienced by this species as they acclimatize to warmer conditions by changing to more thermally tolerant type D zooxanthellae. Irrespective of symbiont genotype, corals were affected to an even greater degree by the stress of a bleaching event which reduced growth by more than 50\% for up to 18 months compared to pre-bleaching rates. The processes of symbiont change and acute thermal stress are likely to act in concert on coral growth as reefs acclimatize to more stressful warmer conditions, further compromising their regeneration capacity following climate change.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"185 BERRY ST, STE 1300, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94107 USA",English,"Jones, A (Corresponding Author), Cent Queensland Univ, Ctr Environm Management, Rockhampton, Qld 4702, Australia.

Adaptation in capacity to harvest and utilize light, and ``safely{'' process photosynthetically generated energy is a key factor regulating their broad ecological success. However, whether such adaptive capacity similarly extends to how Symbiodiniaceae species and genotypes assimilate inorganic carbon (Ci) remains unexplored. We build on recent approaches exploring functional diversity of fitness traits to identify whether Ci uptake and incorporation could be reconciled with evolutionary adaptation among Symbiodiniaceae. We examined phylogenetically diverse Symbiodiniaceae cultures (23 isolates, 6 genera) to track how carbon was invested into cellular uptake, excretion, and growth (cell size, division, storage). Gross carbon uptake rates (GPC) over 1 h varied among isolates grown at 26 degrees C (0.63-3.08 pg C {[}cell h](-1)) with no evident pattern with algal phylogeny. Intriguingly, net carbon uptake rates (24 h) were often higher (1.01-5.54 pg C {[}cell h](-1)) than corresponding values of GPC-we discuss how such GPC measurements may reflect highly conserved biological characteristics for cultured cells linked to high metabolic dependency on photorespiration and heterotrophy. Three isolates from different genera (Cladocopium goreaui, Durusdinium trenchii, and Effrenium voratum) were additionally grown at 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C. Here, Ci uptake consistently decreased with temperature-driven declines in growth rate, suggesting environmental regulation outweighs phylogenetic organization of carbon assimilation capacity among Symbiodiniaceae. Together, these data demonstrate environmental regulation and ecological success among Symbiodiniaceae likely rests on plasticity of upstream photosynthetic processes (light harvesting, energy quenching, etc.) to overcome evolutionary-conserved limitations in Ci functioning.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Suggett, DJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Technol Sydney, Climate Change Cluster, Broadway, NSW, Australia.

Cultures of two Symbiodinium sp. and one Cladocopium sp. were exposed to a stepwise increase in temperature (2 \& DEG;C every second day) ranging from 26 \& DEG;C (modal temperature in Abrolhos) to 32 \& DEG;C (just above the maximum temperature registered in Abrolhos during the third global bleaching event-TGBE). After the cultures reached their final testing temperature, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, single cell attributes (relative cell size and chlorophyll fluorescence), and photosynthetic efficiency (effective (Y(II)) and maximum (F-v/F-m) quantum yields) were measured within 4 h and 72 h. Non-photochemical coefficient (NPQ) was estimated based on fluorescence values. Population average ROS production was variable across strains and exposure times, reaching up a 2-fold increase at 32 \& DEG;C in one of the Symbiodinium sp. strains. A marked intrapopulation difference was observed in ROS production, with 5 to 25\% of the cells producing up to 10 times more than the population average, highlighting the importance of single cell approaches to assess population physiology. Average cell size increases at higher temperatures, likely resulting from cell cycle arrest, whereas chlorophyll fluorescence decreased, especially in 4 h, indicating a photoacclimation response. The conditions tested do not seem to have elicited loss of photosynthetic efficiency nor the activation of non-photochemical mechanisms in the cells. Our results unveiled a generalized thermotolerance in three Symbiodiniaceae strains originated from Abrolhos' corals.

The coral Acropora millepora was 3- to 10-fold more sensitive to the three herbicides than the CCA Neogoniolithon fosliei. While the photosynthesis of CCA was not affected by the herbicide concentrations used (< 1 mu g L-1), temperatures of 31 degrees C and 32 degrees C alone significantly inhibited photosynthetic efficiency (Delta F: F-m') and caused chronic photoinhibition (reduced F-v : F-m) and substantial bleaching. Environmentally relevant concentrations of each herbicide increased the negative effects of thermal stress on coral at 31 degrees C and 32 degrees C. Mixed model analyses of variance showed that the effects of elevated sea surface temperatures (SST) and herbicide on photosynthetic efficiency of coral symbionts were additive. Furthermore, the effect of either diuron or atrazine in combination with higher SST (31 degrees C and 32 degrees C) on chronic photoinhibition was distinctly greater than additive (synergistic). Reducing the herbicide concentration by 1 mu g L-1 diuron above 30 degrees C would protect photosynthetic efficiency by the equivalent of 1.8 degrees C and reduce chronic photoinhibition by the equivalent of a 1 degrees C reduction.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process still need more investigations. Symbiosis breakdown is known to result from physiological damage to animal host cells and/or symbionts. Cellular oxidation appears to be an essential player in this damage. Indeed, oxidative stress is a direct consequence of increase in irradiance and temperature, the two main environmental factors involved in bleaching. In this study, we examined the role of irradiance in inducing dissociation and oxidative stress in cnidarians and dinoflagellates. We used the bleaching-sensitive scleractinian coral Pocillopora verrucosa in a field cross-transplantation experiment performed between 5 in and 20 in depth at Grande Glorieuse Island (Indian Ocean), a preserved area subject to minimal anthropogenic influence. Cellular damage and increase in antioxidant defense were correlated with bleaching in upward transplanted samples. Downward transplanted colonies presented no associated alterations similar to the controls. We therefore conclude that increasing light induced bleaching via a prooxidative period. Remarkably, the distribution of Symbiodinium over depth was invariant; all colonies were monomorph for clade C, suggesting that bleaching sensitivity of R verrucosa might not be associated with clade specificity.

The lowest values of all tissue biomass and algal symbiont parameters occurred during the late summer-fall sample periods. In contrast, the highest densities and pigment content of symbionts usually occurred during the winter, whereas tissue biomass peaked most often in the spring, the time lag implying a functional relationship between these variables. Corals living in shallow water often (but not always) had higher levels of all parameters measured compared to deeper corals, except chlorophyll a content, which usually displayed the opposite trend. The results show that corals from all depths exhibited bleaching (loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates and/or their pigments) every year, regardless of whether they appeared white, tan, or mottled to the human eye.

Photoprotective mechanisms of the symbiont can reduce the excitation pressure impinging upon PSII. In the bleaching sensitive species, Acropora millepora and Pocillopora damicornis, high light alone induced photoprotection through the xanthophyll cycle, increased content of the antioxidant carotenoid, beta-carotene, as well as the dissociation of the light-harvesting chlorophyll complexes. The evidence is compatible with either the membrane-bound chlorophyll a-chlorophyll c (2)-peridinin-protein (acpPC) complex or the peripheral peridinin-chlorophyll-protein complex, or both, disconnecting from PSII under high light. The acpPC complex potentially showed a state transition response with redistribution towards photosystem I to reduce PSII over-excitation. This apparent acpPC dissociation/reassociation was promoted by the addition of the xanthophyll cycle inhibitor, dithiothreitol, under high irradiance. Exposure to thermal stress as well as high light promoted xanthophyll de-epoxidation and increased beta-carotene content, although it did not influence light-harvesting chlorophyll complex (LHC) dissociation, indicating light, rather than temperature, controls LHC dissociation. Photoinhibition was avoided in the bleaching tolerant species, Pavona decussata, suggesting xanthophyll cycling along with LHC dissociation may have been sufficient to prevent photodamage to PSII. Symbionts of P. decussata also displayed the greatest detachment of antenna complexes, while the more thermally sensitive species, Pocillopora damicornis and A. millepora, showed less LHC dissociation, suggesting antenna movement influences bleaching susceptibility.",SPRINGER,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",English,"Hill, R (Corresponding Author), Univ New S Wales, Ctr Marine Bioinnovat, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.

A comparative, biochemical approach under a simulated scenario of climate change",CORAL REEFS,2022,41,1,213-222,FEB,"The Southwestern Atlantic (SWA) corals are more tolerant to global warming than those from the Caribbean Sea, possibly due to their higher heterotrophy and flexibility of symbiotic associations in nutrient-rich waters. Increased heterotrophy promotes greater energy gain via increased mitochondrial respiration, which can be used to face unfavorable conditions. Citrate synthase (CS) is a pacemaker enzyme of cellular respiration, and its activity can be used as a proxy for maximum aerobic capacity, thus being a potential predictor of organism tolerance against climate change. Therefore, we hypothesized that endemic coral species from SWA would have higher CS activity than those of pan-Caribbean distribution after exposure to a simulated scenario of moderate climate change (seawater temperature increase: + 2.5 degrees C; seawater acidification: - 0.3 pH unit), according to IPCC. Seven species of scleractinian corals and one hydrocoral species were biochemically evaluated in a phylogenetic perspective. Favia gravida, Mussismilia harttii, Montastraea cavernosa, Porites astreoides and Siderastrea stellata were unresponsive regarding CS activity, whereas Millepora alcicornis, Mussismilia hispida and Porites branneri showed a compensatory effect. Regardless of their phylogenetic relationships, endemic SWA coral species revealed higher CS activity than those of pan-Caribbean distribution. We suggest that the unique evolutionary history of SWA endemic species contributes to their biochemical tolerance to climate change, thus supporting the hypothesis of SWA as a refuge for reef life. Although CS is not a suitable biomarker for assessing the putative effects of climate change owing to its species-specific responses, it is an informative metric to indicate stress tolerance of species with different biogeographic origins. This idea becomes particularly evident for SWA reefs, where such a comparative, biochemical approach highlights the greater tolerance of endemic species at the subcellular level of organization.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"Angonese, MS (Corresponding Author), Univ Fed Rio Grande, Inst Oceanog, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.

In this study, the effects of elevated seawater temperature and partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) on subtropical sediment systems of mangrove, seagrass, and coral reef lagoon habitats of Okinawa, Japan, were examined. Sediment and seawater from each habitat were exposed to four pCO(2)-temperature treatments, including ambient pCO(2)- ambient temperature, ambient pCO(2)-high temperature (ambient temperature + 4 degrees C), high pCO(2) (936 ppm)-ambient temperature, and high pCO(2)-high temperature. Parameters including primary production, nutrient flux, pigment content, photosynthetic community composition, and bacterial abundance were examined. Neither high temperature nor high pCO(2) alone impacted mangrove and seagrass sediment primary production significantly (Tukey's test, P > 0.05). However, the combined stress significantly (Tukey's test, P < 0.01) increased primary production in these two habitats. In sediments from the coral reef lagoon, single and combined stress treatments induced a shift from heterotrophy to autotrophy. Significant increases in net primary production (Tukey's test, P < 0.01), and gross primary production (Tukey's test, P < 0.05) under the combined stress suggested that benthic microalgae in mangrove and seagrass sediments were more responsive to high temperature and pCO(2) conditions than those in coral reef lagoon sediments. Additionally, combined stress significantly increased the sediment chlorophyll a content (Tukey's test, P < 0.05) in all habitats. These increases were associated with increased net primary production, indicating that combined stress stimulates primary production activity by the photosynthetic benthic microalgae in all habitats. Diatom activity increased, as silicate uptake increased in all habitats. Microbial abundance significantly increased under the combined stress treatment (Tukey's test, P < 0.01), but did not exceed autotrophic activity. Respiration did not change significantly in any of the three habitats (Tukey's test, P > 0.05) under the combined stress, suggesting that heterotrophic processes were less affected by the combined stress than autotrophic processes. In summary, mangrove and seagrass sediments minimize the negative impacts of elevated temperature and pCO(2) via increased primary production and carbon storage.

The sea anemone, Exaiptasia diaphana, is a popular coral model, but the response of its bacteria to thermal stress has been barely explored. To address this, we compared the bacterial communities of Great Barrier Reef (GBR) E. diaphana maintained at 26 degrees C or exposed to increasing temperature (26-33 degrees C) over two weeks. Communities were analyzed by metabarcoding of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Bleaching and Symbiodiniaceae health were assessed by Symbiodiniaceae cell density and dark-adapted quantum yield (F-v/F-m), respectively. Significant bleaching and reductions in F-v/F-m occurred in the heat-treated anemones above 29 degrees C. Overall declines in bacterial alpha diversity in all anemones were also observed. Signs of bacterial change emerged above 31 degrees C. Some initial outcomes may have been influenced by relocation or starvation, but collectively, the bacterial community and taxa-level data suggested that heat was the primary driver of change above 32 degrees C. Six bacterial indicator species were identified as potential biomarkers for thermal stress.

H.",Thermal and Herbicide Tolerances of Chromerid Algae and Their Ability to Form a Symbiosis With Corals,FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2019,10,NA,NA,12-Feb,"Reef-building corals form an obligate symbiosis with photosynthetic microalgae in the family Symbiodiniaceae that meet most of their energy requirements. This symbiosis is under threat from the unprecedented rate of ocean warming as well as the simultaneous pressure of local stressors such as poor water quality. Only 1 degrees C above mean summer sea surface temperatures (SSTs) on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) can trigger the loss of Symbiodiniaceae from the host, and very low concentrations of the most common herbicide, diuron, can disrupt the photosynthetic activity of microalgae. In an era of rapid environmental change, investigation into the assisted evolution of the coral holobiont is underway in an effort to enhance the resilience of corals. Apicomplexan-like microalgae were discovered in 2008 and the Phylum Chromerida (chromerids) was created. Chromerids have been isolated from corals and contain a functional photosynthetic plastid. Their discovery therefore opens a new avenue of research into the use of alternative/additional photosymbionts of corals. However, only two studies to-date have investigated the symbiotic nature of Chromera velia with corals and thus little is known about the coral-chromerid relationship. Furthermore, the response of chromerids to environmental stressors has not been examined. Here we tested the performance of four chromerid strains and the common dinofiagellate symbiont Cladocopium goreaui (formerly Symbiodinium goreaui, ITS2 type C1) in response to elevated temperature, diuron and their combined exposure. Three of the four chromerid strains exhibited high thermal tolerances and two strains showed exceptional herbicide tolerances, greater than observed for any photosynthetic microalgae, including C. goreaui. We also investigated the onset of symbiosis between the chromerids and larvae of two common GBR coral species under ambient and stress conditions. Levels of colonization of coral larvae with the chromerid strains were low compared to colonization with C. goreaui. We did not observe any overall negative or positive larval fitness effects of the inoculation with chromerid algae vs. C. goreaui. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that chromerid algae may have more important roles in later coral life stages and recommend this be the focus of future studies.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",English,"Chakravarti, LJ (Corresponding Author), Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia.

During sunny days, photosynthetic carbon (C) production rates of C. caespitosa can be as high as those measured for tropical corals and rapidly follow changes in natural irradiance (from 200 to 1000 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) within 2 h). As a consequence, daily production rates varied by a factor of 2 (from 150 and 260 mu g C cm(-2) d(-1)) depending on the irradiance received. Under high irradiance levels, corals can suffer from photoinhibition (light-induced reduction in the photosynthetic capacity), especially temperate species, which do not experience high irradiance levels most of the year. However, in C. caespitosa, photoinhibition at irradiances higher than 1000 mmol photons m(-2) s(-1) was reduced as a result of the involvement of the xanthophyll cycle, with a degree comparable to those measured for tropical species (de-epoxidation ratio of 0.12), that allowed C. caespitosa to maintain high production rates and a maximal autotrophic carbon acquisition during sunny days. However, as soon as irradiance conditions decreased below 200 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) because of cloudy weather, autotrophically acquired carbon could not sustain respiratory needs, indicating that C. caespitosa has to rely on other sources, such as heterotrophy, to meet its energetic needs.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Ferrier-PagÃ¨s, C (Corresponding Author), Ctr Sci Monaco, Monaco, Monaco.

However, molecular mechanisms governing these critical processes under ocean warming and acidification are still poorly understood. The present study investigated the interactive impact of elevated temperature (similar to 28.0 degrees C and similar to 30.5 degrees C) and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) (similar to 600 and similar to 1,200 mu atm) on early development and the gene expression patterns in juvenileAcropora intermediaover 33 days. The results showed that coral survival was >89\% and was unaffected by high temperature,pCO(2), or the combined treatment. Notably, high temperature completely arrested successful symbiosis establishment and the budding process, whereas acidification had a negligible effect. Moreover, there was a positive exponential relationship between symbiosis establishment and budding rates (y= 0.0004e(6.43x),R= 0.72,P< 0.0001), which indicated the importance of symbiosis in fueling asexual budding. Compared with corals at the control temperature (28 degrees C), those under elevated temperature preferentially harboredDurusdiniumspp., despite unsuccessful symbiosis establishment. In addition, compared to the control, 351 and 153 differentially expressed genes were detected in the symbiont and coral host in response to experimental conditions, respectively. In coral host, some genes involved in nutrient transportation and tissue fluorescence were affected by high temperature. In the symbionts, a suite of genes related to cell growth, ribosomal proteins, photosynthesis, and energy production was downregulated under high temperatures, which may have severely hampered successful cell proliferation of the endosymbionts and explains the failure of symbiosis establishment. Therefore, our results suggest that the responses of symbionts to future ocean conditions could play a vital role in shaping successful symbiosis in juvenile coral.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",English,"Huang, H (Corresponding Author), Chinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Appl Marine Biol, CAS Key Lab Trop Marine \& Resources \& Ecol, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.

Because of the difficulty of performing laboratory experiments with corals, the sea anemone Aiptasia has emerged as an important model system for molecular studies of coral bleaching and symbiosis. Here, we investigate natural variation in bleaching responses among different genetic lineages of Aiptasia. Both heat- and cold-induced paths to symbiosis breakdown were analyzed. Significant genetic variation in response to acute heat stress was observed, with severe bleaching of two Aiptasia strains from Hawaii but minimal bleaching of strains from the U.S. South Atlantic, including the strain used to generate the Aiptasia reference genome. Both strains from Hawaii hosted Symbiodinium type B1, whereas strains from the U.S. South Atlantic hosted type A4 or B2. In contrast to the results from exposures to acute heat stress, negligible variation was observed in response to a pulsed cold shock despite moderate bleaching across all strains. These results support our hypothesis that bleaching responses to distinct stressors are independent. Our findings emphasize the role of stress regime when predicting adaptive responses of symbiotic cnidarians to changing climates, because genetic variation may exist for some forms of stress-induced bleaching but not others.",UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",English,"Bellis, ES (Corresponding Author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.

But far fewer studies have been done on non-calcifying organisms, such as sponges, that have important ecological roles on coral reefs. Here we report the results of a combined thermal stress and ocean acidification experiment on the ecologically dominant barrel sponge, Xestospongia muta, found on coral reefs throughout the Caribbean basin. The results show that ocean acidification alone, as well as its interaction with elevated seawater temperature, has significant effects on the sponge microbiome. Specifically, the significant interactive effects of thermal stress and ocean acidification led to a decline in the productivity potential of the symbiotic cyanobacteria in these sponges with a subsequent impact on nutrient transfer, as carbohydrate, between symbiont and host Additionally, while neither environmental stressor predictably changed sponge microbiome community composition, ocean acidification alone reduced the stability of sponge microbiomes and their predicted functions. Future changes in ocean acidification and thermal stress predicted by current climate models could negatively impact the microbiomes of coral reef organisms and therefore also affect their organismal performance and fitness in the future.

Depositional features including components, rock textures, lithofacies, platform types and architecture, all vary in space and time, as do the results of diagenetic processes on those primary features. Approaches to the study of carbonate rocks have become progressively more analytical. One focus has evolved from efforts to build reference models for specific Phanerozoic windows to scrutinize the effect of climate and long-term oscillations of the ocean-atmosphere system in influencing the mineralogy of carbonate components. This paper adds to the ongoing lively debates by attempting to understand changes in the predominant types of carbonate-producing organisms during the Mesozoic-Cenozoic, while striving to minimize the uniformitarian bias. Our approach integrates estimates of changes in Ca2+ concentration in seawater and atmospheric CO2, with biological evolution and ecological requirements of characteristic carbonate-producing marine communities. The underlying rationale for our approach is the fact that CO2 is basic to both carbonates and organic matter, and that photosynthesis is a fundamental biological process responsible for both primary production of organic matter and providing chemical environments that promote calcification. Gross photosynthesis and hypercalcification are dependent largely upon sunlight, while net primary production and, e.g., subsequent burial of organic matter typically requires sources of new nutrients (N, P and trace elements). Our approach plausibly explains the changing character of carbonate production as an evolving response to changing environmental conditions driven by the geotectonic cycle, while identifying uncertainties that deserve further research. With metazoan consumer diversity reduced by the end-Permian extinctions, excess photosynthesis by phytoplankton and microbial assemblages in surface waters, induced by moderately high CO2 and temperature during the Early Mesozoic, supported proliferation of non-tissular metazoans (e.g., sponges) and heterotrophic bacteria at the sea floor. Metabolic activity by those microbes, especially sulfate reduction, resulted in abundant biologically-induced geochemical carbonate precipitation on and within the sea floor. For example, with the opening of Tethyan seaways during the Triassic, massive sponge/microbe boundstones (the benthic automicrite factory) formed steep, massive and thick progradational slopes and, locally, mud-mounds. As tectonic processes created shallow epicontinental seas, photosynthesis drove lime-mud precipitation in the illuminated zone of the water column. The resulting neritic lime-mud component of the shallow-water carbonate factory became predominant during the Jurassic, paralleling the increase in atmospheric pCO(2), while the decreasing importance of the benthic automicrite factory parallels the diversification of calcifying metazoans, phytoplankton and zooplankton. With atmospheric pCO(2) declining through the Cretaceous, the potential habitats for neritic lime-mud precipitation declined. At the same time, peak oceanic Ca2+ concentrations promoted biotically-controlled calcification by the skeletal factory. With changes produced by extinctions and turnovers at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, adaptations to decreasing Ca2+ and pCO(2), coupled with increasing global temperature gradients (i.e., high-latitude and deep-water cooling), and strategies that efficiently linked photosynthesis and calcification, promoted successive changes of the dominant skeletal factory through the Cenozoic: larger benthic foraminifers (protist-protist symbiosis) during the Paleogene, red algae during the Miocene and modern coral reefs (metazoan-protist symbiosis) since Late Miocene.

H.",Estimating the Potential for Adaptation of Corals to Climate Warming,PLOS ONE,2010,5,3,NA,18-Mar,"The persistence of tropical coral reefs is threatened by rapidly increasing climate warming, causing a functional breakdown of the obligate symbiosis between corals and their algal photosymbionts (Symbiodinium) through a process known as coral bleaching. Yet the potential of the coral-algal symbiosis to genetically adapt in an evolutionary sense to warming oceans is unknown. Using a quantitative genetics approach, we estimated the proportion of the variance in thermal tolerance traits that has a genetic basis (i.e. heritability) as a proxy for their adaptive potential in the widespread Indo-Pacific reef-building coral Acropora millepora. We chose two physiologically different populations that associate respectively with one thermo-tolerant (Symbiodinium clade D) and one less tolerant symbiont type (Symbiodinium C2). In both symbiont types, pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed significant heritabilities for traits related to both photosynthesis and photoprotective pigment profile. However, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays showed a lack of heritability in both coral host populations for their own expression of fundamental stress genes. Coral colony growth, contributed to by both symbiotic partners, displayed heritability. High heritabilities for functional key traits of algal symbionts, along with their short clonal generation time and high population sizes allow for their rapid thermal adaptation. However, the low overall heritability of coral host traits, along with the corals' long generation time, raise concern about the timely adaptation of the coral-algal symbiosis in the face of continued rapid climate warming.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",English,"CsÃ¡szÃ¡r, NBM (Corresponding Author), Univ Technol Sydney, Dept Environm Sci, Plant Funct Biol \& Climate Change Cluster, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.

These conditions induce the expulsion of zooxanthellae from the coral host in response to photosynthetic damage in the algal symbionts. The mechanism that triggers this release has not been clearly established and to further our knowledge of this process, fluorescence rise kinetics have been studied for the first time. Corals that were exposed to elevated temperature (33 degreesC) and light (280 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1)), showed distinct changes in the fast polyphasic induction of chlorophyll-a fluorescence, indicating biophysical changes in the photochemical processes. The fluorescence rise over the first 2000 ms was monitored in three species of corals for up to 8 h, with a PEA fluorometer and an imaging-PAM. Pocillopora damicornis showed the least impact on photosynthetic apparatus, while Acropora nobilis was the most sensitive, with Cyphastrea serailia intermediate between the other two species. A. nobilis showed a remarkable capacity for recovery from bleaching conditions. For all three species, a steady decline in the slope of the initial rise and the height of the J-transient was observed, indicating the loss of functional Photosystem II ( PS II) centres under elevated-temperature conditions. A significant loss of PS II centres was confirmed by a decline in photochemical quenching when exposed to bleaching stress. Non-photochemical quenching was identified as a significant mechanism for dissipating excess energy as heat under the bleaching conditions. Photophosphorylation could explain this decline in PS II activity. State transitions, a component of non-photochemical quenching, was a probable cause of the high non-photochemical quenching during bleaching and this mechanism is associated with the phosphorylation-induced dissociation of the light harvesting complexes from the PS II reaction centres. This reversible process may account for the coral recovery, particularly in A. nobilis.",SPRINGER,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",English,"Ralph, PJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Water \& Environm Resource Management, Westbourne St Gore Hill, NSW 2065, Australia.

K.",Differential nitric oxide synthesis and host apoptotic events correlate with bleaching susceptibility in reef corals,CORAL REEFS,2014,33,1,141-153,MAR,"Coral bleaching poses a threat to coral reefs worldwide. As a consequence of the temperature-induced breakdown in coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis, bleaching can have extensive effects on reef communities. However, our understanding of bleaching at a cellular level is limited, and this is particularly true regarding differential susceptibility among coral species. Recent work suggests that bleaching may represent a host innate immune-like response to symbiont dysfunction that involves synthesis of the signalling compound nitric oxide (NO) and the induction of host apoptotic-like cell death. In this study, we examined the activity of apoptosis-regulating enzymes alongside oxidised NO accumulation (a proxy for NO synthesis) in the reef corals Acropora millepora, Montipora digitata, and Pocillopora damicornis during experimental thermal stress. P. damicornis was the most sensitive species, suffering mortality (tissue sloughing) after 5 days at 33 A degrees C but non-lethal bleaching after 9 days at 31.5 A degrees C. A. millepora bleached at 33 A degrees C but remained structurally intact, while M. digitata showed little evidence of bleaching. P. damicornis and A. millepora both exhibited evidence of temperature-induced NO synthesis and, after 5 days of heating, levels of oxidised NO in both species were fivefold higher than in controls maintained at 28.5 A degrees C. These responses preceded bleaching by a number of days and may have occurred before symbiont dysfunction (measured as chlorophyll a degradation and oxidised NO accumulation). In A. millepora, apparent NO synthesis correlated with the induction of host apoptotic-like pathways, while in P. damicornis, the upregulation of apoptotic pathways occurred later. No evidence of elevated NO production or apoptosis was observed in M. digitata at 33 A degrees C and baseline activity of apoptosis-regulating enzymes was negligible in this species. These findings provide important physiological data in the context of the responses of corals to global change and suggest that early events in the host may be important in the collapse of the coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis.",SPRINGER,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",English,"Davy, SK (Corresponding Author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.

Although the diversity of Symbiodinium provides a possible axis for niche diversification, increased functional range and resilience to physical stressors such as elevated temperature, how such diversity relates to the physiological balance between autotrophy and heterotrophy of the host animal remains unknown. Here, we experimentally show interspecific and intraspecific variability of photosynthetic carbon fixation and subsequent translocation by Symbiodinium to the model cnidarian host Aiptasia pallida. By using a clonal anemone line harboring different species of Symbiodinium, we determined that symbiont identity influences trophic plasticity through its density, capacity to fix carbon, quantity of translocated carbon and ultimately the host's capacity to ingest and digest prey. Symbiont carbon translocation and host prey ingestion were positively correlated across symbiont combinations that consisted of different isoclonal lines of Symbiodinium minutum, while a combination with type D4-5 Symbiodinium displayed lower carbon translocation, and prey capture and digestion more similar to Aiptasia lacking symbionts. The absence of a shift toward greater heterotrophy when carbon translocation is low suggests that the metabolic demand of feeding and digestion may overwhelm nutritional stores when photosynthesis is reduced, and amends the possible role of animal feeding in resistance to or recovery from the effects of climate change in more obligate symbioses such as reef-building corals.",COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",English,"Leal, MC (Corresponding Author), Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.

During warm episodes in the geological past, these reef-building organisms expanded their geographical ranges as subtropical and tropical belts moved into higher latitudes. During these range-expansion periods, LBF were the most prolific carbonate producers on reefs, dominating shallow carbonate platforms over reef-building corals. Even though the fossil and modern distributions of groups of species that harbour different types of symbionts are known, the nature, mechanisms, and factors that influence their occurrence remain elusive. Furthermore, the presence of a diverse and persistent bacterial community has only recently gained attention. We examined recent advances in molecular identification of prokaryotic (i.e. bacteria) and eukaryotic (i.e. microalgae) associates, and palaeoecology, and place the partnership with bacteria and algae in the context of climate change. In critically reviewing the available fossil and modern data on symbiosis, we reveal a crucial role of microalgae in the response of LBF to ocean warming, and their capacity to colonise a variety of habitats, across both latitudes and broad depth ranges. Symbiont identity is a key factor enabling LBF to expand their geographic ranges when the sea-surface temperature increases. Our analyses showed that over the past 66 million years (My), diatom-bearing species were dominant in reef environments. The modern record shows that these species display a stable, persistent eukaryotic assemblage across their geographic distribution range, and are less dependent on symbiotic photosynthesis for survival. By contrast, dinoflagellate and chlorophytic species, which show a provincial distribution, tend to have a more flexible eukaryotic community throughout their range. This group is more dependent on their symbionts, and flexibility in their symbiosis is likely to be the driving force behind their evolutionary history, as they form a monophyletic group originating from a rhodophyte-bearing ancestor. The study of bacterial assemblages, while still in its infancy, is a promising field of study. Bacterial communities are likely to be shaped by the local environment, although a core bacterial microbiome is found in species with global distributions. Cryptic speciation is also an important factor that must be taken into consideration. As global warming intensifies, genetic divergence in hosts in addition to the range of flexibility/specificity within host-symbiont associations will be important elements in the continued evolutionary success of LBF species in a wide range of environments. Based on fossil and modern data, we conclude that the microbiome, which includes both algal and bacterial partners, is a key factor influencing the evolution of LBF. As a result, the microbiome assists LBF in colonising a wide range of habitats, and allowed them to become the most important calcifiers on shallow platforms worldwide during periods of ocean warming in the geologic past. Since LBF are crucial ecosystem engineers and prolific carbonate producers, the microbiome is a critical component that will play a central role in the responses of LBF to a changing ocean, and ultimately in shaping the future of coral reefs.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Prazeres, M (Corresponding Author), Naturalis Biodivers Ctr, Marine Biodivers Grp, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.

In the last few decades, mass bleaching events have occurred in the coral reefs, causing damage in the ecosystem and the associated species. Global temperature increase is affecting the algae, disturbing the whole symbiosis and leads to coral bleaching. However, the heat tolerance is strongly determined by the species (formerly genetic clades) harbored by the coral host. We assessed three different strains of Symbiodiniaceae family, i.e., Fugacium kawagutii (CS156), Symbiodinium tridacnidorum (2465), and Symbiodinium microadriaticum (2467), which display different heat tolerance under heat stress conditions. Flash-induced chlorophyll fluorescence relaxation is a useful tool to monitor various components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain and the redox reactions of plastoquinone pool. We observed the appearance of a wave phenomenon in the fluorescence relaxation by heating the strains in combination with microaerobic conditions. The characteristics of this fluorescence wave were found to be strain-specific and possibly related to the transient oxidation and re-reduction of the plastoquinone pool. The appearance of the wave phenomenon appears to be related to cyclic electron flow as well because it is accompanied with enhanced post-illumination chlorophyll fluorescence rise. These results will potentially reveal further details of the role of cyclic electron transport in Symbiodiniaceae and its relevance in heat stress tolerance.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",English,"Vass, I; Szabo, M (Corresponding Author), Eotvos Lorand Res Network, Inst Plant Biol, Biol Res Ctr, Szeged, Hungary.

We investigated how C. orientalis responded to past and future ocean conditions in a simulated community setting. The experiment lasted over an Austral summer under four carbon dioxide emission scenarios: a pre-industrial scenario (PI), a present-day scenario (PD; control), and two future scenarios of combined ocean acidification and ocean warming, i.e., B1 (intermediate) and A1FI (extreme). The four scenarios also simulated natural variability of carbon dioxide partial pressure and temperature in seawater. Responses of C. orientalis generally remained similar between the PI and PD treatments. C. orientalis under B1 displayed a dramatic increase in lateral tissue extension, but bleached and displayed reduced rates of respiration and photosynthesis. Some B1 sponge replicates died by the end of the experiment. Under A1FI, strong bleaching and subsequent mortality of all C. orientalis replicates occurred at an early stage of the experiment. Mortality arrested bioerosion by C. orientalis under B1 and A1FI. Overall, the absolute amount of calcium carbonate eroded by C. orientalis under B1 or A1FI was similar to that under PI or PD at the end of the experiment. Although bioerosion rates were raised by short-term experimental acidification in previous studies, our findings from the photosymbiotic C. orientalis imply that the effects of bioerosion on reef carbonate budgets may only be temporary if the bioeroders cannot survive long-term in the future oceans.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"Fang, JKH (Corresponding Author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Coral Reef Ecosyst Lab, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.

Since the algal symbionts provide the energy basis for corals and whole reefs, their loss or impairment of function leads to widespread mortality. This phenomenon has been documented numerous times in recent years, and has extensively damaged coral reefs all over the world. Temperature has been found to be the major cause of bleaching, and rising sea temperatures have increased the frequency of these catastrophic episodes. To characterize the response of zooxanthellae to temperature stress at the molecular level, we used the mRNA differential display technique to monitor changes in the abundance of specific mRNA species in the cell under different temperature conditions. Axenically grown zooxanthellae were exposed to a range of temperatures (21.7, 17, 26 degrees C) before extraction of their mRNA. Of numerous differentially expressed sequences, seven mRNA species were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced. One of those sequences was positively identified as encoding a multifunction cell surface aminopeptidase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV, which is active in cell matrix adhesion.

One such mechanism recently has been suggested by the association between the growth of juvenile corals and seawater temperature in the Caribbean, which suggests that temperature causes a transition between isometric and allometric growth scaling in warmer versus cooler years, respectively (Edmunds in Proc R Soc B 273:2275-2281, 2006). Here, this correlative association is tested experimentally for a cause-and-effect relationship. During April and May 2006, juvenile colonies (8-35 mm diameter) of massive Porites spp. from Moorea, French Polynesia, were incubated at warm (27.8 degrees C) and cool (25.7 degrees C) temperatures for 15 days, and their response assessed through the scaling of growth (change in weight) with colony size. The results reveal that the scaling of colony-specific growth (mg colony(-1) day(-1)) was unaffected by temperature, although growth absolutely was greater at the cool compared to the warm temperature, regardless of colony size. This outcome was caused by contrasting scaling relationships for area-specific growth (mg cm(-2) day(-1)) that were negatively allometric under warm conditions, but independent of size under cool conditions. In April 2007, a 22 days field experiment confirmed that the scaling of area-specific growth in juvenile Porites spp. is negatively allometric at a warm temperature of 29.5 degrees C.

However, this conclusion clearly depends on the ability of the investigated bioeroding organisms to survive and grow in the warmer and more acidic future environments, which remains unexplored. The excavating sponge Cliona orientalis Thiele, is a widely distributed bioeroding organism and symbiotic with dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium. Using C. orientalis, an energy budget model was developed to calculate amounts of carbon directed into metabolic maintenance and growth. This model was tested under a range of CO2 emission scenarios (temperature+pCO(2)) appropriate to an Austral early summer. Under a pre-industrial scenario, present day (control) scenario, or B1 future scenario (associated with reducing the rate of CO2 emissions over the next few decades), C. orientalis maintained a positive energy budget, where metabolic demand was likely satisfied by autotrophic carbon provided by Symbiodinium and heterotrophic carbon via filter-feeding, suggesting sustainability. Under B1, C. orientalis likely benefited by a greater supply of photosynthetic products from its symbionts, which increased by up to 56\% per unit area, and displayed an improved condition with up to 52\% increased surplus carbon available for growth. Under an A1FI future scenario (associated with business-as-usual' CO2 emissions) bleached C. orientalis experienced the highest metabolic demand, but carbon acquired was insufficient to maintain the sponge, as indicated by a negative energy budget. These metabolic considerations suggest that previous observations of increased bioerosion under A1FI by C. orientalis may not last through the height of future A1FI summers, and survival of individual sponges may be dependent on the energy reserves (biomass) they have accumulated through the rest of the year.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Fang, JKH (Corresponding Author), Univ Queensland, Coral Reef Ecosyst Lab, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.

Whilst the genetic diversity of Symbiodinium has attracted particular interest because of its contribution to the sensitivity of corals to environmental changes and bleaching (i.e. disruption of coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis), very little is known about the in hospite metabolic capabilities of different Symbiodinium types. Using a combination of stable isotopic labelling and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS), we investigated the ability of the intact symbiosis between the reef-building coral Isopora palifera, and SymbiodiniumC or D types, to assimilate dissolved inorganic carbon (via photosynthesis) and nitrogen (as ammonium). Our results indicate that Symbiodinium types from two clades naturally associated with I.palifera possess different metabolic capabilities. The SymbiodiniumC type fixed and passed significantly more carbon and nitrogen to its coral host than the D type. This study provides further insights into the metabolic plasticity among different Symbiodinium types in hospite and strengthens the evidence that the more temperature-tolerant SymbiodiniumD type may be less metabolically beneficial for its coral host under non-stressful conditions.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Pernice, M (Corresponding Author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil \& Environm Engn ENAC, Lab Biol Geochem, Lausanne, Switzerland.

However, little is known of the natural environmentally induced fractionations that affect our interpretation of coral delta N-15 values. In symbiotic scleractinians, light affects metabolic fractionation of N during photosynthesis, which may confound the identification of N pollution between sites of varied depth or turbidity. Given the superiority of octocorals for delta N-15 studies, our goal was to quantify the effect of light on gorgonian delta N-15 in the context of monitoring N pollution sources. Using field collections, we show that delta N-15 declined by 1.4aEuro degrees over 20 m depth in two species of gorgonians, the common sea fan, Gorgonia ventalina, and the slimy sea plume, Pseudopterogorgia americana. An 8-week laboratory experiment with P. americana showed that light, not temperature causes this variation, whereby the lowest fractionation of the N source was observed in the highest light treatment. Finally, we used a yearlong reciprocal depth transplant experiment to quantify the time frame over which delta N-15 changes in G. ventalina as a function of light regime. Over the year, delta N-15 was unchanged and increased slightly in the deep control colonies and shallow colonies transplanted to the deep site, respectively. Within 6 months, colonies transplanted from deep to shallow became enriched by 0.8aEuro degrees, mirroring the enrichment observed in the shallow controls, which was likely due to the combined effect of an increase in the source delta N-15 and reduced fractionation. We conclude that light affects gorgonian delta N-15 fractionation and should be considered in sampling designs for N pollution monitoring.

Photosynthetic irradiance is an important secondary factor. Host based pigments (pocilloporins or Green Fluorescent Protein homologues) have been proposed to reduce the impact of elevated temperature by shading the dinoflagellate symbionts of corals, thereby reducing light stress. This study investigates this phenomenon in the reef-building coral Acropora aspera from Heron Island Research Station (Great Barrier Reef, Australia), which occurs as 3 distinct colour morphs. Experimental data showed that the host pigments are photoprotective at normal temperatures or <32degreesC; however, the loss of symbionts and reduction in the quantum yield of photosynthesis (dark adapted F-v/F-m) observed after exposure to elevated temperature was most severe in the heavily pigmented blue morph, eventually resulting in death of most experimental colonies. The results suggest that the protection offered by pocilloporins and other GFP-homologues is reduced by thermal stress, potentially leaving the shade-acclimated symbionts of heavily pigmented corals exposed to high light levels. Mature host pigments are thermally stable, but they are potentially vulnerable to heat during mRNA and protein synthesis and/or maturation, It is clear, however, that the broad assumption that host pigmented corals are less vulnerable to thermal stress is incorrect.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",English,"Dove, S (Corresponding Author), Univ Queensland, Ctr Marine Studies, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.

The changes in maximum quantum yield (F-v/F-m) and maximum electron transport rate (ETRmax) revealed three patterns during the 30 h treatment at 32degreesC under 450 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1). P. ryukyuensis showed small but significant changes in F-v/F-m without changes in ETRmax and S. caliendrum showed a drastic decrease in both parameters, while M. digitata and P. cylindrica showed similar trend in decrease of the F-v/F-m values only. After 30 h exposure to thermal stress, the total chlorophyll content decreased significantly only in S. caliendrum and zooxanthellae density decreased significantly in all tested coral species except of P. ryukyuensis. Mortality data over four months after the thermal stress treatment showed three trends. P. ryukytiensis and S. caliendrum showed no mortality and 100\% mortality, respectively. Mortality in M. digitata was greater than that in P. cylindrica. These results suggest that in P. ryukyuensis (resistant coral) both the algae and the host are strong while in S. caliendrum (susceptible coral) both partners are weak. Although intermediate coral species, M. digitata and P. cylindrica showed the same level of F-v/F-m reductions and percentage loss of zooxanthellae, the host component seemed to be stronger in P. cylindrica than in M. digitata as revealed by their different mortalities.

The different levels of emphasis are the coral animal and the reef community. The main study area is the Red Sea which reaches over 20 degrees latitude up to the northernmost margin of the global coral reef belt. Supplementary results on microborer ecology are provided from the Bahamas. The desert enclosed Red Sea, not influenced by land runoff and only minimally by anthropogenic (urban and touristic) nutrient inputs, is predestined for a study on the principal influence of light on calcification within bathymetrical and latitudinal gradients. Hence, on the level of the zooxanthellate scleractinian animal phototrophic and heterotrophic energy supply and its bearing on calcification are being measured in different coral species - in particular in Porites sp., one of the most important reef builders. The growth of 15 zooxanthellate scleractinians in the Gulf of Aqaba correlates with the annual light cycle. This correlation is observable down to 40 m depth. Other growth promoting factors seem to have less influence on coral extension. The availability of organically enriched sediments in shallow water probably yields nutritional value, in particular for filter feeding species, thus restricting their distribution to those areas. Zooxanthellae, when isolated from Mycedium elephantotus, are different in their dependence on depth in maximum rates of photosynthesis and photosynthetic efficiency ( -slope). Increasing concentrations of pigments as a function of depth could be determined. Maximum rates of photosynthesis of zooxanthellae in vivo, collected at corresponding depth, have been 4 times higher. Structural and physiological adaptations improving heterotrophic and phototrophic energy intake are highlighted. Porites sp. was the subject of annual growth studies at locations extending from Aqaba in the North over the northern and southern Egyptian coast and islands, Sanganeb Atoll and Wingate reef offshore Sudan to the Gulf of Tadjoura in the Gulf of Aden (Djibouti). Mean growth rates in the shallow water zone increase with decreasing latitude and are highest at the southernmost studied reefs in the Gulf of Tadjoura. However, the observed latitudinal growth reduction is restricted to the upper ca. 15 m of the water column. The upper limit of growth potential decreases with depth parallel to the decrease of light availability. Highest growth rates are recorded in shallow depth (10-12.9 mm yr(-1)). This zone reaches at Aqaba (29 degrees 30'N) to a depth of ca. 10 m. At the southern Egyptian reefs (24 degrees 30'N) this zone extends to ca. 15 m water depth. This effect is probably a result of the stronger reduction of winter light levels and water temperature in the northern regions. Compared to other oceans the decrease of growth with increasing latitude of Red Sea Porites corals is far less, and growth rates at Aqaba are the highest observed at these latitudes. On the level of the community of reef inhabitants four principal topics are addressed: The first one is the dynamics of the proportions of hermatypic and ahermatypic organisms and open space. The occurrence of stony and soft corals and the sharing of empty space in different reef sections at Aqaba and on Sanganeb Atoll were quantified. Soft corals, mainly Sinularia- and xeniid species, occupy decreasing shares with depth. Among the Xenia species a bathymetrical zonation pattern was detected. The next issue is the growth impeding role of soft corals and gastropod parasites and predators on scleractinians. Experimental and field observations showed xeniid soft corals to be opportunistic i.e. occupying rapidly open space rather than to attacking and outcompeting stony corals. An increasingly specialized behaviour was detected among corallivorous gastropods of the family Corallophilidae to exploit their coral hosts. Whereas these snails are more or less sessile and depend for a long time on the surrounding host polyps the mobile Drupella cornus (Thaididae) forms feeding aggregations which denude mainly branching corals on shallow reef parts. Furthermore, the role counteracting reef growth of macro- and microbioeroders is investigated. Diadema setosum is a major destructive agent on reefs at Aqaba (not in the central Red Sea). The grazing sea urchins do not only keep potential colonization area free but also erode carbonate material (e. g. 1468 g/m(2)/year, 10 m depth). Demographic and bathymetric patterns in the sea urchin population are analyzed including their bearing on bioerosion of the reef. Investigations on microboring organisms in carbonate material have started in the Red Sea; initial results, however, are only available from similar studies near Lee Stocking island, Bahamas. Three major environments have been identified based on the distribution of the different microborers. These are 1) the intertidal environment dominated by boring cyanobacteria, 2) reef sites from 2 to 30 m water depth dominated by a diverse assemblage of boring cyanobacteria and chlorophytes, and 3) the deep reef slope from 100 to 300 m dominated by boring green algae and heterotrophs. The boring chlorophyte genus Phaeophila appears rapidly and dominates at sites from 2 to 30 m, but it leaves vacated borings and is replaced by Ostreobium quekettii after 1 year. Different substrate types show very different rates of colonization by microborers. The greatest excavation rates (100 g /m(2)/3 months) occur in fine-grained limestone, while the slowest rates (0.5 g/m(2)/3 months) occur in calcite crystals. Molluscan shell material shows intermediate rates of excavation.

They are crucial to the survival of plants and most of the animals that harbour them. An example of a non-photosynthesizing plastid in animals is the apicoplast in the malaria-causing Plasmodium species, which is required for survival of the parasite. Many animals (such as sea slugs, sponges, reef corals, and clams) consume prey containing chloroplasts, or feed on algae. Some of these incorporate the chloroplasts from their food, or whole algal cells, into their own cells. Other species from these groups place algal cells between their own cells. Reef-building corals often lose their intracellular algae as a result of environmental changes, resulting in coral bleaching and death. The sensitivity of the chloroplast internal membranes to temperature stress is one of the reasons for coral death. Chloroplasts can also be a causal factor in the processes leading to whole-plant death, as the knockout of a gene encoding a chloroplast protein delayed the yellowing that proceeds death in tobacco plants. It is concluded that chloroplasts and other plastids are essential to individual survival in many species, including animals, and that they also play a role in triggering death in some plant and animal species.

Both acclimatization and selection likely affect the response of corals to future climate change. The local environment is therefore an important factor to consider for restoration ecology. In this study, we exposed Orbicella faveolata from two different locations in Florida (Emerald Reef, near Key Biscayne in the upper Florida Keys, and Truman Harbor near Key West in the lower Florida Keys) that were common-gardened for one month prior to experimentation to four temperature, CO2, and food availability treatments (26 degrees C/390 ppm, 26 degrees C/1000 ppm, 31 degrees C/390 ppm, and 31 degrees C/1000 ppm where each of these treatments had fed and unfed components). The goal was to determine how the same species of coral from different locations would respond to projected climate change scenarios. Wefound that growth (measured as changes in buoyant weight) was highly correlated to source location (i.e., whether the corals came from Emerald Reef or Truman Harbor) and not to parent colony, and growth, symbiont density, chlorophyll a content, and lipid content were highly correlated to feeding regime. These findings show that within a single reef tract, (i.e. the Florida Reef Tract), source location and food availability matter for the physiological outcome of a coral's stress response, and suggest that an explicit consideration of these effects may be important for management activities such as coral restoration, transplantation, and MPA placement.

One colony (HL) was naturally exposed to a high light environment and another nearby colony (LL) was exposed to 5.9 times lower light levels due to shadowing by a pier. For 10 days in August 1997, seawater temperatures in the surrounding reef lagoon rose up to 1.5degreesC above the 6-year August average. The HL colony bleached to white during this period, whereas, the LL colony remained dark-brown colored. The HL colony recovered its normal dark-brown coloration (reversible bleaching) within several weeks, during which time the seawater temperatures returned to average. The following year, for 10 days, seawater temperatures rose up to 3degreesC above the 7-year August average and both colonies bleached to white and neither colony recovered (irreversible bleaching). Both colonies were rapidly overgrown by algae and hydroids and, as of June 2003, no recovery has taken place. Prior to the 1997 bleaching, experiments using solar radiation showed that the quantum yield of photosystem II charge separation of branches from HL and LL colonies were affected for several hours by exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 280 to 400 nm), but recovered by the same evening, suggesting that UVR does not have long-term effects on photochemistry in M. alcicornis. In situ effective quantum yield of photosystem II charge separation (DeltaF/Fm') measurements before the 1998 bleaching event indicate that both colonies were healthy in terms of the physiological status of their endosymbionts. During and after the 1998 bleaching event, both colonies showed a reduction in DeltaF/Fm' and consequently an increase in excitation pressure on photosystem II. The data suggest that temperature is not the only factor that causes bleaching and that solar radiation may play an important role in coral bleaching.",REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL,"UNIVERSIDAD DE COSTA RICA CIUDAD UNIVERSITARIA, SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA",English,"Banaszak, AT (Corresponding Author), Unidad Acad Puerto Morelos, Apartado Postal 1152, Cancun 77500, Mexico.

Stress may damage photochemistry in the endosymbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium spp., leaving photosystems I and II relatively reduced and increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS). Alternatively, ROS may emanate from mitochondria of either the host or the symbiont, or both. These sources of ROS can be distinguished by using microscopy to examine the effects of light on stressed cnidarians incubated in the dark with a fluorescent, ROS-detecting probe. Experiments were carried out with three species of alcyonacean octocoral, Phenganax parrini, Sarcothelia sp., and Sympodium sp. After incubation of colonies for 1h at elevated temperature, imaging and illumination (excitation 450-490nm, emission 515-565nm) were begun simultaneously. Formation of ROS largely corresponded to the onset of illumination. On the other hand, chlorophyll fluorescence (excitation 530-580nm, emission 620-690nm) did not conform to this pattern. This difference is consistent with the expected rates of reaction. Remarkably, treatment with the inhibitor 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) resulted in dramatically higher levels of light-induced ROS. Chlorophyll fluorescence was higher in the DCMU treatment but not significantly so. By controlling for variation between individual symbionts, however, DCMU produced significantly greater levels of chlorophyll fluorescence, indicating the expected greater reduction of photosystem II. A brief exposure to light and thermal stress produced a similar effect in all three species. In addition to ROS being initiated by light, these results indicate that: (1) a brief period of stress shifts photosystem redox state toward reduction, (2) photosystem II can donate electrons to oxygen when blocked with DCMU, and (3) chlorophyll fluorescence is highly variable among individuals of Symbiodinium. Imaging of individual symbionts in hospite thus provides a powerful method for understanding the initial steps of the cnidarian stress response.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Blackstone, NW (Corresponding Author), Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Biol Sci, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA.

Nowadays, many studies have focused on the influence of diving activities on coral communities, while the knowledge of physiological changes under corresponding environmental stresses remains largely undetermined. In the study, we aimed to investigate the physiological effects of touching, ammonia nitrogen enrichment (5 mu mol.L-1), and sediment cover (particle size of less than 0.3 mm), which simulated improper self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) diving behaviors, on Acropora hyacinthus and Porites cylindrica in Wuzhizhou Island, the South China Sea. For A. hyacinthus, continuous touching caused the tentacles to shrink and secrete mucus, which consumed energy and dissolved oxygen. The skeletal growth rate was decreased by 72\% compared with the control group. There was a rapid decline of Fv/Fm and alpha under the dual impacts of high ammonia nitrogen and touching, while the Chl a concentration and tissue biomass were decreased by 36 and 28\% compared with touching alone, respectively. High ammonia nitrogen and touching increased the concentrations of lipid and protein. Nevertheless, zooxanthellae density was increased by 23\% to relieve the effects of a lower concentration of Chl a in a high nutrient environment. Constant touching and sediment cover in diving areas with elevated ammonia content affected the photosynthesis and respiration of corals, and a significant decrease was observed for lipid, zooxanthellae density, and Chl a concentration. Coral bleaching occurred on day 7. For P. cylindrica, the decreasing magnitude of Fv/Fm and alpha under different stresses in the subsequent phase was less compared with A. hyacinthus. The contents of carbohydrate and protein under continuous touching were decreased by 7 and 15\% compared with the control group, respectively, causing negative growth. Under the dual influences of high ammonia nitrogen and continuous touching, all energy reserves were significantly lower. Repeated touching and sediment cover in diving areas containing high ammonia content increased the concentrations of lipid and protein compared with the touching and high nutrient treatment group likely because that Porites associated with C15 zooxanthella increased heterotrophic feeding to compensate for restricted symbiodiniaceae photosynthesis. Additionally, P. cylindrica produced mucus to aid the removal of sediment, so that corals didn't obviously bleach during the experiment. Collectively, P. cylindrica was more resistant to diving activities than A. hyacinthus which only relies on photoautotrophy. To ensure the sustainable development of coral reef dive tourism, it is necessary to strengthen the supervision of diving behaviors, rotate the diving areas, and conduct regular assessments on the coral status.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",English,"Li, XB (Corresponding Author), Hainan Univ, Coll Marine Sci, Haikou, Hainan, Peoples R China.

The F-v/F-m was markedly reduced following exposure of corals to 28 degrees C for 48 h. When corals were returned to ambient (24 degrees C) conditions, F-v/F-m increased in an initial rapid and then secondary slower phase. Tissue discolouration (coral bleaching), caused by a significant decrease in the density of algae, was observed during the first 2-3 days of the recovery period. After 14 days, F-v/F-m was still significantly lower than in control corals. The recovery of F-v/F-m is discussed in terms of repair processes within the symbiotic algae, division of healthy algae and also the selective removal of photo-damaged dinoflagellates. Under field conditions, bleached corals sampled at Heron Island Reef during a bleaching event had significantly lower F-v/F-m than non-bleached colonies; four months after the bleaching event, there were no differences in F-v/F-m or algal density in corals marked as having bleached or having shown no signs of colour loss.

In this study, we explored the implications for juvenile scleractinians (<40-mm diameter) of growing on igneous versus carbonate rock on the shallow reefs (5-m depth) of St. John, US Virgin Islands. Surveys revealed that juvenile corals occurred at densities of 16 colonies m(-2) and were distributed on igneous and carbonate rocks in proportion to the abundance of these surfaces, suggesting that larvae do not discriminate between rock types at settlement. Repeated surveys demonstrated that all juvenile corals (i.e., pooled among taxa) grew 41\% slower on igneous versus carbonate rock between January and August, but not between August and January when the growth was statistically indistinguishable between rock types. Although the growth of the most common juvenile coral, Porites astreoides, was similar on both substrata, the photophysiology of this species was affected by the type of rock. The maximum relative electron transfer rate (rETR, a proxy for photosynthesis) of P. astreoides was down-regulated 30\% on igneous compared to carbonate rock. Phylogenetic analyses of the Symbiodinium community sequence profiles within P. astreoides revealed significant differences between substrata, with a greater diversity of co-occurring ITS-2 sequences in corals growing on carbonate compared to igneous rock. While substratum-dependent patterns in the characteristics of juvenile corals suggested there is selective value to the settlement choices made by larvae, these trends did not translate into differences in survival, at least over the time scale investigated. It remains uncertain what features of the rocks affected coral performance, but differences in the temperature of the rock may be an important feature during the warmest period of the year.

They experience large variability across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales, with complex external and internal drivers. Organisms influence pH at a patch scale, where community metabolic effects and hydrodynamic processes interact to produce broad ranges in pH, (similar to 0.3-0.5 pH units) over daily cycles and spatial scales (mm to m) particularly in shallow vegetated habitats and coral reefs where both respiration and photosynthetic activity are intense. Biological interactions at the ecosystem scale, linked to patchiness in habitat landscapes and seasonal changes in metabolic processes and temperature lead to changes of about 0.3-0.5 pH units throughout a year. Furthermore, on the scale of individual organisms, small-scale processes including changes at the Diffusive Boundary Layer (DBL), interactions with symbionts, and changes to the specific calcification environment, induce additional changes in excess of 0.5 pH units. In these highly variable pH environments calcifying organisms have developed the capacity to alter the pH of their calcifying environment, or specifically within critical tissues where calcification occurs, thus achieving a homeostasis. This capacity to control the conditions for calcification at the organism scale may therefore buffer the full impacts of ocean acidification on an organism scale, although this might be at a cost to the individual. Furthermore, in some areas, calcifiers may potentially benefit from changes to ambient seawater pH, where photosynthetic organisms drawdown CO2. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In symbiotic corals, calcification is a daily process and depends on the ability of the coral colony to produce energy, through the photosynthesis of symbiotic algae or heterotrophy, while sexual reproduction in several broadcast spawning species is carried out once a year and depends on the amount of energy stored as lipids within the coral tissue. Calcification and reproduction are influenced by environmental parameters, such as light irradiance and sea surface temperature (SST). Reproduction may be inhibited by thermal stress and coral calcification rate decreases as SST increases above a certain threshold. However, it is unknown if there is a sex-related response of calcification rate to thermal history. Here, we test the differential sensitivities of calcification rates to thermal history by examining its recent historical variation in females and males of two common Caribbean gonochoric reef-building coral species,Dichocoenia stokesiandDendrogyra cylindrus. Colony sex was determined by histological techniques, and sclerochronology was measured using densitometry from digitized X-ray images. Calcification rates were higher in male colonies than in females of both species, as previously reported in other gonochoric corals, and can be explained in terms of disparity in energy availability for calcification among sexes due to the differential energetic costs of eggs and sperm. Calcification rates of both species were negatively related to SST when data of both sexes were pooled together. When data were analyzed separately by sex, only female colonies, of both species, showed a significant dependence of calcification rate to SST. The fact that SST differentially affects coral calcification in female and male colonies, will have repercussions on population dynamics of the studied coral species in a global warming scenario.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",English,"Carricart-Ganivet, JP (Corresponding Author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar \& Limnol, Unidad Acad Sistemas Arrecifales, Prol Av Ninos Heroes S-N, Puerto Morelos 77580, Q Roo, Mexico.

To improve predictions of the ecological effects of ocean acidification, the net gains and losses between the processes of photosynthesis and calcification need to be studied jointly on physiological and population levels. We studied productivity, respiration, and abundances of the symbiont-bearing foraminifer species Marginopora vertebralis on natural CO2 seeps in Papua New Guinea and conducted additional studies on production and calcification on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) using artificially enhanced pCO2. Net oxygen production increased up to 90\% with increasing pCO2; temperature, light, and pH together explaining 61\% of the variance in production. Production increased with increasing light and increasing pCO2 and declined at higher temperatures. Respiration was also significantly elevated (similar to 25\%), whereas calcification was reduced (1639\%) at low pH/high pCO2 compared to present-day conditions. In the field, M. vertebralis was absent at three CO2 seep sites at pHTotal levels below similar to 7.9 (pCO2 similar to 700 similar to mu atm), but it was found in densities of over 1000 similar to m-2 at all three control sites. The study showed that endosymbiotic algae in foraminifera benefit from increased DIC availability and may be naturally carbon limited. The observed reduction in calcification may have been caused either by increased energy demands for proton pumping (measured as elevated rates of respiration) or by stronger competition for DIC from the more productive symbionts. The net outcome of these two competing processes is that M. vertebralis cannot maintain populations under pCO2 exceeding 700 similar to mu atm, thus are likely to be extinct in the next century.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Uthicke, S (Corresponding Author), Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia.

To fulfil their growth requirements, corals rely on a combination of photosynthetic products translocated from symbiotic zooxanthellae, and particulate heterotrophic sources. In aquaculture, the latter is provided by Artemia sp. nauplii as they provide adequate nutrition and promote optimal growth and survival. In this study, we evaluated feeding rates and estimated growth rates of cultured scleractinian corals. Polyp and colonial nubbins of the coral Galaxea fascicularis were randomly assigned to each of three tanks within three naturally lit systems under standard conditions. Corals were subjected to three feeding treatments: i) fed once or ii) three times weekly, or iii) unfed until the end of the trial (two months). The survival rates were 98.7\% and 100\% for the colonial and polyp forms, respectively. Ingestion rates of Anemia salina nauplii between the three feeding treatments were significantly higher for specimens fed 3-times a week compared to those two treatments involving a lower feeding frequency (individual prey items polyp(-1) 20 min(-1): vs. <= 4, respectively), but growth rates of colonial and polyp forms were not significantly different with respect to feeding frequency. Mean rate of new polyp growth was ca. 4 polyps nubbin(-1) week(-1) for colonial form and ca. 1 polyp polyp(-1) week(-1) for the polyp form. The high survival and growth rates of G. fascicularis, coupled with an apparent low heterotrophic prey requirement, make this species an ideal candidate for commercial propagation in aquaculture.

The thick-tissued massive coral, Cyphastrea serailia, was shown to be more prone to reduction of the PQ pool, with significant reductions in F-v/F-m occurring after 10 min of DA, and elevated J steps occurring within 200 s following a far-red flash.

Experiments were conducted to evaluate the combined effects of elevated temperature and the photosystem II (PSII) inhibiting herbicide diuron on several types of symbiotic algae (diatom, dinoflagellate or rhodophyte) of benthic foraminifera in hospite. Diuron was shown to evoke a direct effect on photosynthetic efficiency (reduced effective PSII quantum yield Delta F/F-m'), while elevated temperatures (>30 degrees C, only 2 degrees C above current average summer temperatures) were observed to impact photosynthesis more indirectly by causing reductions in maximum PSII quantum yield (F-v/F-m), interpreted as photodamage. Additionally, elevated temperatures were shown to cause bleaching through loss of chlorophyll a in foraminifera hosting either diatoms or dinoflagellates. A significant linear correlation was found between reduced F-v/F-m and loss of chlorophyll a. In most cases, symbionts within foraminifera proved more sensitive to thermal stress in the presence of diuron (>= 1 mu g L-1). The mixture toxicity model of Independent Action (IA) described the combined effects of temperature and diuron on the photosystem of species hosting diatoms or dinoflagellates convincingly and in agreement with probabilistic statistics, so a response additive joint action can be assumed. We thus demonstrate that improving water quality can improve resilience of symbiotic phototrophs to projected increases in ocean temperatures. As IA described the observed combined effects from elevated temperature and diuron stress it may therefore be employed for prediction of untested mixtures and for assessing the efficacy of management measures.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",English,"van Dam, JW (Corresponding Author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia. van Dam, Joost W., Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia. van Dam, Joost W.; Negri, Andrew P.; Uthicke, Sven, Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia. van Dam, Joost W.; Mueller, Jochen F., Univ Queensland, Natl Res Ctr Environm Toxicol, Coopers Plains, Australia.

The oxygen isotopic ratios in P. compressa record the seasonal drop in sea surface temperature (SST) during the monsoon season. An earlier calibration of the coralline delta(18)O with observed changes in SST is used to estimate past SST changes and to evaluate the relationship with upwelling and rainfall. The seasonal variations in carbon isotope ratios seem to be controlled by photosynthesis of the algal symbiont, which in turn is modulated by monsoon activities; sedimentation, sediment suspension, water current and turbidity.

However, different corals exhibit differential bleaching susceptibilities, perhaps resulting from dissimilar abilities to deal with oxidative stress. We therefore tested whether thermal sensitivity in Symbiodinium is correlated with the capacity to deal with oxidative stress, by comparing the effects of increased temperature and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration on the photosynthetic performance of four cultured Symbiodinium ITS2 types (A1, B2, E, and F1) and two freshly isolated Symbiodinium ITS2 types (a temperate A-type and B1). Generally, the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (F (v)/F (m)) declined in Symbiodinium with both increasing thermal and oxidative stress. However, not all types followed this pattern. Cultured Symbiodinium A1 showed a strong negative response to elevated temperature but little response to the addition of H2O2, while cultured F1 showed an increase in F (v)/F (m) at elevated temperature but a decline in this parameter to almost zero at high H2O2 concentrations. Furthermore, both freshly isolated Symbiodinium types appeared to be relatively stress tolerant, with the temperate A-type showing an especially high resistance to both stressors. In conclusion, a range of Symbiodinium types were shown to differ in their susceptibilities to both thermal and oxidative stress, though in contrast to our original hypothesis, sensitivity to oxidative stress did not necessarily predict thermal sensitivity (or vice versa).",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",English,"Davy, SK (Corresponding Author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.

The expulsion of the symbiotic dinoflagellate algae is believed to occur as a result of damage to the photosynthetic apparatus of these symbionts, although the specific site of initial impact is yet to be conclusively resolved. Here, the sensitivity of the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) to bleaching stress was studied as well as its natural variation between seasons. The artificial electron donor, diphenyl carbazide (DPC), was added to cultured, freshly isolated and expelled (bleaching treatments only) zooxanthellae suspensions. Chl a fluorescence and oxygen production measurements showed that upon addition of DPC, no restoration of diminished photochemical efficiency occurred under control or bleaching conditions. This result was consistent between 12 h and 5 d bleaching treatments on Pocilloporadamicornis, indicating that the OEC is not the primary site of damage, and that zooxanthellae expulsion from the host is a nonselective process with respect to the functioning of the OEC. Further experiments measuring fast induction curves (FICs) revealed that in both summer and winter, the temperature when OEC function was lost occurred between 7 degrees C and 14 degrees C above the sea surface temperature. FIC and oxygen production measurements of P. damicornis during exposure to bleaching stress demonstrated that the thermotolerance of the OEC increased above the temperature of the bleaching treatment over a 4 h period. This finding indicates that the OEC has the capacity to acclimate between seasons and remains functional at temperatures well above bleaching thresholds.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Hill, R (Corresponding Author), Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Water \& Environm Resource Management, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia.

Until now, the method has only been applied in homogeneous phytoplankton cultures and field samples. Corals are among the world's most productive ecosystems because they host symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae) that provide them with a large amount of photosynthates for their energy requirements. Coral reefs face unprecedented pressures on local, regional, and global scales due to climate change and anthropogenic disturbances. Responses to such stress are often a decrease in the photosynthetic efficiency of the symbiotic dinoflagellates, as well as bleaching, which involves the mass expulsion of these symbionts or loss of their pigments. Photosynthesis is a sensitive indicator of stress in plants and plays a central role in the nutrition of symbiotic invertebrates. Our aim was to examine the applicability of photoacoustics, developed by us for ecological work with phytoplankton, to the study of symbiotic dinoflagellates in situ. We have determined areal chlorophyll content and light energy storage efficiency with three zooxanthellate coelenterates, two corals and one hydrozoan, hosting symbiotic algae. We also present the effect of temperature elevation on the decrease in photosynthetic efficiency of the symbiotic coral Stylophora pistillata determined by photoacoustics. Our results demonstrate the potential, power, and convenience of photoacoustics in following bleaching-related changes in coral pigmentation, in the photosynthetic energy storage efficiency of corals, and in its usefulness in diagnosing its health in relation to environmental factors, in the example presented here, seawater warming.",AMER SOC LIMNOLOGY OCEANOGRAPHY,"5400 BOSQUE BLVD, STE 680, WACO, TX 76710-4446 USA",English,"Pinchasov-Grinblat, Y (Corresponding Author), Bar Ilan Univ, Mina \& Everard Goodman Fac Life Sci, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel.

Although bleaching events reveal fine-scale patterns of resilience, traits enabling persistence under global change remain elusive. We conducted a 95-d controlled-laboratory experiment investigating how duration of exposure to warming (similar to 28, 31 degrees C), acidification (pCO(2) similar to 343 {[}present day], similar to 663 {[}end of century], similar to 3109 {[}extreme] mu atm), and their combination influences physiology of reef-building corals (Siderastrea siderea, Pseudodiploria strigosa) from two reef zones on the Belize Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. Every 30 d, net calcification rate, host protein and carbohydrate, chlorophyll a, and symbiont density were quantified for the same coral individual to characterize acclimation potential under global change. Coral physiologies of the two species were differentially affected by stressors and exposure duration was found to modulate these responses. Siderastrea siderea exhibited resistance to end of century pCO(2) and temperature stress, but calcification was negatively affected by extreme pCO(2). However, S. siderea calcification rates remained positive after 95 d of extreme pCO(2) conditions, suggesting acclimation. In contrast, P. strigosa was more negatively influenced by elevated temperatures, which reduced most physiological parameters. An exception was nearshore P. strigosa, which maintained calcification rates under elevated temperature, suggesting local adaptation to the warmer environment of their natal reef zone. This work highlights how tracking coral physiology across various exposure durations can capture acclimatory responses to global change stressors.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Aichelman, HE; Davies, SW (Corresponding Author), Boston Univ, Dept Biol, 5 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA.

The primary drivers of this phenomenon are the inherent genetic variability in the Family Symbiodiniaceae, and the variability in the abiotic environment for variables such as irradiance and temperature. Recent experiments have either disregarded the important interactive role of irradiance or have suggested that photooxidative stress is not a prerequisite for coral bleaching because certain reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be produced in the dark. Here, fluorescent probes are used as proxies for the relative concentration of ROS in different genera of cultured Symbiodiniaceae under varying thermal and light conditions. The results show that taxon-specific patterns of the concentration of ROS are observed but that all genera tested produced significantly greater amounts of superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide, compared to singlet oxygen, when exposed to high light and thermal stress. These results are contextualized in relation to the primary drivers of ROS production and the photo-physiological basis for differences in ROS production that may then be correlated with symbiont driven coral bleaching.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Lesser, MP (Corresponding Author), Univ New Hampshire, Dept Mol Cellular \& Biomed Sci, Durham, NH 03824 USA.

Previous studies have laid this groundwork using a limited number of Symbiodinium phylotypes, and so this study aims to expand this understanding by exploring the effects of sub-lethal elevated temperatures on the physiological response of seven genetically distinct types of Symbiodinium, including A1, B1, B2, C1, D, E1, and F2. The production of ROS (at 26 A degrees C, 29 A degrees C, 30 A degrees C, and 31 A degrees C) and activity of the antioxidants catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (at 26 A degrees C and 31 A degrees C) were measured as indicators of sensitivity or tolerance to heat stress. Symbiodinium types B1 and C1 were the most thermally sensitive, with C1 producing the highest amount of ROS at elevated temperatures. Types A1 and F2 were tolerant, having no increase in ROS production, and were the only types to increase both CAT and SOD activity with temperature stress. Type B2 had decreased ROS production and elevation of CAT activity, while type E1 had decreased levels of ROS production at elevated temperatures. Type D was the only Symbiodinium type to remain unaffected by elevated temperatures. These results are consistent with previous findings of relative sensitivity or tolerance to elevated temperatures, specifically with regards to types A1, B1, and F2. The inclusion of types B2, C1, D, and E1 provides further new evidence of how types differ in their thermal responses, suggesting differing mechanisms exist in the Symbiodnium response to higher temperature and highlighting the importance of establishing symbiont identity when exploring the response of intact associations to this type of stress.",SPRINGER,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",English,"Mydlarz, LD (Corresponding Author), Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Biol, 501 S Nedderman Dr, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.

Recent studies have proposed that microorganisms may be involved in onset and progression of polyp bail-out. However, changes in the coral microbiome during polyp bail-out have not been investigated. In this study, we induced polyp bail-out in Pocillopora corals using hypersaline and hyperthermal methods. Bacterial community dynamics during bail-out induction were examined using the V5-V6 region of the 16S-rRNA gene. From 70 16S-rRNA gene libraries constructed from coral tissues, 1,980 OTUs were identified. Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria consistently constituted the dominant bacterial taxa in all coral tissue samples. Onset of polyp bail-out was characterized by increased relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria and decreased abundance of Gammaproteobacteria in both induction experiments, with the shift being more prominent in response to elevated temperature than to elevated salinity. Four OTUs, affiliated with Thalassospira, Marisediminitalea, Rhodobacteraceae, and Myxococcales, showed concurrent abundance increases at the onset of polyp bail-out in both experiments, suggesting potential microbial causes of this coral stress response.IMPORTANCE Polyp bail-out represents both a stress response and an asexual reproductive strategy with significant implications for reshaping tropical coral reefs in response to global climate change. Although earlier studies have suggested that coral-associated microbiomes likely contribute to initiation of polyp bail-out in scleractinian corals, there have been no studies of coral microbiome shifts during polyp bail-out. In this study, we present the first investigation of changes in bacterial symbionts during two experiments in which polyp bail-out was induced by different environmental stressors. These results provide a background of coral microbiome dynamics during polyp bail-out development. Increases in abundance of Thalassospira, Marisediminitalea, Rhodobacteraceae, and Myxococcales that occurred in both experiments suggest that these bacteria are potential microbial causes of polyp bail-out, shedding light on the proximal triggering mechanism of this coral stress response. Polyp bail-out represents both a stress response and an asexual reproductive strategy with significant implications for reshaping tropical coral reefs in response to global climate change.

Coral bleaching has often been attributed to periods of above normal seawater temperatures and/or calm conditions with high levels of ultraviolet radiation. Unusually high shallow-water temperature (>29degreesC) in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, USA, in late summer (20 August-9 September) and fall (1-7 October) of 1996 produced visible bleaching of two dominant corals, Porites compressa Dana, 1864 and Montipora verrucosa Dana, 1864. The present study examined chlorophyll a (chl a), total lipid concentrations, and lipid class composition in corals of both species in which the entire colony was non-bleached, moderately bleached, or bleached. Skeletal, host tissue, and algal symbiont delta(13)C values were also measured in non-bleached and bleached colonies. In additional unevenly bleached colonies, paired samples were collected from bleached upper surfaces and non-bleached sides. Samples were collected on 20 November 1996 during the coral recovery phase, a time when seawater temperatures had been back to normal for over a month. Chl a levels were significantly lower in bleached colonies of both species compared with non-bleached specimens, and in bleached areas of unevenly bleached single colonies. Total lipid concentrations were significantly lower in bleached P. compressa compared with non-bleached colonies, whereas total lipid concentrations were the same in bleached and non-bleached M. verrucosa colonies. The proportion of triacylglycerols and wax esters was lower in bleached colonies of both species. Both bleached and non-bleached M. verrucosa had from similar to17\% to 35\% of their lipids in the form of diacylglycerol, while this class was absent in P. compressa. delta(13)C was not significantly different in the host tissue and algal symbiont fractions in non-bleached and bleached samples of either species. This suggests that the ratio of carbon acquired heterotrophically versus photosynthetically was the same regardless of condition. Skeletal delta(13)C was significantly lower in bleached than in non-bleached corals. This is consistent with previous findings that lower rates of photosynthesis during bleaching results in lower skeletal delta(13)C values. The two species in this study displayed different lipid class compositions and total lipid depletions following bleaching, suggesting that there is a difference in their metabolism of lipid reserves and/or in their temporal responses to bleaching and recovery.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",English,"Grottoli, AG (Corresponding Author), Univ Penn, Dept Earth \& Environm Sci, 240 S 33rd St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.

Scleractinian corals cannot survive for long periods without their symbionts. These algae, also known as zooxanthellae, on the other hand, thrives outside the coral cells. The free-living populations of zooxanthellae are essential for the resilience of the coral to environmental stressors such as temperature anomalies and ocean acidification. Yet, little is known about how ocean acidification may affect the free-living zooxanthellae. In this study we aimed to test morphological, physiological and biochemical responses of zooxanthellae from the Symbiodinium genus isolated from the coral Mussismilia braziliensis, endemic to the Brazilian coast, to acidification led by increased atmospheric CO2. We tested whether photosynthetic yield, cell ultrastructure, cell density and lipid profile would change after up to 16 days of exposure to pH 7.5 in an atmospheric pCO(2) of 1633 mu atm. Photosynthetic yield and cell density were negatively affected and chloroplasts showed vesiculated thylakoids, indicating morphological damage. Moreover, Symbiodinium fatty acid profile drastically changed in acidified condition, showing lower polyunsaturated fatty acids and higher saturated fatty acids contents, when compared to the control, non-acidified condition. These results show that seawater acidification as an only stressor causes significant changes in the physiology, biochemistry and ultrastructure of free-living Symbiodinium.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",English,"Salgado, LT (Corresponding Author), Inst Pesquisas Jardim Bot Rio de Janeiro, Diretoria Pesquisas, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.

Characterizing these attributes has been approached by 1) building reference models for specific Phanerozoic intervals, 2) recognizing the climatic impact in modulating carbonate production, and 3) analyzing the influence of changing bio-geochemical conditions. The reference-model approach is mostly based on biological evolution, the climatic-impact approach emphasizes temperature, and the bio-geochemical approach considers the changes in Mg/Ca ratios and Ca++ concentrations in the oceans. To date, however, an analysis integrating all of these factors is still missing. The analysis presented here includes all these factors but also CO2, which is fundamental for both photosynthesis and CaCO3 precipitation. Here we analyze the waxing and waning of Cenozoic reef limestones from the central Tethys region through several steps: 1) on the basis of rock volume, rock textures, associated sediments and light dependent skeletal components, as records of light penetration and wave energy (depth); 2) on global environmental conditions (delta C-13, delta O-18, pCO(2), temperature); and 3) on the basis of functionality, nutritional requirements and available resources. Through the Cenozoic, water motion, whether induced by surface or internal waves or by currents, increased as the thermal gradients strengthened, both with depth and with latitude. Active water motion is essential for plankton catchers such as corals, but less so for many larger benthic foraminifers (LBF). Pycnoclines in the meso-oligophotic zone would then favor the benthic plankton catchers such as corals, but would be detrimental for many LBF. Warm temperatures favored LBF. The Eocene LBF families predominated during lowering of atmospheric pCO(2) by using respiratory CO2 to enhance the symbiont production of photosynthates under oligotrophic conditions and limited turbulence, whereas the Miocene families had to adapt to a progressive increase in turbulence. The eurythermal coralline red algae, however, became preponderant producers in the mesophotic zone during times when the delta C-13 was relatively high. This explains two apparent paradoxes: 1) corals thrive best when the Earth's high latitudes cool, and 2) the dominance of corals and LBF is inversely correlated, despite they both require tropical conditions and have similar trophic strategies (mixotrophy).

The scallop Argopecten purpuratus is an important economic resource that is cultivated in areas where coastal upwelling is intensifying by climate change, potentially affecting host-microbiota interactions. Thus, we first characterized the bacterial community present in gills from cultivated scallops (by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) and assessed their stability and functional potential in animals under farm and laboratory conditions. Results showed that under both conditions the gill bacterial community is dominated by the phylum Campylobacterota (57\%), which displays a chemoautotrophic potential that could contribute to scallop nutrition. Within this phylum, two phylotypes, namely symbionts A and B, were the most abundant; being, respectively, taxonomically affiliated to symbionts with nutritional functions in mussel gills, and to uncultured bacteria present in coral mucus. Additionally, in situ hybridization and scanning electron microscopy analyses allowed us to detect these symbionts in the gills of A. purpuratus. Given that shifts in upwelling phenology can cause disturbances to ecosystems, affecting bacteria that provide beneficial functions to the host, we further assessed the changes in the abundance of the two symbionts (via qPCR) in response to a simulated upwelling intensification. The exposure to combined decreasing values in the temperature, pH, and oxygen levels (upwelling conditions) favored the dominance of symbiont B over symbiont A; suggesting that symbiont abundances are modulated by these environmental changes. Overall, results showed that changes in the main Campylobacterota phylotypes in response to upwelling intensification could affect its symbiotic function in A. purpuratus under future climate change scenarios. These results provide the first insight into understanding how scallop gill-microbial systems adapt and respond to climate change stressors, which could be critical for managing health, nutrition, and scallop aquaculture productivity.",MDPI,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",English,"Brokordt, K (Corresponding Author), Univ Catolica Norte, Fac Ciencias Mar, Dept Acuicultura, Lab Fisiol \& Genet Marina FIGEMA, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo 1781421, Chile.

Stony corals are severely threatened by anthropogenic warming, which has resulted in repeated mass bleaching and mortality events. Since corals are sessile as adults and with a relatively old age of sexual maturity, they are slow to latitudinally migrate, but corals may also migrate vertically to deeper, cooler reefs. Herein we describe vertical migration of the Mediterranean coral Oculina patagonica from less than 10 m depth to > 30 m. We suggest that this range shift is a response to rapidly warming sea surface temperatures on the Israeli Mediterranean coastline. In contrast to the vast latitudinal distance required to track temperature change, this species has migrated deeper where summer water temperatures are up to 2 degrees C cooler. Comparisons of physiology, morphology, trophic position, symbiont type, and photochemistry between deep and shallow conspecifics revealed only a few depth-specific differences. At this study site, shallow colonies typically inhabit low light environments (caves, crevices) and have a facultative relationship with photosymbionts. We suggest that this existing phenotype aided colonization of the mesophotic zone.

Although the degree of photoinhibition in Symbiodinium under heat stress differs among strains, the differences in their responses to increased temperatures, including cyclic electron flow (CEF), which sustains photoprotective thermal energy dissipation, have not been investigated. Here, we examined CEF in cultured Symbiodinium cells or those in an endosymbiotic relationship within a cnidarian host. The light-dependent reduction of the primary electron donor photosystem I, i.e. P700(+), was enhanced in any Symbiodinium cell by increasing temperatures, indicating CEF was induced by heat, which was accompanied by thermal energy dissipation activation. The critical temperatures for inducing CEF were different among Symbiodinium strains. The clade A strains with greater susceptibility to photoinhibition, OTcH-1 and Y106, exhibited higher CEF activities under moderate heat stress than a more phototolerant clade B strain Mf1.05b, suggesting that the observed CEF induction was not a preventive measure but a stress response in Symbiodinium.",AMER SOC PLANT BIOLOGISTS,"15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA",English,"Minagawa, J (Corresponding Author), Natl Inst Basic Biol, Div Environm Photobiol, Nishigonaka 38, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan.

For many coral-algal symbioses, prolonged episodes of thermal stress damage the symbiont's photosynthetic capability, resulting in its expulsion from the host. Despite the link between photosynthetic competency and symbiont expulsion, little is known about the effect of thermal stress on the expression of photosystem genes in Symbiodinium. This study used real-time PCR to monitor the transcript abundance of two important photosynthetic reaction center genes, psbA (encoding the D1 protein of photosystem II) and psaA (encoding the P-700 protein of photosystem I), in four cultured isolates (representing ITS2-types A13, A20, B1, and F2) and two in hospite Symbiodinium spp. within the coral Pocillopora spp. (ITS2-types C1b-c and D1). Both cultured and in hospite Symbiodinium samples were exposed to elevated temperatures (32 degrees C) over a 7-day period and examined for changes in photochemistry and transcript abundance. Symbiodinium A13 and C1b-c (both thermally sensitive) demonstrated significant declines in both psbA and psaA during the thermal stress treatment, whereas the transcript levels of the other Symbiodinium types remained stable. The downregulation of both core photosystem genes could be the result of several different physiological mechanisms, but may ultimately limit repair rates of photosynthetic proteins, rendering some Symbiodinium spp. especially susceptible to thermal stress.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",English,"Warner, ME (Corresponding Author), Univ Delaware, Coll Earth Ocean \& Environm, Lewes, DE 19958 USA.

Cultures were incubated undisturbed to eliminate potential adverse effects of mixing or agitation. Specific growth rates were determined from daily cell counts obtained using an inverted microscope. Sufficient data for the calculation of specific growth rates were collected in 7-10 d. Specific growth rates approached the theoretical maximum of one division per day for dinoflagellates. Similar growth rates also were observed with undisturbed 30 ml cultures prepared in sealed polyethylene sample bags. However, bag cultures that were mixed daily exhibited no growth; when daily mixing was stopped, cultures grew at rates similar to undisturbed bag cultures indicating that undisturbed cultures were optimal for Symbiodinium growth. The micro-culturing technique was used to examine the effects of temperature and salinity on the growth of six Symbiodinium spp. Growth was differentially affected by incubation temperatures of 27, 29, 31, 33, and 35 degrees C as well as by culture medium having salinities of 10, 15, 20, 25, 35, 40, and 45.

The 2 species had different responses to seasonal changes in light and seawater temperature. P. decussata was associated only with clade C zooxanthellae (at all sampling times) while genotypic clade composition fluctuated in P. divaricata. Three colonies of P. divaricata harbored clade D throughout the year and the other 7 colonies changed clade type from C to D or vice versa, or contained a mixture of both clades on some sampling occasions. Though neither coral species suffered bleaching during the experimental period, there were Fv/Fm decreases in P. decussata and P. divaricata harboring clade C during cold and warm seasons; F-v/F-m,, of P. divaricata harboring clade D was stable. When exposed to low or high temperature under normal or high light, P. divaricata harboring clade D was less damaged and Photosystem II recovery was faster than in P. decussata harboring clade C. These results suggest that the sympatric congeneric corals have different symbiont switching flexibilities and this difference might account for the observed difference in stress susceptibility between the two species.

Studies which examine the host physiology and microbial communities have shown a variety of responses to the ocean acidification process. Recently, several studies were conducted based on field experiments, which take place in natural CO2 vents, exposing the host to natural environmental conditions of varying pH. This study examines the sea anemone Anemonia viridis which is found naturally along the pH gradient in Ischia, Italy, with an aim to characterize whether exposure to pH impacts the holobiont. The physiological parameters of A. viridis (Symbiodinium density, protein, and chlorophyll a+c concentration) and its microbial community were monitored. Although reduction in pH was seen to have had an impact on composition and diversity of associated microbial communities, no significant changes were observed in A. viridis physiology, and no microbial stress indicators (i.e., pathogens, antibacterial activity, etc.) were detected. In light of these results, it appears that elevated CO2 does not have a negative influence on A. viridis that live naturally in the site. This suggests that natural long-term exposure and dynamic diverse microbial communities may contribute to the acclimation process of the host in a changing pH environment.",SPRINGER,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",English,"Banin, E (Corresponding Author), Bar Ilan Univ, Inst Nanotechnol \& Adv Mat, Ramat Gan, Israel.

Although impacts of combined ocean acidification (OA) and temperature stress (T) on reef-building scleractinian corals have been studied at the genus, species and population levels, there are little data available on how individual corals respond to combined OA and anomalous temperatures. In this study, we exposed individual colonies of Acropora digitifera, Montipora digitata and Porites cylindrica to four pCO(2)-temperature treatments including 400 mu atm-28 degrees C, 400 mu atm-31 degrees C, 1000 mu atm-28 degrees C and 1000 mu atm-31 degrees C for 26 days. Physiological parameters including calcification, protein content, maximum photosynthetic efficiency, Symbiodinium density, and chlorophyll content along with Symbiodinium type of each colony were examined. Along with intercolonial responses, responses of individual colonies versus pooled data to the treatments were investigated. The main results were: 1) responses to either OA or T or their combination were different between individual colonies when considering physiological functions; 2) tolerance to either OA or T was not synonymous with tolerance to the other parameter; 3) tolerance to both OA and T did not necessarily lead to tolerance of OA and T combined (OAT) at the same time; 4) OAT had negative, positive or no impacts on physiological functions of coral colonies; and 5) pooled data were not representative of responses of all individual colonies. Indeed, the pooled data obscured actual responses of individual colonies or presented a response that was not observed in any individual. From the results of this study we recommend improving experimental designs of studies investigating physiological responses of corals to climate change by complementing them with colony-specific examinations.

Determining species elemental quotas (their elementome) is a key indicator for their success across environments with different resource availabilities. Elementomes remain undescribed for functionally diverse dinoflagellates within the family Symbiodiniaceae that includes coral endosymbionts. We used dry combustion and ICP-MS to assess whether Symbiodiniaceae (ten isolates spanning five genera Breviolum, Cladocopium, Durusdinium, Effrenium, Symbiodinium) maintained under long-term nutrient replete conditions have unique elementomes (six key macronutrients and nine micronutrients) that would reflect evolutionarily conserved preferential elemental acquisition. For three isolates we assessed how elevated temperature impacted their elementomes. Further, we tested whether Symbiodiniaceae conform to common stoichiometric hypotheses (e.g., the growth rate hypothesis) documented in other marine algae. This study considers whether Symbiodiniaceae isolates possess unique elementomes reflective of their natural ecologies, evolutionary histories, and resistance to environmental change. Results Symbiodiniaceae isolates maintained under long-term luxury uptake conditions, all exhibited highly divergent elementomes from one another, driven primarily by differential content of micronutrients. All N:P and C:P ratios were below the Redfield ratio values, whereas C:N was close to the Redfield value. Elevated temperature resulted in a more homogenised elementome across isolates. The Family-level elementome was (C19.8N2.6 P1.0S18.8K0.7Ca0.1) center dot 1000 (Fe55.7Mn5.6Sr2.3Zn0.8Ni0.5Se0.3Cu0.2Mo0.1V0.04) mmol Phosphorous(-1) versus (C25.4N3.1P1.0S23.1K0.9Ca0.4) center dot 1000 (Fe66.7Mn6.3Sr7.2Zn0.8Ni0.4Se0.2Cu0.2Mo0.2V0.05) mmol Phosphorous (-1) at 27.4 +/- 0.4 degrees C and 30.7 +/- 0.01 degrees C, respectively. Symbiodiniaceae isolates tested here conformed to some, but not all, stoichiometric principles. Conclusions Elementomes for Symbiodiniaceae diverge from those reported for other marine algae, primarily via lower C:N:P and different micronutrient expressions. Long-term maintenance of Symbiodiniaceae isolates in culture under common nutrient replete conditions suggests isolates have evolutionary conserved preferential uptake for certain elements that allows these unique elementomes to be identified. Micronutrient content (normalised to phosphorous) commonly increased in the Symbiodiniaceae isolates in response to elevated temperature, potentially indicating a common elemental signature to warming.",BMC,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",English,"Camp, EF (Corresponding Author), Univ Technol Sydney, Climate Change Cluster C3, POB 123, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.

From September until December 1999, the study investigated the effects of high light intensities and increased temperature accompanied by a nutrient limitation on the metabolism of Tridacna gigas, to test, if these environmental changes can induce bleaching. In a 50-day trial similar conditions of the mass bleaching event were imitated stressing clams, collected from Orpheus Island and Nelly Bay, by a two- to threefold light intensity and an increased temperature of 4-6 degreesC. The objectives of the experiments were to determine whether high light intensities can induce changes in chlorophyll content or alter zooxanthella cell sizes and populations in the tissue. After 50 days of exposure to high light intensity the mantle tissue of stressed clams exhibited a decreased number of zooxanthellae per unit area from 19.8 +/- 0.8 (x 10(7).cm(-2)) to 0.2 +/- 0.2 (x 10(7.)cm(-2)) (Mean +/- CL). Additionally, the average cell size of zooxanthellae were downsized from 7.4 +/- 0.1 mum to 5.3 +/- 0.1 mum (mean CL). Subsequently, the chlorophyll content of both, chl a and chl c, declined as well, chl a from 192 +/- 4 to 0.1 +/- 0.1 mug.ml(-1) and chl c(1) from 145 +/- 6 to 0 mug.ml(-1) (mean CL). This study shows that increased light intensity and temperature are the main causes for bleaching in giant clams. Thus, the study confirmed the four major aspects involved in bleaching: (1) loss of symbiotic algae, (2) decrease of chl a/c(1) in the remaining symbiotic algae, (3) retention of small zooxanthellae in the tissue and (4) release of ammonium (NH4+) into the water column while nutrient uptake of ammonium was largely blocked.

In situations of stress, access to energy reserves can minimize physiological damage. Because of its widespread requirements in biochemical processes, iron is an important trace metal, especially for photosynthetic organisms. Lowered iron availability in oceans experiencing rising temperatures may contribute to the thermal sensitivity of reef-building corals, which rely on mutualisms with dinoflagellates to survive. To test the influence of iron concentration on thermal sensitivity, the physiological responses of cultured symbiotic dinoflagellates (genus Breviolum; family Symbiodiniaceae) were evaluated when exposed to increasing temperatures (26 to 30 degrees C) and iron concentrations ranging from replete (500 pM Fe') to limiting (50 pM Fe') under a diurnal light cycle with saturating radiance. Declines in photosynthetic efficiency at elevated temperatures indicated sensitivity to heat stress. Furthermore, five times the amount of iron was needed to reach exponential growth during heat stress (50 pM Fe ` at 26-28 degrees C vs. 250 pM Fe ` at 30 degrees C). In treatments where exponential growth was reached, Breviolum psygmophilum grew faster than B.minutum, possibly due to greater cellular contents of iron and other trace metals. The metal composition of B.psygmophilum shifted only at the highest temperature (30 degrees C), whereas changes in B.minutum were observed at lower temperatures (28 degrees C). The influence of iron availability in modulating each alga's response to thermal stress suggests the importance of trace metals to the health of coral-algal mutualisms. Ultimately, a greater ability to acquire scarce metals may improve the tolerance of corals to physiological stressors and contribute to the differences in performance associated with hosting one symbiont species over another.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Reich, HG (Corresponding Author), Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.

Recent studies have shown that elevated seawater temperatures can cause the collapse of their endosymbiosis, known as `bleaching', and result in mass mortality. However, the molecular interplay between temperature responses and symbiotic states still remains unclear. To identify candidate genes relevant to the symbiotic stability, we performed transcriptomic analyses under multiple conditions using the symbiotic and apo-symbiotic (symbiont free) Exaiptasia diaphana, an emerging model sea anemone. Gene expression patterns showed that large parts of differentially expressed genes in response to heat stress were specific to the symbiotic state, suggesting that the host sea anemone could react to environmental changes in a symbiotic state-dependent manner. Comparative analysis of expression profiles under multiple conditions highlighted candidate genes potentially important in the symbiotic state transition under heat-induced bleaching. Many of these genes were functionally associated with carbohydrate and protein metabolisms in lysosomes. Symbiont algal genes differentially expressed in hospite encode proteins related to heat shock response, calcium signaling, organellar protein transport, and sugar metabolism. Our data suggest that heat stress alters gene expression in both the hosts and symbionts. In particular, heat stress may affect the lysosome-mediated degradation and transportation of substrates such as carbohydrates through the symbiosome (phagosome-derived organelle harboring symbiont) membrane, which potentially might attenuate the stability of symbiosis and lead to bleaching-associated symbiotic state transition.",OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",English,"Maruyama, S; Kawata, M (Corresponding Author), Tohoku Univ, Aoba Ku, Biol Bldg,6-3 Aramaki Aza Aoba, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan.

Comparative studies between symbiotic (Anemonia viridis) and non-symbiotic (Actinia schmidti) sea anemones show striking dffferences in their response to oxidative stress. First, the basal expression of SOD is very different. Symbiotic animal cells have a higher isoform diversity (number and classes) and a higher activity than the non-symbiotic cells. Second, the symbiotic animal cells of A. viridis also maintain unaltered basal values for cellular damage when exposed to experimental hyperoxia (100\% O-2) or to experimental thermal stress (elevated temperature +7degreesC above ambient). Under such conditions, A. schmidti modifies its SOD activity significantly. Electrophoretic patterns diversify, global activities diminish and cell damage biomarkers increase. These data suggest symbiotic cells adapt to stress while non-symbiotic cells remain acutely sensitive. In addition to being toxic, high O-2 partial pressure P-O2) may also constitute a preconditioning step for symbiotic animal cells, leading to an adaptation to the hyperoxic condition and, thus, to oxidative stress. Furthermore, in aposymbiotic animal cells of A. viridis, repression of some animal SOD isoforms is observed. Meanwhile, in cultured symbionts, new activity bands are induced, suggesting that the host might protect its zooxanthellae in hospite. Similar results have been observed in other symbiotic organisms, such as the sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella and the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata. Molecular or physical interactions between the two symbiotic partners may explain such variations in SOD activity and might confer oxidative stress tolerance to the animal host.",COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",English,"Allemand, D (Corresponding Author), Univ Nice, F-06108 Nice 02, France.

With the pronounced diel light changes, distinct temporal variations in MAA concentrations might also be expected. We examined the changes in the abundance of MAA in three shallow-water scleractinian corals, Pavona divaricata, Galaxea fascicularis and Montipora digitata from Okinawa, Japan, in relation to daily cycles in solar radiation and tested whether the species have different capabilities for protection against UVR depending on their MAA composition. The results show that symbiotic algae freshly isolated from the investigated coral species do not contain MAAs and that distribution of these compounds resided only within the animal tissue. Total MAA content in the tissue of P. divaricata, G. fascicularis and M. digitata rose rapidly at midday and significantly dropped at night. The observed variations were by a factor of two and, thus, very dramatic. For all the investigated coral species, total MAA concentrations were significantly correlated with the diurnal cycle in solar radiation, during both winter and summer seasons. Seawater temperature was significantly correlated with MAA levels only in the June experiment, but represented no more than 20\% of the MAA variation in all three coral species, whereas solar radiation explained 60-70\% of the MAA fluctuations. This suggests that MAAs are an integral component of the hard coral's biochemical defense system against high solar irradiance stress. The diurnal increase in total MAA concentrations was due to an increase in the concentration of imino-MAA species of up to 2-2.5-fold of their pre-dawn values. In contrast, the oxocarbonyl-MAA mycosporine-glycine (Myc-Gly) showed the lowest (Tukey-Kramer HSD test: P<0.05) values at midday, compared to afternoon and night hours. Analysis of diel changes in chlorophyll fluorescence and chlorophyll content of the investigated species revealed that P. divaricata and G. fascicularis were less sensitive to the high levels of ambient irradiance compared to M. digitata. In P. divaricata and G. fascicularis, Myc-Gly, an MAA with an antioxidant function, is the most abundant MAA, contributing about 70\% to the total MAA pool, whereas the major MAA factions in M. digitata were represented by oxidatively robust imino-MAAs. We speculate that MAAs furnish scleractinian corals with protection from biologically damaging ultraviolet radiation through both the direct sunscreening activity of imino-MAAs and the antioxidant properties of oxocarbonyl-MAAs and suggest that the predominance, in the host tissue, of MAA species with an antioxidant ability may render corals more tolerant to high photosynthetically active and ultraviolet radiation.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",English,"Yakovleva, I (Corresponding Author), Russian Acad Sci, Inst Marine Biol, Far Eastern Branch, Vladivostok 690041, Russia.

However, recent studies of sponges, jellyfish, and anemones have revealed the potential for this mutualistic relationship to shift to parasitism under stressful conditions. Over a period of eight weeks, we compared the physiological conditions of both inoculated and aposymbiotic anemones (Exaiptasia pallida) that were either fed or starved.

Moreover, inoculated and starved anemones tended to disintegrate into ``tissue balls{''} within eight weeks, and 25\% of the samples died; in contrast, starved aposymbiotic anemones required six months to form tissue balls, and no anemones from this group died. Our results show that the dinoflagellates within inoculated anemones may have posed a fatal metabolic burden on their hosts during starvation; this may be because of the need to prioritize their own metabolism and nourishment at the expense of their hosts.

While their thermal tolerance is well described, little is known about their resistance to ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB). Here, we performed a short-term (2 days) UVB-removal incubation with Stylophora pistillata, and in situ measurements with Pocillopora verrucosa complemented by a long-term (46 days) transplantation and UVB-removal experiment. Using a suite of physiological parameters (effective quantum yield (F-v'/F-m'), oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation, LPO), and primary production), we assessed the impacts of UVB on the physiology and acclimation capacity of Red Sea corals. Shielding S. pistillata from UVB did not change the gross primary production or F-v'/F-m', and respiration and LPO in the host remained unaffected. In situ, P. verrucosa exhibited less varying and significantly higher F-v'/F-m' in 8 m depth (0.61 +/- 0.04) than in 4 m (0.52 +/- 0.06), 2 m (0.51 +/- 0.09), and 0.5 m (0.50 +/- 0.11), where water temperatures ranged from 30.5-33.4, 30.6-34.0, 30.8-34.5, 30.6-37.3 degrees C and daily UVB exposures averaged 0.9, 2.9, 11.8 and 21.4 kJ m(-2), respectively. F-v'/F-m' correlated the strongest with UVB (-0.57), followed by PAR (-0.54) and temperature (-0.40), suggesting that UVB is a key determinant of photosynthetic efficiency. F-v'/F-m' of upward transplanted specimens (T 1m) was initially decreased but gradually increased and reached the same values as shallow corals (1 m) after 44 days. UVB removal significantly increased the F-v'/F-m' of transplanted corals in the first 20 days. Oxidative stress was initially highest in T 1m samples under full sunlight but equalized with 1 m specimens by day 46, whereas oxidative stress was significantly reduced by day 4 in T 1m corals sheltered from UVB. Overall, UVB-removal generally had little impact on the physiology of shallow-water S. pistillata and P. verrucosa but considerably accelerated the acclimation of upward transplanted corals. Our study highlights that UVB is a crucial stressor governing the photoacclimation capacity of these Red Sea coral species.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",English,"Overmans, S (Corresponding Author), King Abdullah Univ Sci \& Technol KAUST, Red Sea Res Ctr RSRC, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.

Using P. damicornis and S. caliendrum as a model system, we describe within-brood variation in larval phenotypes and test for release-day effects that influence larval performance in the pelagic phase. Research was conducted in 2010 using larvae from corals collected in June and July from Nanwan Bay (21A degrees 56.179'N, 120A degrees 44.85'E). In June, larval phenotypes of both species were characterized immediately following release, and their competency to settle assessed. In July, larvae of P. damicornis were collected on 3 days over the peak release period and incubated for 7-11 days at 28.0 A degrees C and 320 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1); their phenotypes and settlement competency were measured every 2 days. P. damicornis larvae released close to peak release were 1.6 times larger in size, contained twice the number of Symbiodinium larva(-1), and were 44 \% more likely to settle in the first 24 h than larvae released early in the brood. In addition, peak-release larvae respired at a lower rate than larvae released late in the brood. Similarly, S. caliendrum larvae released close to peak release were 1.4 times larger in size and were 33 \% more likely to settle in the first 5 h than larvae released early in the brood. In July, P. damicornis larvae differed between early (2 days prior to peak), peak, and late (2 days after peak) release. Protein content of early-release larvae was lower than peak- and late-release larvae, and this difference persisted throughout the development. Further, release day affected the way larval respiration varied throughout development. By showing that brooded coral larvae differ between release days and display maternal effects influencing performance in the swimming phase, our results suggest that pocilloporid corals utilize bet-hedging to increase reproductive success.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",English,"Cumbo, VR (Corresponding Author), Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, 18111 Nordhoff St, Northridge, CA 91330 USA.

Symbiodiniaceae density (SD) can effectively reflect the thermal tolerance and health of hard corals. Here, the SDs of 238 samples from the Huangyan Atoll (HA) were analyzed. The results revealed significantly intergeneric and geomorphological differences in SD. Intergeneric variation may reflect that corals with high SD have stronger thermal tolerance. Geomorphic analysis showed that the SDs at the outer reef slope were higher than in the lagoon. Hydrodynamics and sea surface temperature were likely the main influencing factors. Most notably, corals in SCS HA had higher SDs than those at neighboring reefs, indicating that their thermal tolerance were strong, which may be related to HA' s local upwelling. These results suggest that the HA has the potential to serve as a refuge for corals, but increasing human disturbance limit its function.",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",English,"Yu, KF (Corresponding Author), Guangxi Univ, Coral Reef Res Ctr China, Nanning 530004, Peoples R China.

The effect of elevated temperatures on the photosynthetic efficiency of zooxanthellae in symbiosis with temperate corals has not been well investigated. In this study, the corals, Cladocora caespitosa and Oculina patagonica were collected in the Ligurian Sea (44 degrees N, 9 degrees E), maintained during 2 weeks at the mean summer temperature of 24 degrees C and then exposed during 48 h to temperatures of 24 (control), 27, 29 and 32 degrees C. Chlorophyll (chl) fluorescence parameters {[}F-v/F-m, electron transport rate (ETR), non-photochemical quenching (NPQ)] were measured using pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorimetry before, during the thermal increase, and after 1 and 7 days of recovery (corals maintained at 24 degrees C). Zooxanthellae showed a broad tolerance to temperature increase, since their density remained unchanged and there was no significant reduction in their maximum quantum yield (F-v/F-m) or ETR up to 29 degrees C. This temperature corresponded to a 5 degrees C increase compared to the mean summer temperature (24 degrees C) in the Ligurian Sea. At 32 degrees C, there was a significant decrease in chl contents for both corals. This decrease was due to a reduction in the chl/zooxanthellae content. For C. caespitosa, there was also a decrease in ETRmax, not associated with a change in F-v/F-m or in the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ); for O. patagonica, both ETRmax and F-v/F-m significantly decreased, and NPQ(max) showed a significant increase. Damages to the photosystem II appeared to be reversible in both corals, since F-v/F-m values returned to normal after 1 day at 24 degrees C. Zooxanthellae in symbiosis with the Mediterranean corals investigated can therefore be considered as resistant to short-term increases in temperature, even well above the maximum temperatures experienced by these corals in summer.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",English,"Rodolfo-Metalpa, R (Corresponding Author), Ctr Sci Monaco, Av St Martin, MC-98000 Monaco, Monaco.

Its developmental history goes back to the 1970s. Here, I tell the story of how I got involved in its applications to geochemistry in 1974 at the Institut de Physique du Globe in Paris (IPGP) with the Cameca IMS 300 instrument and my ensuing struggles with theories of secondary ion formation processes and the eventual development of the energy filtering approach as an effective method for suppressing molecular ion interferences in silicate minerals and glasses. The geochemical applications of the techniques that I developed with my colleagues at IPGP, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) are summarised in four different categories: (1) trace element zoning of phenocrysts and the kinetics of magmatic crystallisation processes, (2) trace element abundance patterns and geochemical processes in the mantle, (3) use of trace element abundances in magmatic processes in the mid-ocean ridge system, and (4) use of Sr/Ca ratios in biogenic carbonates in palaeoceanographic studies. Trace element zoning patterns observed in phenocrysts reveal that crystal growth in magmas can occur with non-equilibrium partitioning of trace elements at the crystal-melt interface. Trace element zoning patterns in augite phenocrysts from Gough Island also indicate repeated drastic changes in magma composition, suggesting a turbulent dynamic state of magma bodies beneath eruptive centres. Chondrite normalised rare earth element (REE) patterns measured in clinopyroxenes from mantle rocks (peridotites from the Horoman massif and xenoliths in basalts from both oceanic and continental localities) show strong evidence for melt-rock reactions, indicating that lithospheric peridotites depleted in incompatible elements by melt extraction often show evidence of having been subsequently enriched in these elements through melt-rock reaction. The distribution of Sr in garnet inclusions in peridotitic diamonds from South Africa and Siberia is highly heterogeneous over wide concentration ranges, suggesting growth of inclusion garnets as well as formation of these diamonds, occurred shortly before the diamonds were carried to the surface by kimberlite eruptions. Rare earth element and other trace element abundance patterns measured in clinopyroxenes in abyssal peridotites clearly indicate that melting and melt extraction processes beneath mid-ocean ridges is akin to fractional melting by which small degree melt fractions are progressively extracted from residues as the mantle decompresses and only later mixed, sometimes incompletely, to form mid-ocean ridge basalt lavas erupted on the ocean floor. However, meltrock reactions between residual peridotites and upwelling melt fractions could significantly alter trace element abundance patterns of originally residual clinopyroxenes. In situ analyses reveal very large trace element variations occurring on intra-mineral scales, suggesting that precipitation of clinopyroxene also occurred during melt-rock reactions. It is evident that abyssal peridotites contain complex geochemical histories beyond melt extraction via fractional melting. Sr/Ca variations in coral skeletons (aragonite) reveal strong effects of photosynthesis of symbiont algae in day time growth zones, while those in night time growth zones near centres of calcification record variations of sea surface temperatures (SST) in Porites lutea. In Astrangia poculata, which experience a large temperature range (-2 -23 degrees C), non-symbiotic skeletons faithfully record temperature variations, while symbiotic skeletons display ontogenic effects of algal symbionts. Sr/Ca variations in coccolithophores across the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) display different responses of individual species to the sudden greenhouse environment, and the severity of the response also is dependent on the oceanographic conditions of their habitats.",EUROPEAN ASSOC GEOCHEMISTRY,"IPGP-GOPEL-BUREAU 566, 1 RUE JUSSIEU, PARIS CEDEX 05, 75238, FRANCE",English,"Shimizu, N (Corresponding Author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, 266 Woods Hole Rd MS 23, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.

Evaluating stress responses of these organisms is important to predict their fate under future climate projections. Physiological approaches are limited in their ability to resolve the involved molecular mechanisms and attribute stress effects to the host or symbiont, while probing and partitioning of proteins cannot be applied in organisms where the host and symbiont are small and cannot be physically separated. Here we apply a label-free quantitative proteomics approach to detect changes of proteome composition in the diatom-bearing benthic foraminifera Amphistegina gibbosa experimentally exposed to three thermal-stress scenarios. We developed a workflow for protein extraction from less than ten specimens and simultaneously analysed host and symbiont proteomes. Despite little genomic data for the host, 1,618 proteins could be partially assembled and assigned. The proteomes revealed identical pattern of stress response among stress scenarios as that indicated by physiological measurements, but allowed identification of compartment-specific stress reactions. In the symbiont, stress-response and proteolysis-related proteins were up regulated while photosynthesis-related proteins declined. In contrast, host homeostasis was maintained through chaperone up-regulation associated with elevated proteosynthesis and proteolysis, and the host metabolism shifted to heterotrophy.",NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",English,"Stuhr, M (Corresponding Author), Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res ZMT, Biogeochem \& Geol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.

Spatial variation in symbiont distributions in the field is a strong indicator of such potential. We show that, in an association between an abundant temperate sea anemone and its two endosymbionts, the dinophyte Symbiodinium muscatinei (zooxanthellae) and an unidentified green alga (zoochlorellae), densities and ratios of anemones' symbionts change along a light gradient generated by intertidal caves in Washington state. In the laboratory, the photosynthetic performance of zooxanthellate anemones exceeded that of zoochlorellate anemones under high irradiance levels (>100 tmol quanta m(-2) s(-1)). Further, field sampling revealed that caves are divided into three distinct regions based on anemones' algal complements: a brown region of zooxanthellate anemones near the mouth of the cave, a green region of zoochlorellate anemones in the middle of the cave, and a white region of algae-free anemones near the back of the cave. These data, together with field reciprocal transplant experiments showing algae-free anemones' ability to regrow algae consistent with local physical conditions, suggest that algal performance (vs. host selection) determines observed variation in these symbioses. Our results support the idea that temperate, as well as tropical, host-symbiont associations can respond plastically to environmental change. Our data also suggest that intact symbioses in adult hosts are surprisingly stable; bleaching may be required in rearranging host-symbiont associations.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Secord, D (Corresponding Author), Univ Washington, IAS, Environm Sci Program, 1900 Commerce St,Mailstop 358436, Tacoma, WA 98402 USA.

After a bleaching disturbance, population recovery is heavily dependent on reproduction and recruitment success. However, how bleaching directly affects the reproductive performance of giant clams is, to date, unknown. Here, we examined the direct impacts of bleaching on the reproduction of the giant clam Tridacna gigas between 2020 and 2021 in the Philippines. A continuous 6 mo monitoring of egg concentration, egg stage, egg size, recovery, and survival in prolonged bleached (moderate or severe) and non-bleached hatchery-bred T. gigas maintained in the wild was conducted. The probability of producing eggs and the proportion of intact eggs (developing and mature) were highest in healthy giant clams, followed by moderately bleached giant clams, and lowest in severely bleached giant clams in which >50\% individuals had empty gonads. The oocyte mean diameter was similar among giant clams, regardless of degree of bleaching. Only 5 severely bleached giant clams showed partial color recovery, whereas 2 healthy and 12 severely bleached giant clams died. This study shows that apart from the lethal effects of severe bleaching, the reproductive processes of surviving bleached T. gigas such as gametogenesis and egg production can be also negatively affected. Results suggest that the increasing frequency and intensity of bleaching due to thermal stress can lower the reproductive potential of giant clams and likely other zooxanthellate organisms, resulting in reduced recruitment and population decline.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",English,"Sayco, SLG (Corresponding Author), Univ Ryukyus, Grad Sch Engn \& Sci, 1 Senbaru, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030213, Japan.

This triggers a breakdown of the nutritional symbiosis between cnidarian hosts and their Symbiodiniaceae symbionts, resulting in the loss of the algal partner. In the Symbiodiniaceae exists a high genetic diversity with broad physiological plasticity within and between species, resulting in large thermal tolerance. While these variations have been studied in individual taxa, comprehensive comparative experimental data on numerous species are still rare. In the present study, the photosynthetic performance and tolerance as function of light and temperature of nine Symbiodiniaceae genetic types of four different clades were determined. The data indicate significant differences in the response patterns. Almost all algal isolates exhibited low to moderate light requirements for photosynthesis without photoinhibition, and a photosynthetic efficiency between 20 and 80\% in the temperature range 20-34 degrees C, indicating a broad thermal tolerance to temperature fluctuations in tropical regions. The presented data clearly point to a broad photophysiological tolerance and thermal plasticity of genetically different Symbiodiniaceae, which contributes as an important finding to a better understanding of host-symbiont response to an increasing sea surface temperature.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",English,"Karsten, U (Corresponding Author), Univ Rostock, Inst Biol Sci Appl Ecol \& Phycol, Rostock, Germany.

These so-called bleaching events are most often related to an increase in water temperature, which is thought to limit certain Symbiodinium phylotypes from effectively dissipating absorbed excitation energy that is otherwise used for photochemistry. Here, we examined photosynthetic characteristics and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, a possible signal involved in bleaching, from two Symbiodinium types (a thermally ``tolerant{''} A1 and ``sensitive{''} B1) representative of cnidaria-Symbiodinium symbioses of reef-building Caribbean corals. Under steady-state growth at 26 degrees C, a higher efficiency of PSII photochemistry, rate of electron turnover, and rate of O-2 production were observed for type A1 than for B1. The two types responded very differently to a period of elevated temperature (32 degrees C): type A1 increased light-driven O-2 consumption but not the amount of H2O2 produced; in contrast, type B1 increased the amount of H2O2 produced without an increase in light-driven O-2 consumption. Therefore, our results are consistent with previous suggestions that the thermal tolerance of Symbiodinium is related to adaptive constraints associated with photosynthesis and that sensitive phylotypes are more prone to H2O2 production. Understanding these adaptive differences in the genus Symbiodinium will be crucial if we are to interpret the response of symbiotic associations, including reef-building corals, to environmental change.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Suggett, DJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Essex, Coral Reef Res Unit, Dept Biol Sci, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.

Excess inorganic nitrogen relative to phosphate has been proposed to sensitize corals to thermal bleaching. We assessed the physiological and proteomic responses of cultures of the dinoflagellate coral symbiont Symbiodinium microadriaticum to elevated temperature under low-nutrient, high-nutrient and phosphate-limited conditions. Elevated temperature induced reductions of many chloroplast proteins, particularly the light-harvesting complexes, and simultaneously increased the abundance of many chaperone proteins. Proteomes were similar when the N:P ratio was near the Redfield ratio, regardless of absolute N and P concentrations, but were strongly affected by phosphate limitation. Very high N:P inhibited Symbiodinium cell division while increasing the abundance of chloroplast proteins. The proteome response to phosphate limitation was greater than that to elevated temperature, as measured by the number of differentially abundant proteins. Increased physiological sensitivity to high temperatures under high nutrients or imbalanced N:P ratios was not apparent; however, oxidative stress response proteins were enriched among proteins responding to thermal stress under imbalanced N:P ratios.

In this respect, an impairment of photosynthesis would be responsible for light-dependent generation of toxic reactive oxygen species putatively contributing to death of symbionts and/or host cells. In some Symbiodiniaceae species, alternative photosynthetic electron flows (AEF) have been documented to occur upon a shift to high temperature, possibly contributing to photoprotection and to the balance of energetic ratio between photoproduced ATP and NADPH. By using a combination of in vivo spectrofluorimetric and oximetric techniques, we studied the capacity for electron rerouting toward oxygen and cyclic electron flow (CEF) around photosystem I in eight Symbiodiniaceae in culture belonging to Symbiodinium and Breviolum genera upon an acute shift from 25 to 33 degrees C. CEF capacity was determined as the kinetic of PSI primary donor P700 re-reduction in the presence of DCMU, a PSII inhibitor. An active oxygen uptake in light was estimated by comparing net oxygen evolution and relative electron transport rate of PSII at different light intensities. Among strains that showed elevated capacity for both AEF, some were thermotolerant while others were thermosensitive. Conversely, in some thermotolerant strains, capacities for these AEF were low upon acute heat stress. A principal component analysis of these results indicates that the long-term heat tolerant/bleached phenotype of cultured Symbiodinium and Breviolum spp. is not correlated with a capacity for different AEF across isolates during early onset of acute heat stress.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",English,"Cardol, P (Corresponding Author), Univ Liege, Genet \& Physiol Microalgues, InBioS Phytosyst, Inst Bot, Liege, Belgium.

The coral response to a change in both light and temperature was also assessed, by subjecting coral to two treatments corresponding to winter (14 C and 30 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and summer (23 C and 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) conditions, as measured in the Ligurian Sea. Photosynthesis, measured using both respirometry and pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry, revealed a linear relationship only at low light levels. At higher irradiance, relative electron transport rate (rETR) approached saturation more slowly than rates of oxygen production. At constant temperature, a change in light did not induce any change in zooxanthellae (zoox) and chlorophyll (Chl a+c(2)) concentrations (mean 3.7x10(6) zoox cm(-2) and 14.1 mu g cm(-2), respectively); however, chlorophyll concentrations significantly increased under low light and temperature, probably in order to maintain a sufficient level of autotrophy. Maximal gross photosynthesis (Pg(max)) as well as the saturation irradiance (E(k)) and the respiration rate (R) were, however, significantly higher at 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) compared to the lower light treatments, independently of temperature conditions. Acclimation to high light appeared to be partly driven by a change in the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) capacity of the algal cells, and to a maximal rate of photon utilization. Conversely, under low light conditions, coral polyps presented a lower E(k), but also lower respiration rates, which correspond to a decrease in the energy expenditure.

The notion that adaptive traits can be retained by transferring the symbionts alone, however, challenges the holobiont concept, a fundamental paradigm in coral research. Holobiont traits are products of a specific community (holobiont) and all its co-evolutionary and local adaptations, which might limit the retention or transference of holobiont traits by exchanging only one partner. Here we evaluate how interchanging partners affect the short- and long-term performance of holobionts under heat stress using clonal lineages of the cnidarian model system Aiptasia (host and Symbiodiniaceae strains) originating from distinct thermal environments. Our results show that holobionts from more thermally variable environments have higher plasticity to heat stress, but this resilience could not be transferred to other host genotypes through the exchange of symbionts. Importantly, our findings highlight the role of the host in determining holobiont productivity in response to thermal stress and indicate that local adaptations of holobionts will likely limit the efficacy of interchanging unfamiliar compartments to enhance thermal tolerance.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Aranda, M (Corresponding Author), King Abdullah Univ Sci \& Technol KAUST, Red Sea Res Ctr RSRC, Biol \& Environm Sci \& Engn Div BESE, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.

This study investigated these hypotheses by comparing the thermal performance of two common tropical coral species found in the Great Barrier Reef with the two most common temperate coral species from the Mediterranean Sea. Photosynthesis rates, dark respiration rates, maximum PSII quantum yield (F-v/F-m) and electron transport rates (rETR(m)) were measured on coral fragments exposed to an acute temperature increase and decrease up to 5 degrees C above and below the average environmental seawater temperature. Dark respiration rates and F-v/F-m increased linearly with temperature, suggesting broad thermal tolerance. For photosynthesis and rETR(m), the performance breadths were surprisingly similar between the tropical and temperate species. However, the thermal optimum for performance was generally below the local average temperature, and only coincided with the prevailing environmental temperature for one of the tropical species. The broad thermal tolerance for photosynthesis displayed in this study supports previous observations that corals can survive short periods of abnormally warm temperatures and suggests that corals adopt thermal generalist strategies to cope with temperature variation in the environment. Nevertheless, current mean temperatures are 10-30\% above the thermal optimum for the species studied here, demonstrating that conditions are already pushing the boundaries of coral thermal tolerance.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"Jurriaans, S (Corresponding Author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci \& Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.

Coral bleaching is the loss of algal symbionts from the coral tissue. The reduction in photosynthates produced by the symbionts makes the survival of the coral dependent on heterotrophy and stored resources, which are catabolized into available energy, i.e., Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). The present study examined how an increase in water temperature affects energetic reserves and available ATP in the Red Sea coral Stylophora pistillata. Following a 9-d hold at 1, 3, 5 degrees C above ambient summer temperature (similar to 26 degrees C), ATP levels in the coral tissue remained constant. Similarly, no significant differences in the stored energy (proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids) of the holobiont were measured. However, half of the coral nubbins in the + 7 degrees C treatment experienced tissue dissociation, while the remaining nubbins bleached with a 34\% decline in stored energy and a decline in respiration and photosynthesis rates by 69 and 72\%, respectively. The + 7 degrees C treated coral nubbins had 75\% lower carbohydrates compared to nubbins at ambient conditions and the lowest carbohydrates to lipid and protein ratio. This study demonstrates that exceeding the high bleaching threshold of S. pistillata in the Gulf of Aqaba is associated with a catabolic response to maintain ATP levels and highlights the energetic cost of thermal stress. Understanding anabolic and catabolic processes in corals under environmental stress is key to understanding their capacity to survive future thermal stress scenarios.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"Kochman, NR (Corresponding Author), Bar Ilan Univ, Goodman Fac Life Sci, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel.

These discrete events are causing widespread stress and mortality in marine ecosystems, including coral reefs. The heat tolerance of different coral species is often complex and depends on a combination of environmental and biological factors, making accurate predictions of the impact of MHWs on individual species challenging. Heating rate has been shown to influence coral bleaching in Acropora species, but it remains unknown how heating rate influences bleaching in other corals with contrasting morphology and bleaching sensitivities. In this study, we explored the sensitivity of Pocillopora damicornis and Plesiastrea versipora, representing branching and encrusting growth forms, respectively, to heating rate. We experimentally simulated MHWs with slow (0.5 degrees C d-1) and fast (1 degrees C d-1) heating rates and measured physiological responses to quantify changes in coral health, including photochemical efficiency, holobiont metabolism, tissue biomass, chl a, and symbiont density. Our results confirm that heating rate is a good predictor of coral bleaching sensitivity for these species, with faster heating rates causing more severe bleaching and declines in coral health. However, bleaching sensitivity differed between P. damicornis and P. versipora, with P. damicornis more affected by the faster heating rate. The use of heating rate, in addition to other metrics such as duration and intensity of heat, will enhance our capacity to predict the local impact of MHW events and their overarching ecological consequences for coral ecosystems.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",English,"Sahin, D (Corresponding Author), Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Crawley 6009, Australia.

Inhibitor concentration range-finding trials aimed to determine the appropriate concentration to generate inhibition of the Calvin-Benson cycle, but avoid other metabolic impacts to the symbiont and the animal host. Both 3 mmol l(-1) GA and 20 mol l(-1) KCN caused minimal inhibition of host respiration, but did induce photosynthetic impairment, measured by a loss of photosystem II function and oxygen production. GA did not affect the severity of bleaching, nor induce bleaching in the absence of thermal stress, suggesting inhibition of the Calvin-Benson cycle by GA does not initiate bleaching in P. damicornis. In contrast, KCN did activate a bleaching response through symbiont expulsion, which occurred in the presence and absence of thermal stress. While KCN is an inhibitor of the Calvin-Benson cycle, it also promotes reactive oxygen species formation, and it is likely that this was the principal agent in the coral bleaching process. These findings do not support the hypothesis that temperature-induced inhibition of the Calvin-Benson cycle alone induces coral bleaching.",COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",English,"Hill, R (Corresponding Author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth \& Environm Sci, Ctr Marine Bioinnovat, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.

Species with broad geographical distributions may be thermal generalists that perform well across a broad range of temperatures, or they might contain subpopulations of locally adapted thermal specialists. We quantified the variation in thermal performance of two coral species, Porites cylindrica and Acropora spp., along a latitudinal gradient over which temperature varies by approximately 68 degrees C. Photosynthesis rates, respiration rates, maximum quantum yield and maximum electron transport rates were measured on coral fragments exposed to an acute temperature increase and decrease up to 58 degrees C above and below the local average temperature. Results showed geographical variation in the performance curves of both species at holobiont and symbiont level, but this did not lead to an alignment of the optimal temperature for performance with the average temperature of the local environment, suggesting suboptimal coral performance of these coral populations in summer. Furthermore, symbiont thermal performance generally had an optimum closer to the average environmental temperature than holobiont performance, suggesting that symbionts have a higher capacity for acclimatization than the coral host, and can aid the coral host when temperatures are unfavourable.

For symbionts within both species, performance was higher at all temperatures in summer, while the thermal optima and performance breadth remained unchanged. Despite these changes in thermal performance, the thermal optima of most traits did not match the ambient environmental temperature, but fell between the summer and winter temperatures.

Octocorals are likely to become key players in future reef communities, but they are still highly under-investigated with regard to their responses to global and local environmental changes. Thus, we evaluated the individual and combined effects of DOC enrichment (10, 20 and 40 mg L(-)1 DOC, added as glucose) and warming (stepwise from 26 to 32 degrees C) on the widespread Indo-Pacific gorgonian Pinnigorgia flava in a 45-day laboratory experiment. Oxygen fluxes (net photosynthesis and respiration), as well as Symbiodiniaceae cell density and coral growth were assessed. Our results highlight a differential ecophysiological response to DOC enrichment and warming as well as their combination. Individual DOC addition did not significantly affect oxygen fluxes nor Symbiodiniaceae cell density and growth, while warming significantly decreased photosynthesis rates and Symbiodiniaceae cell density. When DOC enrichment and warming were combined, no effect on P. flava oxygen fluxes was observed while growth responded to certain DOC conditions depending on the temperature. Our findings indicate that P. flava is insensitive to the individual effect of DOC enrichment, but not to warming and the two stressors combined. This suggests that, if temperature remains below certain thresholds, this gorgonian species may gain a competitive advantage over coral species that are reportedly more affected by DOC eutrophication. However, under the expected increasing temperature scenarios, it is also likely that this octocoral species will be negatively affected, with potential consequences on community structure.

This study investigated the effect of temperature reductions on Montastraea cavemosa and Ponies astreoides in Bermuda (32 degrees N; sea surface temperature similar to 19-29 degrees C) over 5 weeks, applying the following treatments: (i) constant control temperature at 28 degrees C, and (ii) temperature reduction (0.5 degrees C day(-1)) followed by constant temperature (20 days; acclimatization period) at 24 degrees C and (iii) at 20 degrees C. Both species decreased photosynthesis and respiration during temperature reduction as expected, which continued to decrease during the acclimatization period, indicating adjustment to a low energy turnover rather than thermal compensation. Trajectories of physiological adjustments and level of thermal compensation, however, differed between species. Montastraea cavemosa zooxanthellae metrics showed a strong initial response to temperature reduction, followed by a return to close to control values during the acclimatization period, reflecting a high physiological flexibility and low thermal compensation. Ponies astreoides zooxanthellae, in contrast, showed no initial response, but an increase in pigment concentration per zooxanthellae and similar photosynthesis rates at 24 degrees C and 20 degrees C at the end of the experiment, indicating low acute thermal sensitivity and the ability for thermal compensation at the lowest temperature. Respiration decreased more strongly than photosynthesis, leading to significant build-up of biomass in both species (energy reserves). Results are important in the light of potential poleward migration of corals and of potential latitudinal and species-specific differences in coral thermal tolerance.",COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",English,"Sawall, Y (Corresponding Author), Bermuda Inst Ocean Sci BIOS, 17 Ferry Reach, GE-01 St Georges, Bermuda.

However, future reefs are increasingly likely to face combined environmental stressors, further complicating our understanding of how S. trenchii will possibly acclimatize to future climate scenarios. Over a 33-day period, we characterized the individual and combined affects of high temperature (26.5 vs. 31.5 degrees C), pCO(2) (400 vs. 760 mu atm), and elevated nutrients (0.4 and 0.2 vs. 3.5 and 0.3 mu mol of NO3/NO2 and PO43-, respectively) on S. trenchii within the host coral species Turbinaria reniformis. Global analysis across all treatments found temperature to be the largest driver of physiological change. However, exposure to elevated temperature led to changes in symbiont physiology that differed across pCO(2) concentrations. Net photosynthesis and cellular chlorophyll a increased with temperature under ambient pCO(2), whereas temperature-related differences in cellular volume and its affect on pigment packaging were more pronounced under elevated pCO(2). Furthermore, increased nutrients mitigated the physiological response to high temperature under both ambient and elevated pCO(2) conditions and represented a significant interaction between all three physical parameters. Individual responses to temperature and pCO(2) were also observed as cellular density declined with elevated temperature and calcification along with respiration rates declined with increased pCO(2). Symbiodinium trenchii remained the dominant symbiont population within the host across all treatment combinations. Our results reveal distinct physiological changes in response to high temperature within the S. trenchii/T. reniformis symbioses that are dependent on pCO(2) and nutrient concentration, and represent important interactive effects to consider as we consider how corals will respond under future climate change scenarios.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",English,"Hoadley, KD (Corresponding Author), Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci \& Policy, Lewes, DE 19958 USA.

Astrangia poculata is a temperate scleractinian coral that provides unique opportunities to understand the roles of phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary adaptation in coral physiological tolerance limits. This species inhabits hard-bottom ecosystems from the northwestern Atlantic to the Gulf of Mexico and withstands an annual temperature range of up to 20 degrees C. Additionally, A. poculata is facultatively symbiotic and co-occurs in both symbiotic ('brown') and aposymbiotic ('white') states. Here, brown and white A. poculata were collected from Virginia (VA) and Rhode Island (RI), USA, and exposed to heat (18-32 degrees C) and cold (18-6 degrees C) stress, during which respiration of the coral host along with photosynthesis and photochemical efficiency (F-v/F-m) of Breviolum psygmophilum photosymbionts were measured. Thermal performance curves (TPCs) of respiration revealed a pattern of countergradient variation with RI corals exhibiting higher respiration rates overall, and specifically at 6, 15, 18, 22 and 26 degrees C. Additionally, thermal optimum (T-opt) analyses show a 3.8 degrees C (brown) and 6.9 degrees C (white) higher T-opt in the VA population, corresponding to the warmer in situ thermal environment in VA. In contrast to respiration, no origin effect was detected in photosynthesis rates or F-v/F-m, suggesting a possible host-only signature of adaptation. This study is the first to consider A. poculata's response to both heat and cold stress across symbiotic states and geography, and provides insight into the potential evolutionary mechanisms behind the success of this species along the East Coast of the USA.",COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",English,"Aichelman, HE (Corresponding Author), Old Dominion Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 110 Mills Godwin Life Sci Bldg, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.

However, the detailed physiological responses of LBF holobionts to temperature ranges occurring in their habitats are not known. We report net oxygen (O-2) production and respiration rates of three LBF holobionts (Baculogypsina sphaerulata and Calcarina gaudichaudii hosting diatom symbionts, and Amphisorus kudakajimensis hosting dinoflagellate symbionts) measured in the laboratory at water temperatures ranging from 5 degrees C to 45 degrees C in 2.5 degrees C or 5 degrees C intervals and with light saturation levels of similar to 500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). In addition, the recovery of net O-2 production and respiration rates after exposure to temperature stress was assessed. The net O-2 production and respiration rates of the three LBF holobionts peaked at similar to 30 degrees C, indicating their optimal temperature for a short exposure period. At extreme high temperatures (>= 40 degrees C), the net O-2 production rates of all three LBF holobionts declined to less than zero and the respiration rates slightly decreased, indicating that photosynthesis of algal symbionts was inactivated. At extreme low temperatures (<= 10 degrees C for two calcarinid species and <= 5 degrees C for A. kudakajimensis), the net O-2 production and respiration rates were near zero, indicating a weakening of holobiont activity. After exposure to extreme high or low temperature, the net O-2 production rates did not recover until the following day, whereas the respiration rates recovered rapidly, suggesting that a longer time (days) is required for recovery from damage to the photosystem by temperature stress compared to the respiration system. These results indicate that the oxygen metabolism of LBF holobionts can generally cope well with conditions that fluctuate diurnally and seasonally in their habitats. However, temporal heat and cold stresses with high light levels may induce severe damage to algal symbionts and also damage to host foraminifers.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",English,"Fujita, K (Corresponding Author), Univ Ryukyus, Dept Phys \& Earth Sci, Nishihara, Okinawa 90301, Japan.

However, increasingly frequent heat waves lead to coral mass-bleaching events and pose a serious threat to the survival of reef ecosystems. Despite significant efforts, a mechanistic understanding of coral-algal symbiosis functioning, what leads to its breakdown and what can prevent it, remains incomplete. The main obstacles are low amenability of corals to experimental handling and, owing to its obligatory nature, the difficulties of manipulating the coral-algal association. Indeed, many studies on the symbiotic partnership are conducted on other cnidarian model organisms and their results may therefore not be fully transferable to tropical reef-building corals. Here, we identify the tropical stony coral species Galaxea fascicularis as a novel candidate coral model system. Individual polyps of this species can be separated, enabling highly replicated genotype studies, and are well suited to experimental investigation of the symbiosis as they can be easily and effectively rid of their algal symbionts (bleached). We show that bleached adult individuals can reestablish symbiosis with non-native symbionts, and we report the completion of the gametogenic cycle ex situ, with the successful spawning in aquaria over multiple years. These achievements help overcome several of the major limitations to direct research on corals and highlight the potential of G. fascicularis as an important new model system for investigations of symbiosis functioning and manipulation.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"Ziegler, M (Corresponding Author), Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Anim Ecol \& Systemat, Marine Holobi Lab, Heinrich Buff Ring 26-32 IFZ, D-35392 Giessen, Germany.

Aposymbiotic P. verweyi from the NPP-OL site had a 3.1 degrees C higher threshold RBT than those from WLT. In addition, MDH activity in P. verweyi from NPP-OL showed higher thermal resistance than those from WLT by higher optimum temperatures and the activation energy required for inactivating the enzyme by heat. The MDH from NPP-OL also had two times higher residual activity than that from WLT after incubation at 50 degrees C for 1 h.

The temperature was 1-3 degrees C higher than the mean summer value (24 degrees C) and remained high over a long period. During these summers, mass-mortality events, affecting several sessile benthic species, were reported. In the present study, we tested the long-term (3-7 weeks) effect of different temperatures (20 degrees C measured in spring and autumn, 24 degrees C observed in summer, and 26 degrees C and 28 degrees C abnormal summer values) on two Mediterranean corals, Cladocora caespitosa and Oculina patagonica. Growth rate, photosynthetic efficiency (F-v/F-m), relative electron transport rate (ETR), zooxanthellae and chlorophyll (chl) contents were measured during 48 days incubation. At 20 degrees C, all parameters remained constant during the whole experiment for both species. At higher temperatures, most physiological parameters were affected by only 2-5 weeks at 24 degrees C, and were severely depressed at higher temperatures. Small replicate samples (nubbins) of O. patagonica significantly decreased their zooxanthellae and chl concentrations at all temperatures, after 2 weeks of incubation. Their F-v/F-m values, as well as their growth rates, were also gradually reduced during the incubation at all temperatures. However, only a few nubbins maintained at 28 degrees C showed signs of tissue necrosis after 34 days, and these gradually recovered tissue when temperature was returned to normal. In nubbins of C. caespitosa, chl and zooxanthellae concentrations decreased only after 34 days of incubation at 26 degrees C and 28 degrees C. At the same time, tissue necrosis was observed, explaining the loss of the symbionts. F-v/F-m was reduced only after 34 days of incubation at the different temperatures, and growth rate was first enhanced, before collapsing by 30\% at 24 degrees C and by 90-100\% at 26 degrees C and 28 degrees C. All samples maintained at 26 degrees C and 28 degrees C had died, due to tissue necrosis, by the end of the experiment. Results obtained suggest that O. patagonica is more able than C. caespitosa to resist high temperature conditions because of its rapid bleaching capacity.

This study investigated whether differences in physiological responses to temperature are consistent with regional differences in temperature regimes for the stony coral Oculina patagonica. To resolve this question, we experimentally assessed how colonies originating from four different locations characterized by >3 degrees C variation in mean maximum annual temperature responded to warming from 20 to 32 degrees C. We assessed plasticity in symbiont identity, density, and photosynthetic properties, together with changes in host tissue biomass. Results show that, without changes in the type of symbiont hosted by coral colonies, O. patagonica has limited capacity to acclimatize to future warming. We found little evidence of variation in overall thermal tolerance, or in thermal optima, in response to spatial variation in ambient temperature. Given that the invader O. patagonica is a relatively new member of the Mediterranean coral fauna, our results also suggest that coral populations may need to remain isolated for a long period of time for thermal adaptation to potentially take place. Our study indicates that for O. patagonica, mortality associated with thermal stress manifests primarily through tissue breakdown under moderate but prolonged warming (which does not impair symbiont photosynthesis and, therefore, does not lead to bleaching). Consequently, projected global warming is likely to cause repeat incidents of partial and whole colony mortality and might drive a gradual range contraction of Mediterranean corals.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Rodolfo-Metalpa, R (Corresponding Author), Inst Rech Dev, Unite 227 CoReus 2, Noumea, New Caledonia.

This is particularly relevant for tropical organisms living close to their thermal optimum, well exemplified by the increasing fre-quency of bleaching occurrence in shallow-water corals. Mesophotic Coral Ecosystems (MCEs) were suggested as potential oases, especially when they are submitted to internal waves inducing short-term cooling events. Indeed, probability of bleaching occurrence in scleractinians was reported to decrease with depth in Mo'orea as tem-perature variability increases. However, ecophysiological data are currently lacking to understand the cause of lower susceptibility/increased plasticity of deeper corals. A growing interest has been devoted the last decade to MCEs, but our understanding of the physiological performance of benthic organisms living in this environment remains relatively unexplored. To tackle that question, we first compared the metabolic responses (dark respi-ration, net photosynthesis and photosynthetic efficiency) of the depth-generalist scleractinian Pachyseris speciosa from two heterogeneous thermal environment (25 and 85 m depths) to acute heat stress to determine if the local thermal environment could predict coral response to warming. Then, we tested the thermal performance of two sympatric species (the scleractinian P. speciosa and the antipatharian Stichopathes sp.) to determine if there are inter-species differences in performances in species experiencing identical levels of temperature variability, at mesophotic depths (85 m). Results revealed broader thermal performances in the mesophotic P. speciosa compared to mid-depth ones, and constrained performances in the mesophotic antipatharian compared to the scleractinian species. We hypothesize that the high fluctuations in temperature due to internal waves in deeper areas contribute to the broader thermal performances of mesophotic P. speciosa. However, the constrained performances of the mesophotic antipatharian compared to P. speciosa suggests that other processes than the symbiosis with zooxanthellae also influence thermal performances of these mesophotic organisms. Our results supported that Stichopathes sp. lives close to its thermal optimum, suggesting a (relatively) cold thermal specialist strategy. In this context, composition of MCEs in the future is unlikely to shift to antipatharian-dominated landscape and will remain coral-dominated landscape.",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",English,"Godefroid, M (Corresponding Author), Univ Libre Bruxelles, Ave FD Roosevelt 50,CP160-15, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.

To characterize the physiological response of some common Mediterranean gorgonians to fluctuations in temperature, four species (Paramuricea clavata, Eunicella singularis, Eunicella cavolinii and Corallium rubrum) were maintained in aquaria, in which the temperature was increased every ten days with increments of 2-3 degrees C, starting at 14 degrees C, ending at 25 degrees C. Oxygen consumption, number of open/closed polyps and percentage of necrotic tissue were monitored. All species showed similar activity patterns with increasing temperature. P. clavata and E. singularis showed the highest respiration rate at 18 degrees C, E. cavolinii and C rubrum at 20 degrees C. Above these temperatures, both oxygen consumption and polyp reactivity decreased in all species. The present data confirm a reduction of the metabolic activity in Mediterranean gorgonians during periods of high temperature. At temperatures above 18 degrees C, the percentage of open polyps (considered as a parameter to evaluate polyps reactivity) decreased, thus mirroring the trend of oxygen consumption. The average values of Q(10) indicated that gorgonians have a definite temperature limit over which the metabolism (oxygen consumption) stop to follow the temperature increase. After three days at 25 degrees C, metabolic activity in E. cavolinii, C. rubrum and P. clavata further decreased and the first signs of necrosis were observed. At this temperature, activity remained unchanged in E. singularis. This species seems to more resistant to thermal stress. The symbiotic zooxanthellae present in this species are likely to provide an alternative source of energy when polyps reduce their feeding activity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

To determine the role of zooxanthellae in the bleaching process, aposymbiotic sea anemones from Bermuda (Aiptasia pallida) were infected with symbionts from other sea anemones (Aiptasia pallida from Florida, Bartholomea annulata and Condylactis gigantea). The expulsion of algae was measured during 24-h incubations at 25, 32 and 34 degreesC. Photosynthetic rates of freshly isolated zooxanthellae were also measured at these temperatures. The C. gigantea (Cg) symbionts were expelled in higher numbers than the other algae at 32 degreesC. Photosynthesis by the Cg algae was completely inhibited at this temperature, in contrast to the other symbionts. At 34 degrees all of the symbionts had increased expulsion rates, and at this temperature only the symbionts from Florida A. pallida exhibited any photosynthesis. These results provide the first evidence that the differential release of symbionts from the same host species is related to decreased photosynthesis at elevated temperatures, and support other findings suggesting that zooxanthellae are directly affected by elevated temperatures during bleaching events.

For species with strong symbiotic relationships, such as many coral reef species, genetic variation in symbiont responses to temperature may affect the response to increased ocean temperatures. To assess variation among symbiont genotypes, we examined the population dynamics and physiological responses of genotypes of Breviolum antillogorgium in response to increased temperature. We found broad temperature tolerance across genotypes, with all genotypes showing positive growth at 26, 30, and 32 degrees C. Genotypes differed in the magnitude of the response of growth rate and carrying capacity to increasing temperature, suggesting that natural selection could favor different genotypes at different temperatures. However, the historical temperature at which genotypes were reared (26 or 30 degrees C) was not a good predictor of contemporary temperature response. We found increased photosynthetic rates and decreased respiration rates with increasing contemporary temperature, and differences in physiology among genotypes, but found no significant differences in the response of these traits to temperature among genotypes.

In this work, we first question whether there is an energetic coupling between photosynthesis and respiration in Symbiodiniaceae (Symbiodinium,DurusdiniumandEffrenium), and second, how different levels of energetic coupling will affect their adaptive responses to global warming. Coupling between photosynthesis and respiration was established by determining the variation of metabolic rates during thermal response curves, and how inhibition of respiration affects photosynthesis. Adaptive (irreversible) responses were studied by exposing twoSymbiodiniumspecies with different levels of photosynthesis-respiration interaction to high temperature conditions (32 degrees C) for 1 yr. We found that some Symbiodiniaceae have a high level of energetic coupling; that is, photosynthesis and respiration have the same temperature dependency, and photosynthesis is negatively affected when respiration is inhibited. Conversely, photosynthesis and respiration are not coupled in other species. In any case, prolonged exposure to high temperature caused adjustments in both photosynthesis and respiration, but these changes were fully reversible.

In tightly linked mutualisms, evolutionary rescue may occur through evolution of the host and/or endosymbionts. Many obligate mutualisms are composed of relatively small, fast-growing symbionts with greater potential to evolve on ecologically relevant time scales than their relatively large, slower growing hosts. Numerous jellyfish species harbor closely related endosymbiont taxa to other cnidarian species such as coral, and are commonly used as a model system for investigating cnidarian mutualisms. We examined the potential for adaptation of the upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea xamachana to increased temperature via evolution of its microalgal endosymbiont, Symbiodinium microadriaticum. We quantified trait variation among five algal genotypes in response to three temperatures (26 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 32 degrees C) and fitness of hosts infected with each genotype. All genotypes showed positive growth rates at each temperature, but rates of respiration and photosynthesis decreased with increased temperature. Responses varied among genotypes but were unrelated to genetic similarity. The effect of temperature on asexual reproduction and the timing of development in the host also depended on the genotype of the symbiont. Natural selection could favor different algal genotypes at different temperatures, affecting host fitness.

The genus Symbiodinium exhibits high genetic diversity with physiological variation within and among species, leading to a range of thermal tolerance. Although these variations have been examined in individual species, comprehensive comparative experimental data across several species are still rare. Therefore, in the present study, the photophysiological and thermal response patterns of six genetically characterized Symbiodinium genotypes were comparatively investigated. The six Symbiodinium genotypes were isolated from four different host species from the following biogeographic locations: Hawaii (Central Pacific), Panama (Caribbean), Florida (Caribbean), and Palau (West Pacific). Photosynthesis-irradiance curve and growth measurements at temperatures ranging from 20 to 33 A degrees C were carried out. All physiological data clearly indicate significant differences in the response patterns of the six Symbiodinium genotypes. While some types photosynthesized, respired, and grew at 33 A degrees C, others showed a partial or complete inhibition. The genotype-specific response over the experimental temperature reveals the potential range response of a given symbiont and variation between strains that adaptation might act upon.",SPRINGER,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",English,"Karsten, U (Corresponding Author), Univ Rostock, Inst Biol Sci Appl Ecol \& Phycol, Albert Einstein Str 3, D-18501 Rostock, Germany.

This symbiosis is disrupted by thermally induced coral bleaching, a stress response in which the coral host expels its algal symbionts as they become physiologically impaired. The disruption of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) supply or the thermal inactivation of Rubisco have been proposed as sites of initial thermal damage that leads to the bleaching response. Symbiodinium possesses a highly unusual Form II ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), which exhibits a lower CO2:O-2 specificity and may be more thermally unstable than the Form I Rubiscos of other algae and land plants. Components of the CO2 concentrating mechanism (CCM), which supplies inorganic carbon for photosynthesis, may also be temperature sensitive. Here, we examine the ability of four cultured Symbiodinium strains to acquire and fix DIC across a temperature gradient. Surprisingly, the half-saturation constant of photosynthesis with respect to DIC concentration (K (P)), an index of CCM function, declined with increasing temperature in three of the four strains, indicating a greater potential for photosynthetic carbon acquisition at elevated temperatures. In the fourth strain, there was no effect of temperature on K (P). Finding no evidence for thermal inhibition of the CCM, we conclude that CCM components are not likely to be the primary sites of thermal damage. Reduced photosynthetic quantum yields, a hallmark of thermal bleaching, were observed at low DIC concentrations, leaving open the possibility that reduced inorganic carbon availability is involved in bleaching.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"Hopkinson, BM (Corresponding Author), Univ Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA.

In past studies of this ``bleaching{'' phenomenon, there has been an underlying assumption that temperature adversely affects the animal hosts, the algae thereby being relegated to a more passive role. Because photosynthesis is a sensitive indicator of thermal stress in plants and has a central role in the nutrition of symbiotic invertebrates, we have tested the hypothesis that elevated temperature adversely affects photosynthesis in the symbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium microadriaticum. The results, based on analyses of light-mediated O2 evolution and in vivo fluorescence, indicate that photosynthesis is impaired at temperatures above 30-degrees-C and ceases completely at 34-36-degrees-C.

Here, we sought to determine whether such preconditioning is underpinned by differential regulation of aerobic respiration. We quantified in vivo metabolism and mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activity in the naturally symbiotic sea anemone Exaiptasia pallida preconditioned to 30 degrees C for > 7 weeks as well as anemones kept at 26 degrees C. Preconditioning resulted in increased Symbiodinium photosynthetic activity and holobiont (host+ symbiont) respiration rates. Biomassnormalised activities of host respiratory enzymes {[}citrate synthase and the mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC) complexes I and IV] were higher in preconditioned animals, suggesting that increased holobiont respiration may have been due to host mitochondrial biogenesis and/or enlargement. Subsequent acute heating of preconditioned and ` thermally naive' animals to 33 degrees C induced dramatic increases in host mETC complex I and Symbiodinium mETC complex II activities only in thermally naive E. pallida. These changes were not reflected in the activities of other respiratory enzymes. Furthermore, bleaching in preconditioned E. pallida (defined as the significant loss of symbionts) was delayed by several days relative to the thermally naive group.

Examination of two of the proposed lesion points, the carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM) and form II Rubisco, indicate that, over the temperature range examined, the CCM is not disrupted in Symbiodinium isolated from giant clams, however it was not possible to determine if Rubisco is the point of thermal lesion resulting in bleaching.

Exposure of Stylophora pistillata to 33 and 34 degrees C for 4 h resulted in (1) the development of strong non-photochemical quenching (qN) of the chlorophyll fluorescence signal, (2) marked decreases in photosynthetic oxygen evolution, and (3) decreases in optimal quantum yield (F-v/F-m) of photosystern II (PSII), Quantum yield decreased to a greater extent on the illuminated surfaces of coral branches than on lower (shaded) surfaces, and also when high irradiance intensities were combined with elevated temperature (33 degrees C as opposed to 28 degrees C), qN collapsed in heat-stressed samples when quenching analysis was conducted in the absence of oxygen, Collectively, these observations are interpreted as the initiation of photoprotective dissipation of excess absorbed energy as heat (qN) and O-2-dependent electron flow through the Mehler-Ascorbate-Peroxidase cycle (MAP-cycle) following the point at which the rate of light-driven electron transport exceeds the capacity of the Calvin cycle. A model for coral bleaching is proposed whereby the primary site of heat damage in S, pistillata is carboxylation within the Calvin cycle, as has been observed during heat damage in higher plants, Damage to PSII and a reduction in F-v/F-m (i.e. photoinhibition) are secondary effects following the overwhelming of photoprotective mechanisms by light. This secondary factor increases the effect of the primary variable, temperature. Potential restrictions of electron flow in heat-stressed zooxanthellae are discussed with respect to Calvin cycle enzymes and the unusual status of the dinoflagellate Rubisco, Significant features of our model are that (1) damage to PSII is not the initial step in the sequence of heat stress in zooxanthellae, acid (2) light plays a key secondary role in the initiation of the bleaching phenomena.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Hoegh-Guldberg, O (Corresponding Author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.

Many sea anemones, corals and jellies in the phylum Cnidaria form endosymbiotic relationships with Symbiodinium spp. (phylum Dinoflagellata) supply the hosts with fixed carbon from photosynthesis. Much work has focused on the generally negative effects of rising temperature and OA on calcification in Symbiodinium-coral symbioses, but has not directly measured symbiont photosynthesis in hospite or fixed carbon translocation from symbiont to host. Symbiodinium species or types vary in their environmental tolerance and photosynthetic capacity; therefore, primary production in symbiotic associations can vary with symbiont type. However, symbiont type has not been identified in a large portion of Symbiodinium-cnidarian studies. Future climate conditions and OA may favor non-calcifying, soft-bodied cnidarians, including zoanthids. Here we show that two zoanthid species, Palythoa sp. and Zoanthus sp., harboring different symbiont types (C1 and A4), had very different responses to increased temperature and increased partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)), or dissolved CO2, and low pH. Thermal stress did not affect carbon fixation or fixed carbon translocation in the Zoanthus sp./A4 association, and high pCO(2)/low pH increased carbon fixation. In contrast, both thermal stress and high pCO(2)/low pH greatly inhibited carbon fixation in the Palythoa sp./C1 association. However, the combined treatment of high temperature and high pCO(2) increased carbon fixation relative to the treatment of high temperature alone. Our observations support the growing body of evidence that demonstrates that the response of symbiotic cnidarians to thermal stress and OA must be considered on a host-specific and symbiont-specific basis. In addition, we show that the effects of increased temperature and pCO(2) on photosynthesis may change when these two stressors are combined. Understanding how carbon fixation and translocation varies among different host-symbiont combinations is critical to predicting which Symbiodinium associations may persist in warm, acidified oceans.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Graham, ER (Corresponding Author), USDA ARS, Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, 2030 SE Marine Sci Dr, Newport, OR 97365 USA.

One of these species, Symbiodinium muscatinei LaJeunesse et Trench, has a broad latitudinal distribution, occurring in intertidal anemones from Washington state to Southern California. To investigate whether high thermal tolerance contributes to the ability of S. muscatinei to inhabit anemones from northern and southern regions, the upper thermal tolerance limit for photosynthesis of symbionts in northern (48 degrees 24' N) populations of A. elegantissima was determined by subjecting anemones to a gradual increase in temperature from 12 degrees C to 30 degrees C over a 10-week period. Light-saturated photosynthetic rates of isolated zooxanthellae were the same over the range of 12 degrees C-24 degrees C and declined significantly at 26 degrees C, which is 14 degrees C and 5 degrees C above average summertime seawater temperatures in northern Puget Sound and Southern California, respectively. At 28 degrees C, zooxanthellae isolated from the anemones, and those expelled by their hosts, exhibited extremely low rates of photosynthesis and highly reduced chl content. The photosynthetic rates and chl content of expelled zooxanthellae were lower than those of retained zooxanthellae.

However, their response mechanisms to elevated temperature exposure are poorly understood. In this study, the physiological and transcriptional responses of Effrenium voratum (Symbiodiniaceae) to ocean warming were examined. After exposure to 30 degrees C, no significant variations in growth, chlorophyll a, or photosynthetic and respiration rates were observed, while a higher temperature (34 degrees C) significantly reduced these physiological measurements. Meanwhile, lipid content and fatty acid composition were altered at high temperature (i.e., elevated degree of fatty acid saturation). Such biochemical constituents likely contributed to the mitigation of the negative effects of elevated temperatures. Furthermore, higher expression levels of genes related to the synthesis and elongation of fatty acids were detected at high temperature.

Environmental stressors often determine the vertical position of each zonation band. These stressors may similarly affect the distribution pattern of endogenous species in their intertidal hosts. To evaluate this possibility, we investigated the distribution pattern of endosymbiotic zooxanthellae in the genus Symbiodinium in a population of the intertidal sea anemone Anthopleura uchidai. We used molecular genetics to identify the Symbiodinium clades and found that A. uchidai has two clades of Symbiodinium, clades A and F. These Symbiodinium clades were disproportionally distributed along the vertical gradient of the intertidal shore. Anemones on the upper shore exclusively possessed clade F Symbiodinium while clade A Symbiodinium became dominant in the sea anemones on the lower shore. Photosynthesis activity assays showed that these Symbiodinium clades had similar net productivities at 23.3 and 31.8 A degrees C at all irradiance levels. At 35 A degrees C, however, clade A Symbiodinium exhibited substantially lower net productivities than clade F Symbiodinium, demonstrating that these Symbiodinium clades have distinct tolerances to thermal stress.

The normal annual temperature range for this coral in Port Phillip Bay (Victoria) (approximately 10-21 degreesC) is well below the physiological optimum for the majority of hermatypic corals (25-29 degreesC). The rate of photosynthesis and respiration in Plesiastrea generally increased with temperature before levelling out at the higher temperatures, with Q(10) data suggesting that both photosynthesis and respiration in Plesiastrea acclimate to changing temperatures. Respiration showed a similar trend to photosynthesis, with respect to temperature, but with a slightly lower rate of increase. Photosynthetic rate in Plesiastrea is comparable with that of reef corals despite lower temperatures and irradiance. When expressed as a function of chlorophyll a content photosynthesis approached perfect temperature compensation with prolonged exposure to various temperatures. Temperature-dependent changes with chlorophyll content may be responsible for temperature related changes in photosynthetic rate. This may be a mechanism for stabilising the symbiotic relationship over a wide temperature range. Autotrophic ability, estimated from photosynthesis/respiration (P/R) ratios, was greatest at higher temperatures and was only slightly less than that of reef corals. At low temperatures Plesiastrea may be dependent on heterotrophic feeding. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Excess nutrient enrichment can make corals more vulnerable to ocean warming by suppressing calcification and reducing photosynthetic performance. However, in some environments, corals can exhibit higher growth rates and thermal performance in response to nutrient enrichment. In this study, we measured how chronic nutrient enrichment at low concentrations affected coral physiology, including endosymbiont and coral host response variables, and holobiont metabolic responses of Pocillopora spp. colonies in Mo'orea, French Polynesia. We experimentally enriched corals with dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate for 15 months on an oligotrophic fore reef in Mo'orea. We first characterized symbiont and coral physiological traits due to enrichment and then used thermal performance curves to quantify the relationship between metabolic rates and temperature for experimentally enriched and control coral colonies. We found that endosymbiont densities and total tissue biomass were 54\% and 22\% higher in nutrient-enriched corals, respectively, relative to controls. Algal endosymbiont nitrogen content cell(-1) was 44\% lower in enriched corals relative to the control colonies. In addition, thermal performance metrics indicated that the maximal rate of performance for gross photosynthesis was 29\% higher and the rate of oxygen evolution at a reference temperature (26.8 degrees C) for gross photosynthesis was 33\% higher in enriched colonies compared to the control colonies. These differences were not attributed to symbiont community composition between corals in different treatments, as C42, a symbiont type in the Cladocopium genus, was the dominant endosymbiont type found in all corals. Together, our results show that in an oligotrophic fore reef environment, nutrient enrichment can cause changes in coral endosymbiont physiology that increase the performance of the coral holobiont.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"Becker, DM (Corresponding Author), Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA.

Deviation outside this range causes physiological impairment of reef-building corals, potentially leading to coral colony death. In January and February 2010, two closely spaced cold fronts, possibly driven by an unusually extreme Arctic Oscillation, caused sudden and severe seawater temperature declines in the Florida Keys. Inshore coral reefs {[}e. g., Admiral Reef (ADM)] experienced lower sustained temperatures (i.e., < 12 degrees C) than those further offshore {[}e. g., Little Grecian Reef (LG), minimum temperature = 17.2 degrees C]. During February and March 2010, we surveyed ADM and observed a mass die-off of reef-building corals, whereas 12 km away LG did not exhibit coral mortality. We subsequently measured the physiological effects of low-temperature stress on three common reef-building corals (i.e., Montastraea faveolata, Porites astreoides, and Siderastrea siderea) over a range of temperatures that replicated the inshore cold-water anomaly (i.e., from 20 to 16 to 12 degrees C and back to 20 degrees C). Throughout the temperature modulations, coral respiration as well as endosymbiont gross photosynthesis and maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II were measured. In addition, Symbiodinium genotypic identity, cell densities, and chlorophyll a content were determined at the beginning and conclusion of the experiment. All corals were significantly affected at 12 degrees C, but species-specific physiological responses were found indicating different coral and/or Symbiodinium cold tolerances. Montastraea faveolata and P. astreoides appeared to be most negatively impacted because, upon return to 20 degrees C, significant reductions in gross photosynthesis and dark respiration persisted. Siderastrea siderea, however, readily recovered to pre-treatment rates of dark respiration and gross photosynthesis. Visual surveys of inshore reefs corroborated these results, with S. siderea being minimally affected by the cold-water anomaly, whereas M. faveolata and P. astreoides exhibited nearly 100\% mortality. This study highlights the importance of understanding the physiological attributes of genotypically distinct coral-Symbiodinium symbioses that contribute to tolerance, recovery, and consequences to an environmental perturbation. These data also document effects of a rarely studied environmental stressor, possibly initiated by remote global climate events, on coral-Symbiodinium symbioses and coral reef communities.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",English,"Kemp, DW (Corresponding Author), Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.

Here, we characterized the functional relationship between temperature (27-33 degrees C) and larval performance of the reef coral Pocillopora damicornis under two pCO(2) levels. The results showed that the temperature threshold of larvae was between 32 and 33 degrees C, as evidenced by the abrupt declines in photochemical efficiency and symbiont density, whereas no oxidative damage was observed between 27 and 33 degrees C and elevated pCO(2) did not influence any of these parameters. In addition, larval respiration and photosynthesis rates exhibited parabolic responses to temperature, and this relationship conformed to the Gaussian-Gompertz model with an optimal temperature around 31.5 degrees C, which was approximately 2.5 degrees C above the summer mean temperature, suggesting the potential for thermal acclimation. Most importantly, elevated pCO(2) significantly enhanced the larval photosynthesis and the stimulatory effect of elevated pCO(2) on the photosynthetic rates and capacity was more pronounced in cool and warm temperatures, indicative of shifted thermal sensitivity under high pCO(2).

Instead, I explain how emerging evidence links fast skeletal extension rates with elevated coral-algae (symbiotic) respiration rates, most-often mediated by nutrient-enlarged symbiont populations and/or rising sea temperatures. Elevated respiration rates can act to reduce the autotrophic capacity (photosynthesis:respiration ratio) of the symbiosis. This restricts the capacity of the coral host to build and maintain sufficient energy reserves (e.g. lipids) needed to sustain essential homeostatic functions, including sexual reproduction and biophysical stress resistance. Moreover, it explains the somewhat paradoxical scenario, whereby at the ecological instant before the reef-building capacity of the symbiosis is lost, a reef can look visually at its best and be accreting CaCO3 at its maximum.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Wooldridge, SA (Corresponding Author), Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia.

It forms deep-water coral reefs and carbonate mounds supporting diverse animal communities on the continental shelf and on seamounts. These recently discovered ecosystems have been damaged by deep-sea fishing and are threatened by predicted shallowing of the aragonite saturation horizon. Despite this, very little is known about the ecophysiology of L. pertusa and its likely response to environmental changes. Here we describe the first study of the respiratory physiology of L. pertusa and the effects of altered temperature and oxygen level. This study shows that L. pertusa can maintain respiratory independence over a range Of PO2 illustrated by a high regulation value (R=78\%). The critical PO2 value of 9-10 kPa is very similar to the lower values of oxygen concentration recorded in the field. This suggests that oxygen level may be a limiting factor in the distribution of this cold-water coral. L. pertusa survived periods of anoxia (I h), hypoxia (up to 96 h), but high Q(10) values revealed sensitivity to short-term temperature changes (6.5-11 degrees C. For the first time vital data have been gathered on the physiology of this species that is essential to understand distribution and underpin future climate change studies. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In the Persian Gulf, coral reefs are confronted with a high seasonal variability in water temperature, and both hot and cold extremes have been associated with episodes of coral bleaching and mortality. Using physiological performance as a measure of coral health, we investigated the thermal susceptibility of the common acroporid, Acropora downingi, near Hengam Island where the temperature oscillates seasonally in the range 20.2-34.2 degrees C. In a series of two short-term experiments comparing coral response in summer versus winter conditions, we exposed corals during each season (1) to the corresponding seasonal average and extreme temperature levels in a static thermal environment, and (2) to a progressive temperature deviation from the annual mean toward the corresponding extreme seasonal value and beyond in a dynamic thermal environment. We monitored four indictors of coral physiological performance: net photosynthesis (Pn), dark respiration (R), autotrophic capability (Pn/R), and survival. Corals exposed to warming during summer showed a decrease in net photosynthesis and ultimately died, while corals exposed to cooling during winter were not affected in their photosynthetic performance and survival. Coral autotrophic capability Pn/R was lower at the warmer thermal level within eachseason, and during summer compared to winter. Corals exposed to the maximum temperature of summer displayed Pn/R < 1, inferring that photosynthetic performance could not support basal metabolic needs under this environment. Our results suggest that the autotrophic performance of the Persian Gulf A. downingi is sensitive to the extreme temperatures endured in summer, and therefore its populations may be impacted by future increases in water temperature.",PEERJ INC,"341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND",English,"Samiei, JV (Corresponding Author), Iranian Natl Inst Oceanog \& Atmospher Sci, Tehran, Iran.

Reef-building corals are sensitive to temperature due to their endosymbiotic relationship with single-celled dinoflagellates, with mass mortality events increasing in frequency and magnitude. The purpose of this study was to quantify the thermal sensitivity of important physiological functions of a Caribbean reef-building coral, Orbicella franksi, through the measurement of thermal performance curves (TPCs). We compared TPC metrics (thermal optimum, critical maximum, activation energy, deactivation energy, and rate at a standardized temperature) between two populations at the northern and southern extents of the geographic range of O. franksi. We further compared essential coral organismal processes (gross photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification) within a site to determine which function is most sensitive to thermal stress using a hierarchical Bayesian-modeling approach. We found evidence for differences in thermal performance, which could be due to thermal adaptation or acclimatization, with higher TPC metrics (thermal optimum and critical maximum) in warmer Panama, compared to cooler Bermuda. We also documented the hierarchy in thermal sensitivity of essential organismal functions within a population: respiration was less sensitive than photosynthesis, which was less sensitive than calcification.

In particular, they disrupt the relationship between corals and their dinoflagellate symbionts (bleaching). However, some coral species can afford either high temperatures or nutrient enrichment and their study can bring new insights into how corals acclimate or adapt to stressors. Here, we focused on the role of the nutrient history in influencing the response of the Mediterranean scleractinian coral Cladocora caespitosa to thermal stress. Colonies living naturally in nutrient-poor (<0.5 mu M nitrogen, <0.2 mu M phosphorus, LN) and nutrient-rich (ca. 10-20 mu M nitrogen, 0.4 mu M phosphorus, HN) locations were sampled, maintained under the right nutrient conditions, and exposed to a temperature increase from 17 degrees C to 24 degrees C and 29 degrees C. While both HN and LN colonies decreased their concentrations of symbionts and/or photosynthetic pigments, HN colonies were able to maintain significant higher rates of net and gross photosynthesis at 24 degrees C compared to LN colonies. In addition, while there was no change in protein concentration in HN corals during the experiment, proteins continuously decreased in LN corals with increased temperature. These results are important in that they show that nutrient history can influence the response of scleractinian corals to thermal stress. Further investigations of under-studied coral groups are thus required in the future to understand the processes leading to coral resistance to environmental perturbations.",NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",English,"Hadjioannou, L (Corresponding Author), Univ Cyprus, Dept Biol Sci, Nicosia, Cyprus.

A temperature of 25 degrees C and a light intensity of 200 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1) was the starting culture condition. Metabolic (photosynthesis, respiration, calcification and surface expansion rate) and geochemical measurements (delta O-18, delta C-13, Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca) were conducted on 6 colonies for each experimental condition. Metabolic measurements confirmed that respiration, photosynthesis, calcification and surface expansion rate responded to the combined effect of temperature and light. Under each light intensity, mean calcification rate was linearly correlated with mean photosynthetic activity. Geochemical measurements were also influenced by temperature and, to a lesser degree, by light. All geochemical proxies measured on 6 nubbins showed a wide scattering of values, regardless of the environmental condition. Compared to the other proxies, delta O-18 exhibited a different behavior. It was the only proxy exhibiting temperature tracer behavior. However, while mean values of Sr/Ca, Mg/Ca and delta C-13 were well correlated, the correlation between the later and mean delta O-18 differed with light level. This suggests that both skeleton deposition and temperature oxygen fractionation differs according to light intensity. Overall, the effect of light on geochemical values seems to compromise the use of proxy calibrations solely based on temperature influence. Under high light conditions, the great amplitude shown by individual net photosynthesis is directly proportional to the highly variable zooxanthellae density. As light is affecting all of the proxies, we thus assume that the strong geochemical variability observed could be explained by various algae densities, each nubbin responding according to its zooxanthellae amount. Accordingly, we suggest that each symbiosome (the assemblage of few corallites with their symbionts) presents its own vital effect influence over time. Therefore, at a bulk sample scale, light could be considered as one of the major causes of what is commonly referred to as the `vital effect'. The meaning of delta O-18 calibration versus temperature established from distinct colonies differs from calibration calculated from samples collected following the growth axis of a single coral head. Finally, in order to quantitatively reconstruct climatic condition, we suggest a new paradigm based on the statistical treatment of the combination of time-series information from several proxies, all measured on the same sample from a continuous symbiosome.

Here, we test the hypothesis that increased temperature leads to bleaching in dinoflagellate-bearing foraminifera similar to corals and that increased nutrients through runoff can exaggerate stress on the holobiont. In an experiment manipulating temperatures alone, we have shown that mortality of Marginopora vertebralis increased with temperatures. Most individuals died after 7 days at 34A degrees C, similar to 5A degrees C above current summer maxima. Survival at 37 days was > 98\% at 28A degrees C. After 7 days of exposure to 31 or 32A degrees C, photosynthesis of the endosymbionts was compromised, as indicated by several photophysiological parameters (effective quantum yield and apparent photosynthetic rate). In a flow-though experiment manipulating both temperature (three levels, 26, 29 and 31A degrees C) and nitrate concentrations (3 levels, similar to 0.5, 1.0 and 1.4 mu mol l(-1) NO3 (-)), elevated temperature had a significant negative effect on most parameters measured. At 31A degrees C, most photopigments (measured by UPLC) in the foraminifera were significantly reduced. The only pigment that increased was the photoprotective diatoxanthin. Several other parameters measured (maximum and effective quantum yield, O-2 production in light, organic carbon contents) also significantly decreased with temperature. Optode-based respirometry demonstrated that the presence of symbionts at elevated temperatures represents a net carbon loss for the host. Growth rates of M. vertebralis and mortality at the end of the experiment were significantly affected by both temperature increase and nitrate addition. We conclude that these foraminifera bleach in a similar fashion to corals and that global sea surface temperature change and nitrate increases are stressors for these protists.

In recent decades both anomalously warm and cold seawater temperatures have resulted in mass coral bleaching events. Whilst corals' response to elevated temperature has justifiably attracted substantial research interest, coral physiology under cold water stress is relatively unfamiliar. The response to below typical winter water temperature was tested for two common reef building species from the Gulf of Aqaba in an ex situ experiment. Stylophora pistillata and Acropora eurystoma were exposed to 1 or 3 degrees C below average winter temperature and a suite of physiological parameters were assessed. At 3 degrees C below winter minima (ca. 18.6 degrees C), both species had significant declines in photosynthetic indices (maximum quantum yield, electron transport rate, saturation irradiance, and photochemical efficiency) and chlorophyll concentration compared to corals at ambient winter temperatures. It was previously unknown that corals at this site live close to their cold-water bleaching threshold and may be vulnerable as climate variability increases in magnitude. In order to determine if a cold winter reduces the known heat resistance of this population, the corals were subsequently exposed to an acute warm period at 30 degrees C the following summer. Exposed to above typical summer temperatures, both species showed fewer physiological deviations compared to the cold-water stress. Therefore, the cold winter experience did not increase corals' susceptibility to above ambient summer temperatures. This study provides further support for the selection of heat tolerant genotypes colonising the Red Sea basin and thereby support the mechanism behind the Reef Refuge Hypothesis.",PEERJ INC,"341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND",English,"Bellworthy, J (Corresponding Author), Bar Ilan Univ, Goodman Fac Life Sci, Ramat Gan, Israel.

In this study the effects of high temperature and light on zooxanthellae living in the Caribbean reef corals Montastrea annularis, M. cavernosa, Agaricia agaricites, and A. lamarcki were studied. Pieces of coral colonies were incubated at ambient seawater temperature (26 degrees + 1 degrees), and at 30 degrees, 32 degrees, and 34 degrees C. Symbiotic algae from M. annularis, a species of coral from the forereef that commonly bleaches, showed the following sequence of events when exposed to natural light at 32 degrees C: loss of photosynthetic potential measured as fluorescence yield, corresponding reduction of both oxygen production per zooxanthella and P:R (photosynthesis:respiration) ratio, and subsequent reduction in density of algae in relation to surface area of the coral. These parameters were not signifcantly reduced and no deaths occurred for M. annularis or any other coral species maintained at 26 degrees or 30 degrees C. However, the sequence of events was condensed to less than 24 h when M. annularis was subjected to 34 degrees C seawater, except that there was little if any reduction in algal density before tissue-sloughing and death occurred between 10 and 24 h. Loss of significant amounts of chlorophyll a per alga was not evident for any corals except those maintained at 34 degrees C longer than 10 h. In contrast, symbiotic algae in M. cavernosa, a species that rarely bleaches in nature, showed only slight reductions in photosynthesis and fluorescence yield, and no significant loss of algal cells or chlorophyll a, when maintained in seawater at 32 degrees C for 2 days. Thus zooxanthellae in M. cavernosa appeared to be less affected by sublethal high-temperature stress. Similar contrasting patterns of bleaching were seen in zooxanthellae from the plating coral Agaricia lamarcki, which often bleaches during the late summer and fall, compared with zooxanthellae from A. agaricites, a coral which bleaches less frequently. In addition, M. annularis exposed to sublethal high temperatures and ambient light bleached faster than those kept in dimmer light, supporting past field observations suggesting that light energy is an important component of bleaching in nature. When M. annularis was exposed to different wavelengths of natural light at 32 degrees C, the fluorescence yield declined more quickly in the presence of higher energy UV-A and blue light than with other photosynthetically active radiation. Natural levels of UV-B had little effect in this study. These data suggest that the patterns of bleaching seen in nature may be at least partially explained by different tolerances of the symbiotic algae in the corals, and that light plays a significant role in bleaching.",MARINE BIOL LAB,"BIOLOGICAL BULL MBL STREET, WOODS HOLE, MA 02543",English,"Fitt, WK (Corresponding Author), UNIV GEORGIA,INST ECOL,ATHENS,GA 30602, USA.",10.2307/1542147,0006-3185,NA,ULTRAVIOLET-RADIATION; MONTASTREA-ANNULARIS; ELEVATED-TEMPERATURE; MORTALITY; EVENT; SALINITY; HAWAIIAN; STRESS; PANAMA; LIGHT,Life Sciences \& Biomedicine - Other Topics; Marine \& Freshwater Biology,Biology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology,NA,NA,"Warner, Mark E/J-6241-2013 ","Warner, Mark/0000-0003-1015-9413",NA,NA,35,214,0,74,Biol.

It has been hypothesized that mortality could have been due to a nutrient (food) shortage following the stratification of the water column. However, the symbiotic gorgonian Eunicella singularis has also presented a locally exceptional mortality, despite its autotrophic capacities through the photosynthesis of its dinoflagellate symbionts. Thus, this study has experimentally investigated the response of E. singularis to a thermal stress (temperature increase from 18 to 26 degrees C), with colonies maintained more than 2 months under four nutritional diets: autotrophy only (AO), autotrophy and inorganic nitrogen addition (AN), autotrophy and heterotrophy (AH), heterotrophy only (HO). At 18 degrees C, and contrary to many other anthozoans, supplementation of autotrophy with either inorganic nitrogen or food (heterotrophy) had no effect on the rates of respiration, photosynthesis, as well as in the chlorophyll, lipid and protein content. In the dark, heterotrophy maintained the gorgonian's metabolism, except a bleaching (loss of pigments), which did not affect the rates of photosynthesis. At 24 degrees C, rates of respiration, and photosynthesis significantly decreased in all treatments. At 26 degrees C, in addition to a decrease in the lipid content of all treatments, a bleaching was observed after 1 week in the AO treatment, while the AH and AN treatments resisted three weeks before bleaching. These last results suggest that, temperatures above 24 degrees C impair the energetic reserves of this species and might explain the mortality events in the Mediterranean.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",English,"Ezzat, L (Corresponding Author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil \& Environm Engn ENAC, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.

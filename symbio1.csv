Mass bleaching events have been linked to a thermal lesion in the photosynthesis of Symbiodinium, either at photosystem II or in the dark reactions of photosynthesis. Examination of two of the proposed lesion points, the carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM) and form II Rubisco, indicate that, over the temperature range examined, the CCM is not disrupted in Symbiodinium isolated from giant clams, however it was not possible to determine if Rubisco is the point of thermal lesion resulting in bleaching.

Deviation outside this range causes physiological impairment of reef-building corals, potentially leading to coral colony death. In January and February 2010, two closely spaced cold fronts, possibly driven by an unusually extreme Arctic Oscillation, caused sudden and severe seawater temperature declines in the Florida Keys. Inshore coral reefs {[}e. g., Admiral Reef (ADM)] experienced lower sustained temperatures (i.e., < 12 degrees C) than those further offshore {[}e. g., Little Grecian Reef (LG), minimum temperature = 17.2 degrees C]. During February and March 2010, we surveyed ADM and observed a mass die-off of reef-building corals, whereas 12 km away LG did not exhibit coral mortality. We subsequently measured the physiological effects of low-temperature stress on three common reef-building corals (i.e., Montastraea faveolata, Porites astreoides, and Siderastrea siderea) over a range of temperatures that replicated the inshore cold-water anomaly (i.e., from 20 to 16 to 12 degrees C and back to 20 degrees C). Throughout the temperature modulations, coral respiration as well as endosymbiont gross photosynthesis and maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II were measured. In addition, Symbiodinium genotypic identity, cell densities, and chlorophyll a content were determined at the beginning and conclusion of the experiment. All corals were significantly affected at 12 degrees C, but species-specific physiological responses were found indicating different coral and/or Symbiodinium cold tolerances. Montastraea faveolata and P. astreoides appeared to be most negatively impacted because, upon return to 20 degrees C, significant reductions in gross photosynthesis and dark respiration persisted. Siderastrea siderea, however, readily recovered to pre-treatment rates of dark respiration and gross photosynthesis. Visual surveys of inshore reefs corroborated these results, with S. siderea being minimally affected by the cold-water anomaly, whereas M. faveolata and P. astreoides exhibited nearly 100\% mortality. This study highlights the importance of understanding the physiological attributes of genotypically distinct coral-Symbiodinium symbioses that contribute to tolerance, recovery, and consequences to an environmental perturbation. These data also document effects of a rarely studied environmental stressor, possibly initiated by remote global climate events, on coral-Symbiodinium symbioses and coral reef communities.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",English,"Kemp, DW (Corresponding Author), Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.

The genus Symbiodinium exhibits high genetic diversity with physiological variation within and among species, leading to a range of thermal tolerance. Although these variations have been examined in individual species, comprehensive comparative experimental data across several species are still rare. Therefore, in the present study, the photophysiological and thermal response patterns of six genetically characterized Symbiodinium genotypes were comparatively investigated. The six Symbiodinium genotypes were isolated from four different host species from the following biogeographic locations: Hawaii (Central Pacific), Panama (Caribbean), Florida (Caribbean), and Palau (West Pacific). Photosynthesis-irradiance curve and growth measurements at temperatures ranging from 20 to 33 A degrees C were carried out. All physiological data clearly indicate significant differences in the response patterns of the six Symbiodinium genotypes. While some types photosynthesized, respired, and grew at 33 A degrees C, others showed a partial or complete inhibition.

In this work, we first question whether there is an energetic coupling between photosynthesis and respiration in Symbiodiniaceae (Symbiodinium,DurusdiniumandEffrenium), and second, how different levels of energetic coupling will affect their adaptive responses to global warming. Coupling between photosynthesis and respiration was established by determining the variation of metabolic rates during thermal response curves, and how inhibition of respiration affects photosynthesis. Adaptive (irreversible) responses were studied by exposing twoSymbiodiniumspecies with different levels of photosynthesis-respiration interaction to high temperature conditions (32 degrees C) for 1 yr. We found that some Symbiodiniaceae have a high level of energetic coupling; that is, photosynthesis and respiration have the same temperature dependency, and photosynthesis is negatively affected when respiration is inhibited. Conversely, photosynthesis and respiration are not coupled in other species. In any case, prolonged exposure to high temperature caused adjustments in both photosynthesis and respiration, but these changes were fully reversible. We conclude that energetic coupling between photosynthesis and respiration exhibits wide variation amongst Symbiodiniaceae and does not determine the occurrence of adaptive responses in Symbiodiniaceae to temperature increase.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Pierangelini, M; Cardol, P (Corresponding Author), Univ Liege, InBioS Phytosyst, Genet \& Physiol Microalgues, Inst Bot, B22, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.

This symbiosis is disrupted by thermally induced coral bleaching, a stress response in which the coral host expels its algal symbionts as they become physiologically impaired. The disruption of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) supply or the thermal inactivation of Rubisco have been proposed as sites of initial thermal damage that leads to the bleaching response. Symbiodinium possesses a highly unusual Form II ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), which exhibits a lower CO2:O-2 specificity and may be more thermally unstable than the Form I Rubiscos of other algae and land plants. Components of the CO2 concentrating mechanism (CCM), which supplies inorganic carbon for photosynthesis, may also be temperature sensitive. Here, we examine the ability of four cultured Symbiodinium strains to acquire and fix DIC across a temperature gradient. Surprisingly, the half-saturation constant of photosynthesis with respect to DIC concentration (K (P)), an index of CCM function, declined with increasing temperature in three of the four strains, indicating a greater potential for photosynthetic carbon acquisition at elevated temperatures. In the fourth strain, there was no effect of temperature on K (P). Finding no evidence for thermal inhibition of the CCM, we conclude that CCM components are not likely to be the primary sites of thermal damage. Reduced photosynthetic quantum yields, a hallmark of thermal bleaching, were observed at low DIC concentrations, leaving open the possibility that reduced inorganic carbon availability is involved in bleaching.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"Hopkinson, BM (Corresponding Author), Univ Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA.

In whole corals, O-2 production at 26 degrees C was significantly limited at C-i concentrations below ambient seawater (similar to 2.2 mM). Further additions of C-i up to similar to 10 mM caused no further stimulation of oxygenic photosynthesis. Following exposure to 30 degrees C (2 d), net oxygen production decreased significantly in whole corals, as a result of reduced production of photosynthetically derived oxygen rather than increased host consumption. Whole corals maintained a rate of oxygen evolution around eight times lower than cultured Symbiodinium sp. at inorganic carbon concentrations < 2 mM, but cultures displayed greater levels of photoinhibition following heat treatment (30 degrees C, 2 d). Whole corals and cultured zooxanthellae differed considerably in their responses to C-i concentration and moderate heat stress, demonstrating that cultured Symbiodinium make an incongruous model for those in hospite.

In tightly linked mutualisms, evolutionary rescue may occur through evolution of the host and/or endosymbionts. Many obligate mutualisms are composed of relatively small, fast-growing symbionts with greater potential to evolve on ecologically relevant time scales than their relatively large, slower growing hosts. Numerous jellyfish species harbor closely related endosymbiont taxa to other cnidarian species such as coral, and are commonly used as a model system for investigating cnidarian mutualisms. We examined the potential for adaptation of the upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea xamachana to increased temperature via evolution of its microalgal endosymbiont, Symbiodinium microadriaticum. We quantified trait variation among five algal genotypes in response to three temperatures (26 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 32 degrees C) and fitness of hosts infected with each genotype. All genotypes showed positive growth rates at each temperature, but rates of respiration and photosynthesis decreased with increased temperature. Responses varied among genotypes but were unrelated to genetic similarity. The effect of temperature on asexual reproduction and the timing of development in the host also depended on the genotype of the symbiont. Natural selection could favor different algal genotypes at different temperatures, affecting host fitness. This eco-evolutionary interaction may be a critical component of understanding species resilience in increasingly stressful environments.",NATURE PORTFOLIO,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",English,"ter Horst, CP (Corresponding Author), Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA.

Conversely, the octocoral Briareum asbestinum exhibits both encrusting and upright branching morphologies at the same shallow water habitat, enabling studying physiological differences uncoupled from habitat variation due to depth or reef location. We investigated the mutualism between endosymbiotic dinoflagellate algae, Breviolum spp. (previously clade B Symbiodinium), and these B. asbestinum morphologies at ambient and elevated temperatures. Based on msh1 gene sequences, the host morphologies were genetically similar although they differed in protein content, polyp expansion behavior, and associated Breviolum (B19 for encrusting and B21 for branching B. asbestinum). Due to colony orientation, polyps in encrusting B. asbestinum experienced irradiance levels nearly three times higher than polyps in the branching morph, which probably contributed to the lower photochemical and light absorption efficiencies of the Breviolum in encrusting fragments. The light-limited portion of photosynthesis-irradiance curves and the intracellular chlorophyll concentrations, however, indicated that Breviolum in both morphologies were acclimated to similar internal irradiances. Encrusting B. asbestinum exhibited higher Breviolum density, areal chlorophyll a, and greater photosynthetic rates cm(-2) compared to branching B. asbestinum. Notably, elevated temperature did not cause bleaching in either morphology, as Breviolum and chlorophyll densities did not differ significantly from ambient temperature, although the two morphologies adjusted some of the measured parameters, indicating coping with the stressor.

We used a phylogenetically controlled design to investigate the role of vertical symbiont transmission, an evolutionary mechanism in which symbionts are inherited directly from parents, predicted to enhance cooperation and holobiont fitness. Six species of coral, three vertical transmitters and their closest horizontally transmitting relatives, which exhibit environmental acquisition of symbionts, were fragmented and subjected to a 2-week thermal stress experiment. Symbiont cell density, photosynthetic function and translocation of photosynthetically fixed carbon between symbionts and hosts were quantified to assess changes in physiological performance and cooperation. All species exhibited similar decreases in symbiont cell density and net photosynthesis in response to elevated temperature, consistent with the onset of bleaching. Yet baseline cooperation, or translocation of photosynthate, in ambient conditions and the reduction in cooperation in response to elevated temperature differed among species. Although Porites lobata and Galaxea acrhelia did exhibit the highest levels of baseline cooperation, we did not observe universally higher levels of cooperation in vertically transmitting species. Post hoc sequencing of the Symbiodinium ITS-2 locus was used to investigate the potential role of differences in symbiont community composition. Interestingly, reductions in cooperation at the onset of bleaching tended to be associated with increased symbiont community diversity among coral species. The theoretical benefits of evolving vertical transmission are based on the underlying assumption that the host-symbiont relationship becomes genetically uniform, thereby reducing competition among symbionts. Taken together, our results suggest that it may not be vertical transmission per se that influences host-symbiont cooperation, but genetic uniformity of the symbiont community, although additional work is needed to test this hypothesis.",PEERJ INC,"341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND",English,"Kenkel, CD (Corresponding Author), Univ Southern Calif, Dept Biol Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.

To acquire carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, many marine autotrophs rely on the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) to catalyze the conversion of bicarbonate ions, (HCO3-) to CO2. In zoanthids and other cnidarians with Symbiodinium spp. endosymbionts, CA is essential for transporting CO2 to symbionts for photosynthesis. Temperature and ambient DIC affect CA activity, therefore, increased sea water temperatures and ocean acidification (OA) will alter CO2 transport in symbiotic cnidarians. However, these effects are likely to be species specific for both host and symbiont, as different cnidarians and Symbiodinium spp. vary in their mechanisms of DIC transport and utilization of CA. In this study, host and symbiont CA activity in the zoanthids Palythoa sp. and Zoanthus sp. varied with thermal stress and low pH. Increased temperature inhibited algal, but not host CA activity in Zoanthus sp. polyps with A4 Symbiodinium, while temperature had no effect on CA activity in Palythoa sp. with Cl Symbiodinium. High pCO(2)/low pH altered algal CA activity in both zoanthid species, but host CA activity changed in Zoanthus sp. polyps only. This study shows that thermal stress and OA induce species-specific changes in CA activity, and thus DIC transport in symbiotic zoanthids. These observations suggest that CA activity in symbiotic cnidarians will be altered by climate conditions predicted for the future, and for some cnidarians, changes in CA activity may inhibit photosynthesis.

To better understand the response of the circadian clock in corals to temperature elevation, photosynthesis as an output process of the circadian clock was studied both in Stylophora pistillata corals and in cultured Symbiodinium algae. The time period of photosynthesis was not affected by temperature elevation in the cultured algae or in the corals harbouring Symbiodinium.

However, different corals exhibit differential bleaching susceptibilities, perhaps resulting from dissimilar abilities to deal with oxidative stress. We therefore tested whether thermal sensitivity in Symbiodinium is correlated with the capacity to deal with oxidative stress, by comparing the effects of increased temperature and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration on the photosynthetic performance of four cultured Symbiodinium ITS2 types (A1, B2, E, and F1) and two freshly isolated Symbiodinium ITS2 types (a temperate A-type and B1). Generally, the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (F (v)/F (m)) declined in Symbiodinium with both increasing thermal and oxidative stress. However, not all types followed this pattern. Cultured Symbiodinium A1 showed a strong negative response to elevated temperature but little response to the addition of H2O2, while cultured F1 showed an increase in F (v)/F (m) at elevated temperature but a decline in this parameter to almost zero at high H2O2 concentrations. Furthermore, both freshly isolated Symbiodinium types appeared to be relatively stress tolerant, with the temperate A-type showing an especially high resistance to both stressors. In conclusion, a range of Symbiodinium types were shown to differ in their susceptibilities to both thermal and oxidative stress, though in contrast to our original hypothesis, sensitivity to oxidative stress did not necessarily predict thermal sensitivity (or vice versa).",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",English,"Davy, SK (Corresponding Author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.

Because an important molecular trigger to bleaching appears related to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), it is critical to understand the function of the antioxidant network of Symbiodinium species. In this study we investigated the response of two Symbiodinium species, from contrasting environments, to a chemically induced oxidative stress. ROS produced during this oxidative burst reduced photosynthesis by 30 to 50\% and significantly decreased the activity of superoxide dismutase. Lipid peroxidation levels and carotenoid concentrations, especially diatoxanthin, confirm that these molecules act as antioxidants and contribute to the stabilization of membrane lipids. The comparative analysis between the two Symbiodinium species allowed us to highlight that Symbiodinium sp. clade A temperate was more tolerant to oxidative stress than the tropical S. kawagutii clade F.

The two types responded very differently to a period of elevated temperature (32 degrees C): type A1 increased light-driven O-2 consumption but not the amount of H2O2 produced; in contrast, type B1 increased the amount of H2O2 produced without an increase in light-driven O-2 consumption. Therefore, our results are consistent with previous suggestions that the thermal tolerance of Symbiodinium is related to adaptive constraints associated with photosynthesis and that sensitive phylotypes are more prone to H2O2 production. Understanding these adaptive differences in the genus Symbiodinium will be crucial if we are to interpret the response of symbiotic associations, including reef-building corals, to environmental change.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Suggett, DJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Essex, Coral Reef Res Unit, Dept Biol Sci, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.

Although the diversity of Symbiodinium provides a possible axis for niche diversification, increased functional range and resilience to physical stressors such as elevated temperature, how such diversity relates to the physiological balance between autotrophy and heterotrophy of the host animal remains unknown. Here, we experimentally show interspecific and intraspecific variability of photosynthetic carbon fixation and subsequent translocation by Symbiodinium to the model cnidarian host Aiptasia pallida. By using a clonal anemone line harboring different species of Symbiodinium, we determined that symbiont identity influences trophic plasticity through its density, capacity to fix carbon, quantity of translocated carbon and ultimately the host's capacity to ingest and digest prey. Symbiont carbon translocation and host prey ingestion were positively correlated across symbiont combinations that consisted of different isoclonal lines of Symbiodinium minutum, while a combination with type D4-5 Symbiodinium displayed lower carbon translocation, and prey capture and digestion more similar to Aiptasia lacking symbionts. The absence of a shift toward greater heterotrophy when carbon translocation is low suggests that the metabolic demand of feeding and digestion may overwhelm nutritional stores when photosynthesis is reduced, and amends the possible role of animal feeding in resistance to or recovery from the effects of climate change in more obligate symbioses such as reef-building corals.",COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",English,"Leal, MC (Corresponding Author), Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.

Heterogeneity between coral species and symbiont clades was identified in the thermal sensitivity of photosynthesis in the symbionts of the scleractinian corals Stylophora pistillata and Pocillopora damicornis, as well as among Symbiodinium cultures of clades A, B, and C. The in hospite symbionts of S. pistillata and the cultured clade C Symbiodinium both exhibited similar patterns in that their primary site of thermal inhibition occurred downstream of ferredoxin at 32 degrees C. In contrast, the primary site of thermal inhibition occurred upstream of ferredoxin in clades A and B at 32 degrees C, while at 34 degrees C, all samples showed combined up- and downstream inhibition. Although clade C is common to both P. damicornis and S. pistillata, the manner of thermal inhibition was not consistent when observed in hospite.

Whilst the genetic diversity of Symbiodinium has attracted particular interest because of its contribution to the sensitivity of corals to environmental changes and bleaching (i.e. disruption of coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis), very little is known about the in hospite metabolic capabilities of different Symbiodinium types. Using a combination of stable isotopic labelling and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS), we investigated the ability of the intact symbiosis between the reef-building coral Isopora palifera, and SymbiodiniumC or D types, to assimilate dissolved inorganic carbon (via photosynthesis) and nitrogen (as ammonium). Our results indicate that Symbiodinium types from two clades naturally associated with I.palifera possess different metabolic capabilities. The SymbiodiniumC type fixed and passed significantly more carbon and nitrogen to its coral host than the D type. This study provides further insights into the metabolic plasticity among different Symbiodinium types in hospite and strengthens the evidence that the more temperature-tolerant SymbiodiniumD type may be less metabolically beneficial for its coral host under non-stressful conditions.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Pernice, M (Corresponding Author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil \& Environm Engn ENAC, Lab Biol Geochem, Lausanne, Switzerland.

The coral symbiosis is highly susceptible to elevated temperatures, resulting in coral bleaching, where the algal symbiont is released from host cells. This experiment aimed to determine the transcriptional changes in cultured Symbiodinium, to better understand the response of cellular mechanisms under future temperature conditions. Cultures were exposed to elevated temperatures (average 31 degrees C) or control conditions (24.5 degrees C) for a period of 28 days. Whole transcriptome sequencing of Symbiodinium cells on days 4, 19, and 28 were used to identify differentially expressed genes under thermal stress. A large number of genes representing 37.01\% of the transcriptome (similar to 23,654 unique genes, FDR < 0.05) with differential expression were detected at no less than one of the time points. Consistent with previous studies of Symbiodinium gene expression, fold changes across the transcriptome were low, with 92.49\% differentially expressed genes at <= 2-fold change. The transcriptional response included differential expression of genes encoding stress response components such as the antioxidant network and molecular chaperones, cellular components such as core photosynthesis machinery, integral light-harvesting protein complexes and enzymes such as fatty acid desaturases. Differential expression of genes encoding glyoxylate cycle enzymes were also found, representing the first report of this in Symbiodinium. As photosynthate transfer from Symbiodinium to coral hosts provides up to 90\% of a coral's daily energy requirements, the implications of altered metabolic processes from exposure to thermal stress found in this study on coral-Symbiodinium associations are unknown and should be considered when assessing the stability of the symbiotic relationship under future climate conditions.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",English,"Gierz, SL (Corresponding Author), James Cook Univ, Coll Publ Hlth Med \& Vet Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia.

We report procedures for the extraction of Rubisco from Symbiodinium cells and for stable storage. We describe a continuous assay for Rubisco activity in these crude cell extracts using the Mn2+ chemiluminescence of Rubisco oxygenase. Chemiluminescence time courses exhibited initial transients resembling bacterial Form II Rubisco, followed by several minutes of linearly decreasing activity. The initial activity was determined from extrapolation of this linear section of the time course. The activity of fast-frozen cell extracts was stable at -80 degrees C and, after thawing and storage on ice, remained stable for up to 1 h before declining non-linearly.

However, future reefs are increasingly likely to face combined environmental stressors, further complicating our understanding of how S. trenchii will possibly acclimatize to future climate scenarios. Over a 33-day period, we characterized the individual and combined affects of high temperature (26.5 vs. 31.5 degrees C), pCO(2) (400 vs. 760 mu atm), and elevated nutrients (0.4 and 0.2 vs. 3.5 and 0.3 mu mol of NO3/NO2 and PO43-, respectively) on S. trenchii within the host coral species Turbinaria reniformis. Global analysis across all treatments found temperature to be the largest driver of physiological change. However, exposure to elevated temperature led to changes in symbiont physiology that differed across pCO(2) concentrations. Net photosynthesis and cellular chlorophyll a increased with temperature under ambient pCO(2), whereas temperature-related differences in cellular volume and its affect on pigment packaging were more pronounced under elevated pCO(2). Furthermore, increased nutrients mitigated the physiological response to high temperature under both ambient and elevated pCO(2) conditions and represented a significant interaction between all three physical parameters. Individual responses to temperature and pCO(2) were also observed as cellular density declined with elevated temperature and calcification along with respiration rates declined with increased pCO(2). Symbiodinium trenchii remained the dominant symbiont population within the host across all treatment combinations. Our results reveal distinct physiological changes in response to high temperature within the S. trenchii/T. reniformis symbioses that are dependent on pCO(2) and nutrient concentration, and represent important interactive effects to consider as we consider how corals will respond under future climate change scenarios.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",English,"Hoadley, KD (Corresponding Author), Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci \& Policy, Lewes, DE 19958 USA.

Significantly higher cellular concentrations of superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide are observed when cultures of Symbiodinium bermudense are exposed to elevated temperatures with and without exposure to UV radiation. This increase in oxidative stress is accompanied by a reduction in the quantum yield of fluorescence for photosystem 2 and protein-specific activities of the carboxylating enzyme, Rubisco. An increase in antioxidant enzyme activities is unable to protect these cells from oxidative stress during exposure to UV radiation and elevated temperatures (31 degrees C). The addition of exogenous scavengers of active oxygen, however, improves photosynthetic performance, but not to pre-exposure rates in zooxanthellae exposed to both elevated temperature and UV radiation, confirming a role for oxidative stress in the inhibition of photosynthesis by UV radiation and elevated temperatures.

This gradient included `optimal', intermediate and marginal sites, where conditions were close to the survival threshold limit for corals. Coral communities changed across this gradient from diverse, mixed growth form assemblages to specialised, massive growth form dominated communities. The massive coral Goniastrea aspera was the only species identified at the most marginal and optimal sites. Branching species Acropora formosa and Porites cylindrica were only identified at optimal sites. The in hospite Symbiodinium community also changed across the environmental gradient from members of the Symbiodinium clade C on optimal reefs (in branching and massive species) to clade D on marginal reefs ( in massive species). Substantial variability in respiration and photosynthesis was observed in massive coral species under different environmental conditions, which suggests that all corals cannot be considered equal across environments. Studying present-day marginal environments is crucial to further understanding of future reef bio-diversity, functioning and accretion, and from work presented here, it is likely that as future climate change extends marginal reef range, branching coral diversity may decrease relative to massive, more resilient corals.

However, little has been documented on its effects on the behavior and recruitment of coral larvae, which sustains coral reef ecosystems. Here, we analyzed physiological changes in larvae of the scleractinian coral Pocillopora damicornis and examined the photophysiological performance of the symbiont algae, following exposure to incident levels of UVR and subsequently observed the development of coral larvae. The endosymbiotic algae exhibited a high sensitivity to UV-B (295-320nm) during a 6h exposure, showing lowered photosynthetic performance per larva and per algal cell, whereas the presence of UV-A (320-395nm) significantly stimulated photosynthesis. UVR decreased chlorophyll a concentration only at higher surface temperature or at the higher doses or intensities of UVR. Correlations between UV-absorbing compound (UVAC) contents or UVR sensitivity and temperature were identified, implying that UVACs might act as a screen or antioxidants in Pocillopora damicornis larvae.

X.WOS.000225791300001,article,"Smith, DJ and Suggett, DJ and Baker, NR",Is photoinhibition of zooxanthellae photosynthesis the primary cause of thermal bleaching in corals?,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,2005,11,1,11-Jan,NA,NA,"The bleaching of corals in response to increases in temperature has resulted in significant coral reef degradation in many tropical marine ecosystems. This bleaching has frequently been attributed to photoinhibition of photosynthetic electron transport and the consequent photodamage to photosystem II (PSII) and the production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the zooxanthellae (Symbiodinium spp.). However, these events may be because of perturbations of other processes occurring within the zooxanthellae or the host cells, and consequently constitute only secondary responses to temperature increase. The processes involved with the onset of photoinhibition of electron transport, photodamage to PSII and pigment bleaching in coral zooxanthellae are reviewed. Consideration is given to how increases in temperature might lead to perturbations of metabolic processes in the zooxanthellae and/or their host cells, which could trigger events leading to bleaching. It is concluded that production of ROS by the thylakoid photosynthetic apparatus in the zooxanthellae plays a major role in the onset of bleaching resulting from photoinhibition of photosynthesis, although it is not clear which particular ROS are involved. It is suggested that hydrogen peroxide generated in the zooxanthellae may have a signalling role in triggering the mechanisms that result in expulsion of zooxanthellae from corals.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Baker, NR (Corresponding Author), Univ Essex, Coral Reef Res Unit, Dept Biol Sci, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.

One of these species, Symbiodinium muscatinei LaJeunesse et Trench, has a broad latitudinal distribution, occurring in intertidal anemones from Washington state to Southern California. To investigate whether high thermal tolerance contributes to the ability of S. muscatinei to inhabit anemones from northern and southern regions, the upper thermal tolerance limit for photosynthesis of symbionts in northern (48 degrees 24' N) populations of A. elegantissima was determined by subjecting anemones to a gradual increase in temperature from 12 degrees C to 30 degrees C over a 10-week period. Light-saturated photosynthetic rates of isolated zooxanthellae were the same over the range of 12 degrees C-24 degrees C and declined significantly at 26 degrees C, which is 14 degrees C and 5 degrees C above average summertime seawater temperatures in northern Puget Sound and Southern California, respectively. At 28 degrees C, zooxanthellae isolated from the anemones, and those expelled by their hosts, exhibited extremely low rates of photosynthesis and highly reduced chl content. The photosynthetic rates and chl content of expelled zooxanthellae were lower than those of retained zooxanthellae. The high thermal tolerance of S. muscatinei isolated from northern populations of anemones supports the broad latitudinal distribution of this symbiont, allowing it to coexist with S. californium (\#383, Banaszak et al. 1993) in southern populations of anemones.",BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",English,"Muller-Parker, G (Corresponding Author), Western Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA.

However, static temperature manipulations may underestimate the thermal complexity of the reefs in which many corals live. For instance, corals of Houbihu, Taiwan, experience changes in temperature of up to 10 degrees C over the course of a day during spring-tide upwelling events. To better understand the phenotypic plasticity of these corals, a laboratory-based experiment was conducted whereby specimens of Seriatopora hystrix from an upwelling reef (Houbihu) and conspecifics from a non-upwelling reef (Houwan) were exposed to both a stable seawater temperature (26 degrees C) regime and a regime characterized by a 6 degrees C fluctuation (23-29 degrees C) over a 12. h period for 7. days. A suite of physiological and molecular parameters was measured in samples of both treatments, as well as in experimental controls, to determine site of origin (SO) and temperature treatment (TT) responses. Only chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration and growth demonstrated the hypothesized trend of higher levels when exposed to a TT that mimicked SO conditions. In contrast, chl a, maximum dark-adapted quantum yield of photosystem II (F-v/F-m), and Symbiodinium ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rbcL), photosystem I (psI, subunit III) and phosphoglycolate phosphatase (pgpase) mRNA expression demonstrated significant TT effects. Specifically, levels of these response variables were higher in samples exposed to a variable temperature regime, suggesting that S. hystrix may acclimate to fluctuating temperatures by increasing its capacity for photosynthesis.",COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",English,"Mayfield, AB (Corresponding Author), Natl Museum Marine Biol \& Aquarium, Checheng, Pingtung, Taiwan.

Most studies to date have focused on the destabilization of coral-dinoflagellate symbioses due to warming oceans, or declining calcification due to ocean acidification. In our study, pH and temperature conditions consistent with the end-of-century scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) caused major changes in photosynthesis and respiration, in addition to decreased calcification rates in the coral Acropora millepora. Population density of symbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium) under high levels of ocean acidification and temperature (Representative Concentration Pathway, RCP8.5) decreased to half of that found under present day conditions, with photosynthetic and respiratory rates also being reduced by 40\%. These physiological changes were accompanied by evidence for gene regulation of calcium and bicarbonate transporters along with components of the organic matrix. Meta-transcriptomic RNA-Seq data analyses showed an overall down regulation of metabolic transcripts, and an increased abundance of transcripts involved in circadian clock control, controlling the damage of oxidative stress, calcium signaling/homeostasis, cytoskeletal interactions, transcription regulation, DNA repair, Wnt signaling and apoptosis/immunity/toxins. We suggest that increased maintenance costs under ocean acidification and warming, and diversion of cellular ATP to pH homeostasis, oxidative stress response, UPR and DNA repair, along with metabolic suppression, may underpin why Acroporid species tend not to thrive under future environmental stress.

Symbiont cell diameter and volume were higher during January than September. Although zooxanthella-specific chlorophyll was independent of jellyfish size, both chlorophyll a and c were higher during January. Regardless of season, algal density and jellyfish size were inversely related. The diel mitotic index (MI) of zooxanthellae was phased, with a peak of 0.25\% occurring between 09:00 and 12:00 h. September photosynthetic rates were always higher than January rates and reflected the seasonal light and temperature regimes at the latitude of the Florida Keys (USA). Photosynthesis, when normalized to either zooxanthella density or protein, displayed an inverse relationship with jellyfish size. Medusan respiration rates also showed an inverse relationship with jellyfish size, with September metabolism being higher than that of January. The carbon budgets calculated for these medusae indicate that the carbon photosynthetically fixed by the zooxanthellae, and subsequently translocated to the host, is capable of satisfying about 169\% of the host's metabolic demand (CZAR) and is independent of both jellyfish size and season.

In this study, the effects of bleaching (induced by elevated light and temperature) on the condition of symbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium sp.) within the tissue of the hard coral Stylophora pistillata (Esper) were assessed using a suite of techniques. Bleaching of S. pistillata was accompanied by declines in the maximum potential quantum yield of photosynthesis (F-v/F-m, measured using pulse amplitude modulated {[}PAM] fluorometry), an increase in the number of Sytox-green-stained algae (indicating compromised algal membrane integrity and cell death), an increase in 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluroscein diacetate (H(2)DCFDA)stained algae (indicating increased oxidative stress), as well as ultrastructural changes (vacuolisation, losses of chlorophyll, and an increase in accumulation bodies). Algae expelled from S. pistillata exhibited a complete disorganisation of cellular contents; expelled cells contained only amorphous material. In situ samples taken during a natural mass coral bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef in February 2002 also revealed a high number of Sytox-labelled algae cells in symbio. Dinoflagellate degeneration during bleaching seems to be similar to the changes resulting from senescence-phase cell death in cultured algae.

We investigated how C. orientalis responded to past and future ocean conditions in a simulated community setting. The experiment lasted over an Austral summer under four carbon dioxide emission scenarios: a pre-industrial scenario (PI), a present-day scenario (PD; control), and two future scenarios of combined ocean acidification and ocean warming, i.e., B1 (intermediate) and A1FI (extreme). The four scenarios also simulated natural variability of carbon dioxide partial pressure and temperature in seawater. Responses of C. orientalis generally remained similar between the PI and PD treatments. C. orientalis under B1 displayed a dramatic increase in lateral tissue extension, but bleached and displayed reduced rates of respiration and photosynthesis. Some B1 sponge replicates died by the end of the experiment. Under A1FI, strong bleaching and subsequent mortality of all C. orientalis replicates occurred at an early stage of the experiment. Mortality arrested bioerosion by C. orientalis under B1 and A1FI. Overall, the absolute amount of calcium carbonate eroded by C. orientalis under B1 or A1FI was similar to that under PI or PD at the end of the experiment. Although bioerosion rates were raised by short-term experimental acidification in previous studies, our findings from the photosymbiotic C. orientalis imply that the effects of bioerosion on reef carbonate budgets may only be temporary if the bioeroders cannot survive long-term in the future oceans.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"Fang, JKH (Corresponding Author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Coral Reef Ecosyst Lab, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.

In this study, we explored the implications for juvenile scleractinians (<40-mm diameter) of growing on igneous versus carbonate rock on the shallow reefs (5-m depth) of St. John, US Virgin Islands. Surveys revealed that juvenile corals occurred at densities of 16 colonies m(-2) and were distributed on igneous and carbonate rocks in proportion to the abundance of these surfaces, suggesting that larvae do not discriminate between rock types at settlement. Repeated surveys demonstrated that all juvenile corals (i.e., pooled among taxa) grew 41\% slower on igneous versus carbonate rock between January and August, but not between August and January when the growth was statistically indistinguishable between rock types. Although the growth of the most common juvenile coral, Porites astreoides, was similar on both substrata, the photophysiology of this species was affected by the type of rock. The maximum relative electron transfer rate (rETR, a proxy for photosynthesis) of P. astreoides was down-regulated 30\% on igneous compared to carbonate rock. Phylogenetic analyses of the Symbiodinium community sequence profiles within P. astreoides revealed significant differences between substrata, with a greater diversity of co-occurring ITS-2 sequences in corals growing on carbonate compared to igneous rock. While substratum-dependent patterns in the characteristics of juvenile corals suggested there is selective value to the settlement choices made by larvae, these trends did not translate into differences in survival, at least over the time scale investigated. It remains uncertain what features of the rocks affected coral performance, but differences in the temperature of the rock may be an important feature during the warmest period of the year.

The relationship between coral physiology and its microbiome may reveal why some corals are more resilient to these global change conditions. Here, we conducted the first experiment to simultaneously investigate changes in the coral microbiome and coral physiology in response to the dual stress of elevated seawater temperature and ocean acidification expected by the end of this century. Two species of corals, Acropora millepora containing the thermally sensitive endosymbiont C21a and Turbinaria reniformis containing the thermally tolerant endosymbiont Symbiodinium trenchi, were exposed to control (26.5 degrees C and pCO(2) of 364 mu atm) and treatment (29.0 degrees C and pCO(2) of 750 mu atm) conditions for 24 days, after which we measured the microbial community composition. These microbial findings were interpreted within the context of previously published physiological measurements from the exact same corals in this study (calcification, organic carbon flux, ratio of photosynthesis to respiration, photosystem II maximal efficiency, total lipids, soluble animal protein, soluble animal carbohydrates, soluble algal protein, soluble algal carbohydrate, biomass, endosymbiotic algal density, and chlorophyll a). Overall, dually stressed A. millepora had reduced microbial diversity, experienced large changes in microbial community composition, and experienced dramatic physiological declines in calcification, photosystem II maximal efficiency, and algal carbohydrates. In contrast, the dually stressed coral T. reniformis experienced a stable and more diverse microbiome community with minimal physiological decline, coupled with very high total energy reserves and particulate organic carbon release rates. Thus, the microbiome changed and microbial diversity decreased in the physiologically sensitive coral with the thermally sensitive endosymbiotic algae but not in the physiologically tolerant coral with the thermally tolerant endosymbiont. Our results confirm recent findings that temperature-stress tolerant corals have a more stable microbiome, and demonstrate for the first time that this is also the case under the dual stresses of ocean warming and acidification. We propose that coral with a stable microbiome are also more physiologically resilient and thus more likely to persist in the future, and shape the coral species diversity of future reef ecosystems.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",English,"Grottoli, AG (Corresponding Author), Ohio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.

While most coral reef studies focus on the effects of thermal stress and ocean acidification, few studies acknowledge the threat of hypoxia. Hypoxia is traditionally defined as 6.3 kPa (2 mg L-1 O2), however, a universal hypoxia threshold is not useful given the vast range of responses among marine organisms. The range of metabolic responses and tolerances to hypoxia are unknown for Caribbean coral species and their algal symbionts. ObjectiveHere, we quantified the spectrum of acute hypoxia tolerances and the range of metabolic responses of six ecologically and structurally important Caribbean coral species (Acropora cervicornis, Siderastrea radians, Siderastrea siderea, Porites astreoides, Porites porites, and Orbicella faveolata) and their algal symbionts (Symbiodinium, Breviolum, and Durusdinium spp.). MethodsA total of 24 coral fragments (4 individuals per species) were exposed to 10 distinct oxygen concentrations ranging from normoxia (20.38 kPa) to severe hypoxia (3.3 kPa). We used intermittent flow respirometry to measure coral host respiration in the dark and algal symbiont photosynthesis in the light at each oxygen level. We determined a line of best fit for the metabolic rate vs. PO2 data and calculated the critical oxygen partial pressure (PO2 crit), a method that has not been tested on symbiotic species. ResultsCoral species and their algal symbionts measured here displayed a wide range of hypoxia tolerances. For the coral hosts, PO2 crit values differed roughly two-fold ranging from 5.74 kPa to 16.93 kPa, and for the algal symbionts, PO2 crit values differed roughly three-fold ranging from 3.9 kPa to 11.3 kPa. DiscussionThese results should be regarded as a first step to characterizing the metabolic response and acute tolerance of multiple coral hosts and algal symbionts to a wide range of oxygen concentrations. Given that some PO2 crit values were above the generally accepted hypoxia threshold, these results have implications for the community composition of reefs under a rapidly changing climate and can guide purposeful reef restoration.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",English,"Pontes, E (Corresponding Author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine Atmospher \& Earth Sci, Dept Marine Biol \& Ecol, Miami, FL 33136 USA.

Response variables detected the sequence of events associated with the onset of bleaching: reduction in the photosynthetic performance of symbionts as measured by maximum photochemical efficiency (F (v)/F (m)) and effective photochemical efficiency (Delta F/F (m)') of PSII, declines in net photosynthesis (P (net)) and photosynthetic efficiency (alpha, alpha), and finally, reduced chlorophyll a and symbiont concentrations. S. caliendrum was collected from Nanwan Bay, Taiwan, and subjected to combinations of temperature (27.7 vs. 30.5 A degrees C) and pCO(2) (45.1 vs. 85.1 Pa) for 14 days. High temperature reduced values of all dependent variables (i.e., bleaching occurred), but high pCO(2) did not affect Symbiodinium photophysiology or productivity, and did not cause bleaching. These results suggest that short-term exposure to 81.5 Pa pCO(2), alone and in combination with elevated temperature, does not cause or affect coral bleaching.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"Wall, CB (Corresponding Author), Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, 18111 Nordhoff St, Northridge, CA 91330 USA.

Many sea anemones, corals and jellies in the phylum Cnidaria form endosymbiotic relationships with Symbiodinium spp. (phylum Dinoflagellata) supply the hosts with fixed carbon from photosynthesis. Much work has focused on the generally negative effects of rising temperature and OA on calcification in Symbiodinium-coral symbioses, but has not directly measured symbiont photosynthesis in hospite or fixed carbon translocation from symbiont to host. Symbiodinium species or types vary in their environmental tolerance and photosynthetic capacity; therefore, primary production in symbiotic associations can vary with symbiont type. However, symbiont type has not been identified in a large portion of Symbiodinium-cnidarian studies. Future climate conditions and OA may favor non-calcifying, soft-bodied cnidarians, including zoanthids. Here we show that two zoanthid species, Palythoa sp. and Zoanthus sp., harboring different symbiont types (C1 and A4), had very different responses to increased temperature and increased partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)), or dissolved CO2, and low pH. Thermal stress did not affect carbon fixation or fixed carbon translocation in the Zoanthus sp./A4 association, and high pCO(2)/low pH increased carbon fixation. In contrast, both thermal stress and high pCO(2)/low pH greatly inhibited carbon fixation in the Palythoa sp./C1 association. However, the combined treatment of high temperature and high pCO(2) increased carbon fixation relative to the treatment of high temperature alone. Our observations support the growing body of evidence that demonstrates that the response of symbiotic cnidarians to thermal stress and OA must be considered on a host-specific and symbiont-specific basis. In addition, we show that the effects of increased temperature and pCO(2) on photosynthesis may change when these two stressors are combined. Understanding how carbon fixation and translocation varies among different host-symbiont combinations is critical to predicting which Symbiodinium associations may persist in warm, acidified oceans.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Graham, ER (Corresponding Author), USDA ARS, Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, 2030 SE Marine Sci Dr, Newport, OR 97365 USA.

In this respect, an impairment of photosynthesis would be responsible for light-dependent generation of toxic reactive oxygen species putatively contributing to death of symbionts and/or host cells. In some Symbiodiniaceae species, alternative photosynthetic electron flows (AEF) have been documented to occur upon a shift to high temperature, possibly contributing to photoprotection and to the balance of energetic ratio between photoproduced ATP and NADPH. By using a combination of in vivo spectrofluorimetric and oximetric techniques, we studied the capacity for electron rerouting toward oxygen and cyclic electron flow (CEF) around photosystem I in eight Symbiodiniaceae in culture belonging to Symbiodinium and Breviolum genera upon an acute shift from 25 to 33 degrees C. CEF capacity was determined as the kinetic of PSI primary donor P700 re-reduction in the presence of DCMU, a PSII inhibitor. An active oxygen uptake in light was estimated by comparing net oxygen evolution and relative electron transport rate of PSII at different light intensities. Among strains that showed elevated capacity for both AEF, some were thermotolerant while others were thermosensitive. Conversely, in some thermotolerant strains, capacities for these AEF were low upon acute heat stress. A principal component analysis of these results indicates that the long-term heat tolerant/bleached phenotype of cultured Symbiodinium and Breviolum spp. is not correlated with a capacity for different AEF across isolates during early onset of acute heat stress.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",English,"Cardol, P (Corresponding Author), Univ Liege, Genet \& Physiol Microalgues, InBioS Phytosyst, Inst Bot, Liege, Belgium.

The photosynthetic productivity (P), respiration (R), and contribution of algal carbon translocated to the host (CZAR) in response to a year's seasonal ambient changes of natural light and temperature are documented for both ZX- and ZC-bearing anemones. Light and temperature both affect photosynthesis, respiration, and CZAR, as well as various algal parameters; while there are evident seasonal differences, for the most part the relative effects on P, R, and CZAR by the two environmental variables cannot be determined. Net photosynthesis (P-n) of both ZX and ZC was significantly higher during spring and summer. During these seasons, the P-n of ZX was always greater than that of ZC. Regardless of algal symbiont, anemone respiration (R) was significantly higher during the spring and summer. The annual net carbon fixation rate of anemones with ZX and ZC was 325 and 276 mg C anemone(-1) year(-1), respectively, which translates to annual net community productivity rates of 92 and 60 g C m(-1) year(-1) for anemones with ZX or ZC, respectively. CZAR did not show a clear relationship with season; however the CZAR for ZX was always significantly greater than for ZC. Lower ZX growth rates, coupled with higher photosynthetic rates and higher CZAR estimates, compared to ZC, suggest that if A. elegantissima is simply carbon limited, ZX-bearing anemones should be the dominant symbiont in the field. However ZC-bearing anemones persist in low light and reduced temperature microhabitats, therefore more than the translocation of carbon from ZC must be involved. Given that global climate change will increase water temperatures, the potential for latitudinal range shifts of both ZC and ZX (S. californium and muscatinei) might be used as biological indicators of thermal shifts in the littoral zone of the Pacific Northwest.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",English,"Verde, EA (Corresponding Author), Main Martime Acad, Corning Sch Ocean Studies, Castine, ME 04420 USA.

Densitometry and visual inspection indicated that polyps bleached while stolons did not. When migration was triggered by temperature, light and confinement, colonies of Sarcothelia sp. decreased rates of oxygen formation in the light (due to the effects of perturbation on photosynthesis and respiration) and increased rates of oxygen uptake in the dark (due to the effects of perturbation on respiration alone). Colonies of P. parrini, by contrast, showed no significant changes in either aspect of oxygen metabolism. When migration was triggered by light and confinement, colonies of Sarcothelia sp. showed decreased rates of oxygen formation in the light and increased rates of oxygen uptake in the dark, while colonies of P. parrini maintained the former and increased the latter. During symbiont migration into their stolons, colonies of both species showed dramatic increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS), as visualized with a fluorescent probe, with stolons of Sarcothelia sp. exhibiting a nearly immediate increase of ROS. Differences in symbiont type may explain the greater sensitivity of colonies of Sarcothelia sp. Using fluorescent probes, direct measurements of migrating symbionts in the stolons of Sarcothelia sp. showed higher levels of reactive nitrogen species and lower levels of ROS than the surrounding host tissue. As measured by native fluorescence, levels of NAD(P) H in the stolons were unaffected by perturbation.

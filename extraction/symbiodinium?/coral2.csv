Photosynthesis and respiration rates of the coral with symbiotic zooxanthellae were measured in summer and winter under controlled temperatures and irradiances with a differential gas-volumeter (Productmeter). Net photosynthetic rate under all irradiances was higher in winter than in summer at the lower range of temperature (12-20degreesC), while lower than in summer at the higher range of temperature (20-30degreesC). The optimum temperature for net photosynthesis was apt to fall with the decrease of irradiance both in summer and winter, whereas it was higher in summer than in winter under each irradiance. At 25/50/100 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1), it was nearly the seawater temperature in each season. Dark respiration rate was higher in winter than in summer, especially in the range from 20-30degreesC. In both seasons the optimum temperature for gross photosynthesis was 28degreesC under 400 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1) and lowered with decreasing irradiance up to 22degreesC under 25 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1) in summer, while 20degreesC under the same irradiance in winter. The optimum temperature for production/respiration (P/R) ratio was higher in summer than in winter under each irradiance. Results indicated that metabolism of coral and zooxanthellae is adapted to ambient temperature condition under nearly natural irradiance in each season.","WILEY","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","English","Nakamura, E (Corresponding Author), Tokyo Univ Marine Sci \& Technol, Lab Phycol, Minato Ku, Konan 4-5-7, Tokyo 1088477, Japan.

So far, we know little about potential physiological adjustments of subtropical corals to seasonal temperature changes (>8 degrees C) that substantially exceed temperature fluctuation experienced by their counterparts in the tropics. This study investigated the effect of temperature reductions on Montastraea cavemosa and Ponies astreoides in Bermuda (32 degrees N; sea surface temperature similar to 19-29 degrees C) over 5 weeks, applying the following treatments: (i) constant control temperature at 28 degrees C, and (ii) temperature reduction (0.5 degrees C day(-1)) followed by constant temperature (20 days; acclimatization period) at 24 degrees C and (iii) at 20 degrees C. Both species decreased photosynthesis and respiration during temperature reduction as expected, which continued to decrease during the acclimatization period, indicating adjustment to a low energy turnover rather than thermal compensation. Trajectories of physiological adjustments and level of thermal compensation, however, differed between species. Montastraea cavemosa zooxanthellae metrics showed a strong initial response to temperature reduction, followed by a return to close to control values during the acclimatization period, reflecting a high physiological flexibility and low thermal compensation. Ponies astreoides zooxanthellae, in contrast, showed no initial response, but an increase in pigment concentration per zooxanthellae and similar photosynthesis rates at 24 degrees C and 20 degrees C at the end of the experiment, indicating low acute thermal sensitivity and the ability for thermal compensation at the lowest temperature. Respiration decreased more strongly than photosynthesis, leading to significant build-up of biomass in both species (energy reserves). Results are important in the light of potential poleward migration of corals and of potential latitudinal and species-specific differences in coral thermal tolerance.","COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD","BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND","English","Sawall, Y (Corresponding Author), Bermuda Inst Ocean Sci BIOS, 17 Ferry Reach, GE-01 St Georges, Bermuda.

There is however no information about the effect of heterotrophy on the bleaching susceptibility of corals under elevated temperature conditions. This study investigates potential interactions between food availability, basal metabolic functions (photosynthesis and respiration), energy status (lipid concentrations). total protein concentrations and the bleaching susceptibility (loss of chl and/or zooxanthellae) of the scleractinian corals Stylophora pistillata (Esper) and Galaxea fascicularis (Linnaeus) in response to elevated temperature (daily temperature rises of 3-4 degrees C) over 15 days. Feeding experiments were carried out in which the corals were either fed daily with zooplankton or starved. Compared to fed corals, starvation of both species resulted in a significant decrease in daily photosynthetic oxygen evolution over time. Gross (Pg) and net (Pn) photosynthetic production of starved corals of both species between 10:00-11:00 hrs had declined by similar to 50\% at day 15 while there were no marked changes in Pg and Pn of fed corals. After 15 days, starved S. pistillata contained significantly lower zooxanthellae densities, lipid and protein concentrations than fed corals, Starved G.fascicularis also displayed a decrease in zooxantllae densities which was accompanied by a significant decline in algal chl concentrations. Contrary to S. pistillata, feeding treatment had no effect on the lipid concentrations of G. fascicularis. Total protein concentrations however were significantly lower in straved than in fed G.fascicularis. Furthermore, starvation resulted in a significant decrease in respiration of S. pistillata during the last four days of the experiment while treatment had no effect on the respiration Fates of G. fascicularis. Overall the oxygen consumption of S. pistillata of both treatments was about 39-67\% higher than the respiration of G.fascicularis indicating that low metabolic rates may have allowed Starved G. fascicularis to conserve energy reserves over the course of the experiment. The combined results reveal a strong positive relationship between food availability, Sustained photosynthetic activity and reduced loss in pigmentation of both species under elevated temperature conditions.

It has been shown that delta(13)C can be affected by light, seawater delta(13)C(DIC), nutrition, respiration. spawning, pH and temperature. We investigated the effect of light on photosynthesis, respiration. calcification, and stable isotope composition (delta(13)C and delta(18)O) of the skeleton in the zooxanthellate scleractinian corals Acropora sp. and Stylophora pistillata. Colonies were grown on glass slides under controlled conditions in the laboratory at low and high light (LL and HL: 132 and 258 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1)). The average net photosynthesis of Acropora sp. was significantly higher under HL than under LL. The difference was not statistically significant for S. pistillata. The respiration rate did not change significantly in both species under the two light conditions. The calcification rate of S. pistillata under HL was 17-fold higher than under LL and 2.5-fold higher for Acropora sp. The average skeletal delta(13)C and 5180 of Acropora sp. were significantly more negative under LL than under HL. For S. pistillata, skeletal delta(18)O was significantly more negative in the LL than in the HL condition. The delta(13)C value of the skeleton deposited under LL was also more negative than under HL, although the difference was not statistically significant. The skeletal delta(13)C was significantly correlated with the rate of calcification. both in LL and HL. No correlation was found between skeletal 513 C and the following other physiological parameters: net and gross photosynthesis (P-n and P-g), respiration (R), and the P-g/R ratio. The increase of skeletal delta(13)C With increasing light seems to support the model of Goreau (1977). Zooxanthellae mostly fix C-12 under HL, leading to an increased concentration of C-13 in the common carbon pool which supplies dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) for calcification. Hence. the skeleton deposited is isotopically enriched in C-13. This general model needs revision to accommodate the recent finding that calcification and photosynthesis draw carbon from two reservoirs (seawater and metabolic DIC). and that respiratory CO2 is the major source of DIC for calcification. It is suggested that zooxanthellae mostly fix C-12{[}DIC] in LL; the organic matter respired, the CO2 released, and the CaCO3 deposited being therefore isotopically light. Under HL condition. zooxanthellar photosynthesis uses both {[}C-12]- and {[}C-13]DIC. The photosynthetic products catabolized by the coral, as well the respiratory CO2 and the CaCO3 precipitated are therefore heavier. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The photosynthetic productivity (P), respiration (R), and contribution of algal carbon translocated to the host (CZAR) in response to a year's seasonal ambient changes of natural light and temperature are documented for both ZX- and ZC-bearing anemones. Light and temperature both affect photosynthesis, respiration, and CZAR, as well as various algal parameters; while there are evident seasonal differences, for the most part the relative effects on P, R, and CZAR by the two environmental variables cannot be determined. Net photosynthesis (P-n) of both ZX and ZC was significantly higher during spring and summer. During these seasons, the P-n of ZX was always greater than that of ZC. Regardless of algal symbiont, anemone respiration (R) was significantly higher during the spring and summer. The annual net carbon fixation rate of anemones with ZX and ZC was 325 and 276 mg C anemone(-1) year(-1), respectively, which translates to annual net community productivity rates of 92 and 60 g C m(-1) year(-1) for anemones with ZX or ZC, respectively. CZAR did not show a clear relationship with season; however the CZAR for ZX was always significantly greater than for ZC. Lower ZX growth rates, coupled with higher photosynthetic rates and higher CZAR estimates, compared to ZC, suggest that if A. elegantissima is simply carbon limited, ZX-bearing anemones should be the dominant symbiont in the field. However ZC-bearing anemones persist in low light and reduced temperature microhabitats, therefore more than the translocation of carbon from ZC must be involved. Given that global climate change will increase water temperatures, the potential for latitudinal range shifts of both ZC and ZX (S. californium and muscatinei) might be used as biological indicators of thermal shifts in the littoral zone of the Pacific Northwest.","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","English","Verde, EA (Corresponding Author), Main Martime Acad, Corning Sch Ocean Studies, Castine, ME 04420 USA.

The coral response to a change in both light and temperature was also assessed, by subjecting coral to two treatments corresponding to winter (14 C and 30 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and summer (23 C and 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) conditions, as measured in the Ligurian Sea. Photosynthesis, measured using both respirometry and pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry, revealed a linear relationship only at low light levels. At higher irradiance, relative electron transport rate (rETR) approached saturation more slowly than rates of oxygen production. At constant temperature, a change in light did not induce any change in zooxanthellae (zoox) and chlorophyll (Chl a+c(2)) concentrations (mean 3.7x10(6) zoox cm(-2) and 14.1 mu g cm(-2), respectively); however, chlorophyll concentrations significantly increased under low light and temperature, probably in order to maintain a sufficient level of autotrophy. Maximal gross photosynthesis (Pg(max)) as well as the saturation irradiance (E(k)) and the respiration rate (R) were, however, significantly higher at 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) compared to the lower light treatments, independently of temperature conditions. Acclimation to high light appeared to be partly driven by a change in the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) capacity of the algal cells, and to a maximal rate of photon utilization. Conversely, under low light conditions, coral polyps presented a lower E(k), but also lower respiration rates, which correspond to a decrease in the energy expenditure. This ability to acclimate to different light conditions, might allow C. caespitosa to rapidly regulate its autotrophic rate in the different light conditions encountered in its natural habitats.","COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD","BIDDER BUILDING CAMBRIDGE COMMERCIAL PARK COWLEY RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 4DL, CAMBS, ENGLAND","English","Rodolfo-Metalpa, R (Corresponding Author), Marine Biol \& Ecol Res Ctr, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.

Elevated pCO(2) was shown to drastically decrease calcification rates in tropical zooxanthellate corals. Here we show, using the Mediterranean zooxanthellate coral Cladocora caespitosa, that an increase in pCO(2), in the range predicted for 2100, does not reduce its calcification rate. Therefore, the conventional belief that calcification rates will be affected by ocean acidification may not be widespread in temperate corals. Seasonal change in temperature is the predominant factor controlling photosynthesis, respiration, calcification and symbiont density. An increase in pCO(2), alone or in combination with elevated temperature, had no significant effect on photosynthesis, photosynthetic efficiency and calcification. The lack of sensitivity C. caespitosa to elevated pCO(2) might be due to its slow growth rates, which seem to be more dependent on temperature than on the saturation state of calcium carbonate in the range projected for the end of the century.","COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH","BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY","English","Rodolfo-Metalpa, R (Corresponding Author), IAEA, Marine Environm Labs, 4 Quai Antoine Ier, MC-98000 Principality Of Monaco, Monaco.

"X.WOS.000456933400001","article","Galli, Giovanni and Solidoro, Cosimo","ATP Supply May Contribute to Light-Enhanced Calcification in Corals More Than Abiotic Mechanisms","FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE","2018","5",NA,NA,"MAR 1","Zooxanthellate corals are known to increase calcification rates when exposed to light, a phenomenon called light-enhanced calcification that is believed to be mediated by symbionts' photosynthetic activity. There is controversy over the mechanism behind this phenomenon, with hypotheses coarsely divided between abiotic and biologically-mediated mechanisms. At the same time, accumulating evidence shows that calcification in corals relies on active ion transport to deliver the skeleton building blocks into the calcifying medium, making it is an energetically costly activity. Here we build on generally accepted conceptual models of the coral calcification machinery and conceptual models of the energetics of coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis to develop a model that can be used to isolate the biologically-mediated and abiotic effects of photosynthesis, respiration, temperature, and seawater chemistry on coral calcification rates and related metabolic costs. We tested this model on data from the Mediterranean scleractinian Cladocora caespitosa, an acidification resistant species. We concluded that most of the variation in calcification rates due to photosynthesis, respiration and temperature can be attributed to biologically-mediated mechanisms, in particular to the ATP supplied to the active ion transports. Abiotic effects are also present but are of smaller magnitude. Instead, the decrease in calcification rates caused by acidification, albeit small, is sustained by both abiotic and biologically-mediated mechanisms. However, there is a substantial extra cost of calcification under acidified conditions. Based on these findings and on a literature review we suggest that the energy aspect of coral calcification might have been so far underappreciated.","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","English","Galli, G (Corresponding Author), Natl Inst Oceanog \& Expt Geophys OGS, Dept Oceanog OCE, Sgonico, Italy.

A temperature of 25 degrees C and a light intensity of 200 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1) was the starting culture condition. Metabolic (photosynthesis, respiration, calcification and surface expansion rate) and geochemical measurements (delta O-18, delta C-13, Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca) were conducted on 6 colonies for each experimental condition. Metabolic measurements confirmed that respiration, photosynthesis, calcification and surface expansion rate responded to the combined effect of temperature and light. Under each light intensity, mean calcification rate was linearly correlated with mean photosynthetic activity. Geochemical measurements were also influenced by temperature and, to a lesser degree, by light. All geochemical proxies measured on 6 nubbins showed a wide scattering of values, regardless of the environmental condition. Compared to the other proxies, delta O-18 exhibited a different behavior. It was the only proxy exhibiting temperature tracer behavior. However, while mean values of Sr/Ca, Mg/Ca and delta C-13 were well correlated, the correlation between the later and mean delta O-18 differed with light level. This suggests that both skeleton deposition and temperature oxygen fractionation differs according to light intensity. Overall, the effect of light on geochemical values seems to compromise the use of proxy calibrations solely based on temperature influence. Under high light conditions, the great amplitude shown by individual net photosynthesis is directly proportional to the highly variable zooxanthellae density. As light is affecting all of the proxies, we thus assume that the strong geochemical variability observed could be explained by various algae densities, each nubbin responding according to its zooxanthellae amount. Accordingly, we suggest that each symbiosome (the assemblage of few corallites with their symbionts) presents its own vital effect influence over time. Therefore, at a bulk sample scale, light could be considered as one of the major causes of what is commonly referred to as the `vital effect'. The meaning of delta O-18 calibration versus temperature established from distinct colonies differs from calibration calculated from samples collected following the growth axis of a single coral head. Finally, in order to quantitatively reconstruct climatic condition, we suggest a new paradigm based on the statistical treatment of the combination of time-series information from several proxies, all measured on the same sample from a continuous symbiosome.

Anthropogenic activities have resulted in increased atmospheric CO2 levels and a subsequent rise in ocean temperatures. In addition to increasing water temperature, elevated CO2 levels are leading to a decrease in oceanic pH (ocean acidification). These two changes have the potential to alter ecological processes within the oceans, including the outcome of competitive coral-macroalgal interactions. In our study, we explored the combined effect of temperature increase and ocean acidification on the competition between the coral Porites lobata and on the Great Barrier Reef abundant macroalga Chlorodesmis fastigiata. A temperature increase of +1 degrees C above present temperatures and CO2 increase of +85 ppm were used to simulate a low end emission scenario for the mid- to late 21st century, according to the Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6 (RCP2.6). Our results revealed that the net photosynthesis of P. lobata decreased when it was in contact with C. fastigiata under ambient conditions, and that dark respiration increased under RCP2.6 conditions. The Photosynthesis to Respiration (P:R) ratios of corals as they interacted with macroalgal competitors were not significantly different between scenarios. Dark calcification rates of corals under RCP2.6 conditions, however, were negative and significantly decreased compared to ambient conditions. Light calcification rates were negatively affected by the interaction of macroalgal contact in the RCP2.6 scenario, compared to algal mimics and to coral under ambient conditions. Chlorophyll a, and protein content increased in the RCP2.6 scenario, but were not influenced by contact with the macroalga. We conclude that the coral host was negatively affected by RCP2.6 conditions, whereas the productivity of its symbionts (zooxanthellae) was enhanced. While a negative effect of the macroalga (C. fastigiata) on the coral (P. lobata) was observed for the P:R ratio under control conditions, it was not enhanced under RCP2.6 conditions.","ELSEVIER","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","English","RÃ¶lfer, L (Corresponding Author), Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res ZMT, Fahrenheitstr 6, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.

Colonies of this species were grown in the field for a 21/2 year study period, during which the rates of photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification were measured on fifteen separate occasions, spaced approximately equally throughout the study period. The corals were stained with alizarin-red S within seven days after each set of physiological measurements. At the end of the period the corals were sacrificed and their skeletal extension, density, and skeletal delta(13)C determined. Despite substantial high-frequency variations, a strong seasonal cycle was evident in the skeletal delta(13)C records of all the corals throughout the experimental period. The skeletal delta(13)C and delta(18)O values varied approximately in phase, and showed a weak, but statistically significant positive relationship with each other. The delta(13)C Of the coral skeletons, when corrected for changes in the delta(13)C of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIG), exhibited an inverse correlation with P/R, a finding opposite to what was expected based on current models of isotopic fractionation in coral skeletons. Although such findings tend to support the model of fret (1978) that increases in photosynthesis act to isotopically deplete the delta(13)C of the coral skeleton, we note that the inverse association between delta(13)C and P/R arises because of a slight positive association between delta(13)C and respiration. We therefore believe that the association may be a result of seasonal variation in some parameters of the system which was not constrained in our study. Alternatives include (1) variations in the delta(13)C of the DIC which are translated into the delta(13)C Of the food chain, (2) changes from heterotrophy to autotrophy, and (3) changes in the partitioning of delta(13)C between the zooxanthellae and the coral tissue. Based on previous studies which we have carried out we believe that changes in the skeletal delta(13)C are not related to sexual reproduction or growth rate. Contrary to previous work we were unable to measure any significant differences in the skeletal delta(13)C between the fast growing tops of the coral and the slower growing sides.","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","English","Swart, PK (Corresponding Author), UNIV MIAMI, ROSENSTIEL SCH MARINE \& ATMOSPHER SCI, DIV MARINE GEOL \& GEOPHYS, MIAMI, FL 33149 USA.

Here we evaluated the environmental conditions and benthic community structures in semi-closed Nikko Bay at the inner reef area in Palau, which has high pCO(2) and seawater temperature conditions with high zooxanthellate coral coverage. Nikko Bay is a highly sheltered system with organisms showing low connectivity with surrounding environments, making this bay a unique site for evaluating adaptation and acclimatization responses of organisms to warmed and acidified environments. Seawater pCO(2)/Omega (arag) showed strong gradation ranging from 380 to 982 mu atm (Omega (arag): 1.79-3.66), and benthic coverage, including soft corals and turf algae, changed along with Omega (arag) while hard coral coverage did not change. In contrast to previous studies, net calcification was maintained in Nikko Bay even under very low mean Omega (arag) (2.44). Reciprocal transplantation of the dominant coral Porites cylindrica showed that the calcification rate of corals from Nikko Bay did not change when transplanted to a reference site, while calcification of reference site corals decreased when transplanted to Nikko Bay. Corals transplanted out of their origin sites also showed the highest interactive respiration (R) and lower gross photosynthesis (Pg) to respiration (Pg:R), indicating higher energy acquirement of corals at their origin site. The results of this study give important insights about the potential local acclimatization and adaptation capacity of corals to different environmental conditions including pCO(2) and temperature.","NATURE PORTFOLIO","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY","English","Kurihara, H (Corresponding Author), Univ Ryukyus, Fac Sci, Dept Chem Biol \& Marine Sci, 1 Senbaru, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030213, Japan.

The overall annual range of seawater temperature in Obhur Creek was between 24.5 degrees C and 33 degrees C . Zooxanthellae abundance and diversity showed seasonal variations: the number of zooxanthellae in P. damicornis was slightly higher than in P. verrucosa, and the abundance of zooxanthellae of both species was low in summer and high during winter. The respiration rate of P. verrucosa did not vary between summer and winter, suggesting compensatory acclimation. In contrast, the respiratory rate in P. damicornis was lower in winter than in summer. During the winter season the metabolic rate was higher in both species owing to the optimum seawater temperature (30 degrees C). As a result of the abundance of zooxanthellae and the optimum seawater temperature, the growth rates of the skeletons of the two coral species were higher in winter and lower in summer. In general, the results showed that P. verrucosa is more flexible with respect to temperature than P. damicornis. The difference in zooxanthellae thermal tolerances at 35 degrees C may be due to the algal genotypes between the two species, resulting in P. damicornis becoming bleached as the rate of metabolism exceeds the rate of photosynthesis with increasing temperature.","POLISH ACAD SCIENCES INST OCEANOLOGY","POWSTANCOW WASZAWY 55, PL-81-712 SOPOT, POLAND","English","Al-Sofyani, AA (Corresponding Author), King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Marine Sci, Dept Marine Biol, Post Box 80207, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.

Impacts of global warming, which is generally perceived as the most serious threat to coral reefs today, often coincide with various common anthropogenic disturbances, such as pollution and overharvesting. To better evaluate the impact of global warming, interactions between elevated temperature and background disturbance should be investigated. In this study, the physiological response of the reef-building coral Porites cylindrica was investigated, when exposed to enrichment of dissolved inorganic nitrate (+ 15 muM for 14 days) and elevated seawater temperature ( + 2 C for 48 h), in the absence of particulate food. It was shown that P. cvlindrica was able to tolerate the temperature exposure without losing symbiotic microalgae or chlorophyll pigments, although the photosynthetic capacity was affected. Nitrate enrichment significantly reduced primary production rate, although zooxanthella population density and chlorophyll concentrations were not affected. The combination of elevated temperature and nitrate enrichment produced an even more pronounced reduction of the production rate. Since coral respiration rate remained unaffected by the treatments, this implies that the corals were unable to acclimate to impaired photosynthesis. However, there was no indication of subsequently reduced tissue growth or increased host catabolism based on tissue biomass measurements. On the other hand, all corals, including controls, lost tissue biomass during the exposure, suggesting a dependence on particulate food. Our results imply that corals on nutrient-exposed reefs may be more stressed during periods of elevated temperature, compared to corals in more pristine areas.","SPRINGER-VERLAG","175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA","English","Nordemar, I (Corresponding Author), Univ Stockholm, Dept Syst Ecol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.

The recurrent patterns of sunlight are reflected in fluorescence yields, photosynthetic pigment content and activity of the two protective enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), enzymes that are among the universal defenses against free radical damage in living tissue. All of these were investigated in three scleractinian corals: Favia favus, Plerogyra sinuosa and Goniopora lobata. The activity of SOD and CAT in the animal host followed the course of solar radiation, increased with the rates of photosynthetic oxygen production and was correlated with a decrease in the maximum quantum yield of photochemistry in Photosystem H (PSII) (Delta F'/F-m'). SOD and CAT activity in the symbiotic algae also exhibited a light intensity correlated pattern, albeit a less pronounced one. The observed rise of the free-radical-scavenger enzymes, with a time scale of minutes to several hours, is an important protective mechanism for the existence and remarkable success of the unique cnidarian-dinoflagellate associations, in which photosynthetic oxygen production takes place within animal cells. This represents a facet of the precarious act of balancing the photosynthetic production of oxygen by the algal symbionts with their destructive action on all living cells, especially those of the animal host.","COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD","BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND","English","Levy, O (Corresponding Author), Univ Queensland, Ctr Marine Studies, Copper Rd,Gehrmann Bldg Bldg 60, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.

Ocean acidification involves the decrease of both the pH and the calcium carbonate saturation state. Ocean acidification is predicted to impact the physiology of marine organisms and reduce the calcification rates of corals. In the present study, we measured the rates of calcification, respiration, photosynthesis, and zooxanthellae density of the tropical coral Acropora digitifera under near-natural summertime temperature and sunlight for a 5-week period. We found that these key physiological parameters were not affected by both mid-CO2 (pCO(2) = 744 +/- A 38, pH = 7.97 +/- A 0.02, Omega(arag) = 2.6 +/- A 0.1) and high-CO2 conditions (pCO(2) = 2,142 +/- A 205, pH = 7.56 +/- A 0.04, Omega(arag) = 1.1 +/- A 0.2) throughout the 35 days experimental period. Additionally, there was no significant correlation between calcification rate and seawater aragonite saturation (Omega(arag)).

The mechanism that triggers this expulsion of the algal symbionts is not resolved, but has been attributed to damage to the photosynthetic mechanism of the zooxanthellae. In the present investigation we addressed the question of whether such expelled zooxanthellae are indeed impaired irreversibly in their photosynthesis. We employed a Microscopy Pulse Amplitude-Modulated (PAM) fluorometer, by which individual zooxanthellae can be examined to study photosynthesis in zooxanthellae expelled when corals are subjected to a temperature of 33 degreesC. We show that the expelled zooxanthellae from Cyphastrea serailia were largely unaffected in their photosynthesis and could be heated to 37 degreesC before showing temperature-induced photosynthetic impairment. These results suggest strongly that the early events that trigger temperature-induced expulsion of zooxanthellae involve a dysfunction in the interaction of the zooxanthellae and the coral host tissue, and not a dysfunction in the zooxanthellae per se.","INTER-RESEARCH","NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY","English","Ralph, PJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Technol Sydney, Dept Environm Sci, POB 123 Broadway, Sydney, NSW 2065, Australia.

Changes in annual resolution delta C-13 levels from the South China Sea (SCS) were studied to explore the biological and climatic significance of coral delta C-13 during the mid-Holocene. The growth-rate-related kinetic isotope effect on modern coral delta C-13 may be limited, site- and/or colony-specific. Furthermore, coral delta C-13 and sea surface temperatures (SST) are inversely related, but their correlation is weak. These results suggest the influence of complicated controlling factors on modern coral delta C-13. As for the mid-Holocene corals, no obvious growth-rate-related kinetic isotope effect has been found in their coral delta C-13 series, and the effect of solar irradiation on coral delta C-13 is difficult to directly evaluate for the low resolution of reconstructed solar records and the dating errors. However, mid-Holocene coral delta C-13 series show temperature-dependent changes over the studied periods during 6100-6500 yr BP. The significant negative correlation between coral delta C-13 and SST has been attributed to the high SSTs during the mid-Holocene. This is based on the observation that coral delta C-13 and the photosynthesis to respiration ratio (P/R) are usually positively related, but P/R is significantly and negatively related to temperature under high temperature conditions in that photosynthetic activity of heat-stressed corals will drastically reduce due to the decreases of population density and photosynthetic rate of the zooxanthellae.

We studied the effects of high seawater temperature and bacterial challenges on bleaching, metabolism, and antioxidant defenses of coral. The coral Montipora digitate and five bacterial strains (Vibrio coralliilyticus, Vibrio harveyi, Paracoccus carotinifaciens, Pseudoalteromonas sp., and Sulfitobacter sp.) were used in an inoculation experiment. The bacteria were isolated from the bleached corals and their surrounding seawater. At normal temperatures, the bacteria did not cause coral bleaching and did not affect metabolism or antioxidant enzyme activities. However, bacterial challenges in addition to high-temperature stress resulted in coral bleaching, with a 70\% decrease in zooxanthellae density compared with the control, a 25\% decrease in photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm), a 66\% decrease in photosynthesis, and a 101\% reduction in calcification activity. Tissue necrosis was observed in the most compromised branches. Respiration and activity levels of antioxidant enzymes were not affected. Corals under thermal stress alone showed signs of bleaching, but the changes in zooxanthellae density and metabolic rates were less severe than those under synergistic thermal stress and bacterial challenge. Among the bacteria examined, Sulfitobacter sp. had a greater capacity to enhance and accelerate the bleaching process under thermal stress. The mechanisms by which bacteria affect corals are not yet understood. Direct actions include infection and production of toxic substances by bacteria; indirect effects due to changes in the bacterial community under the influence of added bacteria must also be considered. Our results suggest that bacterial challenges combined with thermal stress can synergistically lead to negative outcomes in corals. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Symbiont cell diameter and volume were higher during January than September. Although zooxanthella-specific chlorophyll was independent of jellyfish size, both chlorophyll a and c were higher during January. Regardless of season, algal density and jellyfish size were inversely related. The diel mitotic index (MI) of zooxanthellae was phased, with a peak of 0.25\% occurring between 09:00 and 12:00 h. September photosynthetic rates were always higher than January rates and reflected the seasonal light and temperature regimes at the latitude of the Florida Keys (USA). Photosynthesis, when normalized to either zooxanthella density or protein, displayed an inverse relationship with jellyfish size. Medusan respiration rates also showed an inverse relationship with jellyfish size, with September metabolism being higher than that of January. The carbon budgets calculated for these medusae indicate that the carbon photosynthetically fixed by the zooxanthellae, and subsequently translocated to the host, is capable of satisfying about 169\% of the host's metabolic demand (CZAR) and is independent of both jellyfish size and season. These seasonally influenced physiological effects underscore the necessity for seasonal examinations of algal-cnidarian symbioses in order to understand the photophysiology of the association on an annual basis.","INTER-RESEARCH","NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY","English","Verde, EA (Corresponding Author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, 3029 Cordley Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.

In this study the effects of high temperature and light on zooxanthellae living in the Caribbean reef corals Montastrea annularis, M. cavernosa, Agaricia agaricites, and A. lamarcki were studied. Pieces of coral colonies were incubated at ambient seawater temperature (26 degrees + 1 degrees), and at 30 degrees, 32 degrees, and 34 degrees C. Symbiotic algae from M. annularis, a species of coral from the forereef that commonly bleaches, showed the following sequence of events when exposed to natural light at 32 degrees C: loss of photosynthetic potential measured as fluorescence yield, corresponding reduction of both oxygen production per zooxanthella and P:R (photosynthesis:respiration) ratio, and subsequent reduction in density of algae in relation to surface area of the coral. These parameters were not signifcantly reduced and no deaths occurred for M. annularis or any other coral species maintained at 26 degrees or 30 degrees C. However, the sequence of events was condensed to less than 24 h when M. annularis was subjected to 34 degrees C seawater, except that there was little if any reduction in algal density before tissue-sloughing and death occurred between 10 and 24 h. Loss of significant amounts of chlorophyll a per alga was not evident for any corals except those maintained at 34 degrees C longer than 10 h. In contrast, symbiotic algae in M. cavernosa, a species that rarely bleaches in nature, showed only slight reductions in photosynthesis and fluorescence yield, and no significant loss of algal cells or chlorophyll a, when maintained in seawater at 32 degrees C for 2 days. Thus zooxanthellae in M. cavernosa appeared to be less affected by sublethal high-temperature stress. Similar contrasting patterns of bleaching were seen in zooxanthellae from the plating coral Agaricia lamarcki, which often bleaches during the late summer and fall, compared with zooxanthellae from A. agaricites, a coral which bleaches less frequently. In addition, M. annularis exposed to sublethal high temperatures and ambient light bleached faster than those kept in dimmer light, supporting past field observations suggesting that light energy is an important component of bleaching in nature. When M. annularis was exposed to different wavelengths of natural light at 32 degrees C, the fluorescence yield declined more quickly in the presence of higher energy UV-A and blue light than with other photosynthetically active radiation. Natural levels of UV-B had little effect in this study. These data suggest that the patterns of bleaching seen in nature may be at least partially explained by different tolerances of the symbiotic algae in the corals, and that light plays a significant role in bleaching.","MARINE BIOL LAB","BIOLOGICAL BULL MBL STREET, WOODS HOLE, MA 02543","English","Fitt, WK (Corresponding Author), UNIV GEORGIA,INST ECOL,ATHENS,GA 30602, USA.","10.2307/1542147","0006-3185",NA,NA,"ULTRAVIOLET-RADIATION; MONTASTREA-ANNULARIS; ELEVATED-TEMPERATURE; MORTALITY; EVENT; SALINITY; HAWAIIAN; STRESS; PANAMA; LIGHT","Life Sciences \& Biomedicine - Other Topics; Marine \& Freshwater Biology","Biology; Marine \& Freshwater Biology",NA,NA,"35","214","0","74","Biol.

We examined the influence of prior exposure to high temperature on the photoinhibition-sensitivity of photosynthetic activity in the zooxanthellae of two bleaching-susceptible corals, Stylophora pistillata and Montipora digitata, and two bleaching-tolerant corals, Pachyseris rugosa and Pavona divaricata from Okinawa, Japan. Coral fragments were acclimated either at 24 or 31degreesC for 5 days, and then exposed to high light (1,200 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1)) for 2 h at 24 or 31degreesC. Bleaching-susceptible species acclimated at 31degreesC showed significant increase in photosynthetic activity (P-max) and total chlorophyll content, while bleaching-tolerant species showed the opposite pattern. The rate of dark respiration (R) was significantly higher in fragments acclimated at 31degreesC than in those acclimated at 24degreesC in all investigated coral species. F-v/F-m decreased to a similar extent after high light treatment at 31degreesC in corals acclimated at 24 and 31degreesC in both tolerant and susceptible species. Pmax and chlorophyll content of bleaching-susceptible corals showed a more pronounced decline after high light exposure at 31degreesC than those of bleaching-tolerant species. The extent of reduction in P-max and chlorophyll content was significantly higher in fragments of S. pistillata and M. digitata acclimated at 31degreesC than in those acclimated at 24degreesC. Significant decrease in R was evident only in susceptible species acclimated at 31degreesC and exposed to high light at 31degreesC. These results suggest that mechanisms underlying the thermal acclimation of photosynthesis vary with coral species. A high photosynthetic acclimation potential to temperature might be associated with a response of P-max but not F-v/F-m. Susceptibility of S. pistillata and M. digitata to synergistic effects of high light and elevated temperature depends on a decreased capacity of their zooxanthellae to cope with photodamage, although the role of the host can not be excluded.","SPRINGER","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","English","Yakovleva, I (Corresponding Author), Univ Ryukyus, Dept Chem Biol \& Marine Sci, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030213, Japan.

Therefore, this study investigated N-2 fixation of 2 dominant zooxanthellate soft coral groups (Sarcophyton sp. and Xeniidae) in a northern Red Sea fringing reef during all 4 seasons of 1 yr. This was supplemented by respirometry incubations and in situ monitoring of key environmental parameters. Findings revealed detectable N-2 fixation for both soft corals during all seasons. Annual N-2 fixation by Sarcophyton sp. was 3 times higher than that by Xeniidae, but both soft corals exhibited similar seasonal patterns. N-2 fixation significantly increased during summer, when water temperature and light intensity were highest and inorganic nutrient availability was lowest. Coral respiration also peaked during summer and was positively correlated to N-2 fixation, while photosynthesis revealed maximum rates during the nutrient-enriched spring season. Given the importance of N for reproduction and growth, N-2 fixation may be a key component of soft coral nutrition during summer, when inorganic nutrient availability in the water column is lowest and likely not sufficient to sustain the high metabolic demand of soft corals.","INTER-RESEARCH","NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY","English","Bednarz, VN (Corresponding Author), Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Ecol ZMT, Coral Reef Ecol Grp CORE, Fahrenheitstr 6, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.

To determine the role of zooxanthellae in the bleaching process, aposymbiotic sea anemones from Bermuda (Aiptasia pallida) were infected with symbionts from other sea anemones (Aiptasia pallida from Florida, Bartholomea annulata and Condylactis gigantea). The expulsion of algae was measured during 24-h incubations at 25, 32 and 34 degreesC. Photosynthetic rates of freshly isolated zooxanthellae were also measured at these temperatures. The C. gigantea (Cg) symbionts were expelled in higher numbers than the other algae at 32 degreesC. Photosynthesis by the Cg algae was completely inhibited at this temperature, in contrast to the other symbionts. At 34 degrees all of the symbionts had increased expulsion rates, and at this temperature only the symbionts from Florida A. pallida exhibited any photosynthesis. These results provide the first evidence that the differential release of symbionts from the same host species is related to decreased photosynthesis at elevated temperatures, and support other findings suggesting that zooxanthellae are directly affected by elevated temperatures during bleaching events.

The coral host plays a major role in supplying carbon for the photosynthesis by the algal symbionts through a system similar to the carbon-concentrating mechanism described in free living algal cells;The details of carbon supply to the calcification process are almost unknown, but metabolic CO2 seems to be a significant source; Calcium supply for calcification is diffusional through oral layers, and active membrane transport only occurs between the calicoblastic cells and the site of calcification. Photosynthesis and calcification are tightly coupled in zooxanthellate scleractinian corals and coral reef communities. Calcification Is, on average, three times higher in light than in darkness. The recent suggestion that calcification is dark-repressed rather than light-enhanced is not supported by the literature. There is a very strong correlation between photosynthesis and calcification at both the organism and community levels, but the ratios of calcification to gross photosynthesis (0.6 in corals and 0.2 in reef communities) differ from unity, and from each other as a function of level. The potential effect of global climatic changes (pCO(2) and temperature) on the rate of calcification is also reviewed. In various calcifying photosynthetic organisms and communities, the rate of calcification decreases as a function of increasing pCO(2) and decreasing calcium carbonate saturation state, The calculated decrease in CaCO3 production, estimated using the scenarios considered by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), is 10\% between 1880 and 1990, and 9-30\% (mid estimate: 22\%) from 1990 to 2100. Inadequate understanding of the mechanism of calcification and its interaction with photosynthesis severely limits the ability to provide an accurate prediction of future changes in the rate of calcification.","SOC INTEGRATIVE COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY","1313 DOLLEY MADISON BLVD, NO 402, MCLEAN, VA 22101 USA","English","Gattuso, JP (Corresponding Author), UPMC, CNRS, UPRESA 7076, LOBEPM,Observ Oceanol, BP 28, F-06234 Villefranche Sur Mer, France.

The present study compared the photosystem II (PSII) functioning and overall photosynthesis of retained and released zooxanthellae from the reef-building coral Galaxea fascicularis exposed to high temperature stress. The use of pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) fluorometry for isolated zooxanthellae was validated and used to measure photosynthesis. There was no significant difference in PSII functioning and the overall photosynthesis between retained zooxanthellae, which were isolated immediately after stress treatment, and those released from the coral exposed to either 30 or 32degreesC. while the zooxanthellae population released at 28degreesC showed significantly lower PSII functioning than those retained in the polyps. The release of healthy-looking zooxanthellae by polyps exposed to elevated temperatures was significantly higher than those in the control (28degreesC). Higher release of undischarged cnidae, indicative of host cell necrosis or detachment, was observed in 32degreesC treatments. These findings indicate that the zooxanthellae released in 30 or 32degreesC treatments exhibited normal morphology and intact photosynthetic activity. The present results strongly suggest that the release of zooxanthellae from G. fascicularis at 30 or 32degreesC is a non-selective process with respect to the zoo-xanthellar PSII functioning and thus the host seems to be the first partner to be physiologically affected in temperature-induced bleaching.","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","English","Hidaka, M (Corresponding Author), Univ Ryukyus, Dept Chem Biol \& Marine Sci, Okinawa 9030213, Japan.

Given the broad vertical intertidal and latitudinal range of this anemone, we investigated the role of temperature in determining whether A. elegantissima supports one algal symbiont over the other and whether temperature regulates the observed distributions of natural populations of ZX and ZC. Temperature appears to be a key factor in regulating both the photophysiology and metabolism of this algal-cnidarian association. In anemones containing ZX, neither algal densities nor chlorophyll content varied with temperature (6-24.degreesC); in contrast, anemones with ZC displayed reduced densities and chlorophyll content at the highest temperature treatment (24 degreesC). Both. ZX and ZC photosynthetic rates were directly related to temperature, as were anemone respiration rates. The higher photosynthetic rates, maintenance of a stable algal density and chlorophyll content, and higher potential contribution of algal carbon toward animal respiration (CZAR) suggest that the ZX are the more viable symbiont as temperature increases, but we suggest alternative reasons why ZC are preserved in this symbiotic association. Elevated temperatures reduce ZC densities and chlorophyll, suggesting that higher temperatures affect this relationship in a negative fashion, presumably due to a higher cost of maintaining ZC by the association; alternatively, these costs may be affiliated with the deterioration of the ZC themselves. These results suggest that temperature may be one of the most significant environmental parameters that sets the intertidal microhabitat and latitudinal distribution patterns of the two algal taxa observed in the field.","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","English","Verde, EA (Corresponding Author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, 3029 Cordley Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.

However, information on such occurrences is still very rare. Ten Porites coral cores were drilled from the Wenchang fringing reef of Hainan Island, northern South China Sea. These cores contain mortality surfaces and/or growth discontinuities dating from the mid-late Holocene between 3.4 and 5.7 thousand years ago (ka, before 1950 AD). Monthly Sr/Ca, delta O-18 and delta C-13 were analyzed to reconstruct sea-surface temperature (SST), sea-surface salinity (SSS), and photosynthesis intensity during the events. Results show that the mortality surfaces and growth discontinuities of five corals are associated with high SST of 30.3 degrees C-33.6 degrees C and high SSS of 34.3-38.3. The abrupt concurrent negative shifts of 1.8 parts per thousand or more in delta C-13 indicate a decrease in the photosynthesis intensity, most likely attributable to the loss of zooxanthellae. These lines of evidence imply that the mortality surfaces and growth discontinuities were the consequence of coral bleaching under abnormally high temperature. The observed recovery directly after bleaching events indicates that corals in the South China Sea are capable of rehabilitation after experiencing severe environmental stresses.","ELSEVIER","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","English","Yu, KF (Corresponding Author), Guangxi Univ, Coral Reef Res Ctr China, Sch Marine Sci, Guangxi Lab Study Coral Reefs South China Sea, Nanning 530004, Peoples R China.

Light stimulates coral growth by the process of light-enhanced calcification, which is mediated by zooxanthellar photosynthesis. However, the quantity of light that is available for daily coral growth is not only determined by light intensity (i.e. irradiance), but also by photoperiod (i.e. the light duration time). Understanding and optimizing conditions for coral growth is essential for sustainable coral aquaculture. Therefore, in this study, the question was explored whether more light (i.e. more photons), presented either as irradiance or as light duration, would result in more growth. A series of nine genetically identical coral colonies of Galaxea fascicularis L. were cultured for a period of 18 weeks at different light duration times (8 hours 150 mu E m(-2) s(-1):16 hours dark, 12 hours 150 mu E m(-2) s(-1):12 hours dark, 16 hours 150 mu E m(-2) s(-1):8 hours dark, 24 hours 150 mu E m(-2) s(-1):0 hours dark) and different irradiance levels (8 hours 150 mu E m(-2) s(-1):16 hours dark, 8 hours 225 mu E m(-2) s(-1):16 hours dark and 8 hours 300 mu E m(-2) s(-1): 16 hours dark). Growth was determined every two weeks by measuring buoyant weight. Temperature, salinity and feeding levels were kept constant during the experiment. To detect possible acclimation of the corals to an increased light duration, rates of net photosynthesis and dark respiration were measured, hereby comparing coral colonies grown under an 8:16 hours light (150 mu E m(-2) s(-1)): dark cycle with corals grown under a 16:8 hours light (150 mu E m(-2) s(-1)): dark cycle. No increase in growth was detected with either increasing photoperiod or irradiance. Continuous lighting (24 hours 150 mu E m(-2) s(-1):0 hours dark) resulted in immediate bleaching and the corals died after 14 weeks. Hourly photosynthetic rates were significantly reduced in the 16 hour light treatment compared to the 8 hour light treatment. As a result, daily net photosynthetic rates were not significantly different, which may explain the observed specific growth rates. Acclimation to photoperiod duration appeared neither to be mediated by changes in chlorophyll-a concentration nor zooxanthellae density. Based on the results of this study, we can conclude that the enhancing effect of light on coral growth is not only a matter of photons. Obviously, the availability of light was not limiting growth in these experiments and was probably in excess (i.e. stressful amounts). Other factors are discussed that play a role in determining growth rates and might explain our results.","CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","English","Schutter, M (Corresponding Author), Wageningen Univ, Aquaculture \& Fisheries Grp, POB 338, NL-6700 AH Wageningen, Netherlands.

In both species, biometric parameters varied more with temperature than with solar radiation. In the zooxanthellate species, temperature explained a higher percentage of biometric parameter variance than in the azooxanthellate species. While environmental factors did not co-vary with demographic characteristics in L. pruvoti, temperature was negatively related to the population density of B. europaea.

Coral bleaching events of unprecedented frequency and global extent have been reported during the last two decades. Recently, we demonstrated that bleaching of the coral Oculina patagonica in the Mediterranean Sea is caused by the bacterium Vibrio shiloi, when seawater temperature rises and allows the bacterium to become virulent. The first step in the infection process is host-specific adhesion of V. shiloi to O. patagonica via a beta-galactoside receptor on the coral surface. The bacterium then penetrates into the coral tissue and produces extracellular materials which rapidly inhibit photosynthesis of zooxanthellae and bleach and lyse the algae. The inhibition of pothosynthesis is due to a low molecular weight, heat stable toxin and ammonia. Bleaching and lysis are due to a heat-labile, high molecular weight materials, probably lytic enzymes. Elevated temperature induces different virulence factors within the infectious agent of the disease, V. shiloi. Adhesion was found to be temperature-regulated. When the bacteria were grown at 16 degrees C there was no adhesion to corals maintained at either 25 degrees C or 16 degrees. However, when the bacteria were grown at 25 degrees C they adhered avidly to corals maintained at 16 degrees C and 25 degrees C. In addition, the production of lytic enzymes and the photosynthesis inhibitor was also found to be temperature dependent. Production of the latter toxin was ten times greater at 29 degrees C than at 16 degrees C, and extracellular protease was 5-fold higher in cultures grown at 29 degrees C than at 16 degrees C. The data presented here suggest an explanation for the correlation between elevated seawater temperatures and seasonal coral bleaching.","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","English","Banin, F (Corresponding Author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Mol Microbiol \& Biotechnol, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.

Significantly higher cellular concentrations of superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide are observed when cultures of Symbiodinium bermudense are exposed to elevated temperatures with and without exposure to UV radiation. This increase in oxidative stress is accompanied by a reduction in the quantum yield of fluorescence for photosystem 2 and protein-specific activities of the carboxylating enzyme, Rubisco. An increase in antioxidant enzyme activities is unable to protect these cells from oxidative stress during exposure to UV radiation and elevated temperatures (31 degrees C). The addition of exogenous scavengers of active oxygen, however, improves photosynthetic performance, but not to pre-exposure rates in zooxanthellae exposed to both elevated temperature and UV radiation, confirming a role for oxidative stress in the inhibition of photosynthesis by UV radiation and elevated temperatures. After exposure of zooxanthellae to UV radiation and elevated temperatures, an action spectrum for the inhibition of photosynthesis shows significantly greater wavelength-dependent effects of UV radiation between 290 and 375 nm than for zooxanthellae exposed to UV radiation alone.","AMER SOC LIMNOLOGY OCEANOGRAPH","810 EAST 10TH ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044-8897","English","BIGELOW LAB OCEAN SCI,BOOTHBAY HARBOR,ME 04575.","10.4319/lo.1996.41.2.0271","0024-3590",NA,NA,"SYMBIODINIUM-MICROADRIATICUM FREUDENTHAL; SEA-ANEMONE; ANTHOPLEURA-ELEGANTISSIMA; MARINE-PHYTOPLANKTON; ENDOSYMBIOTIC ALGAE; AIPTASIA-PALLIDA; EARTHS SURFACE; NATURAL-WATERS; REEF CORALS; SP-NOV","Marine \& Freshwater Biology; Oceanography","Limnology; Oceanography",NA,"Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences","74","459","6","162","Limnol.

Extensive field studies across a latitudinal temperature gradient highlight detrimental effects of rising temperatures on its growth, demography, and skeletal characteristics, suggesting that depression of photosynthesis at high temperatures might cause these negative effects. Here we test this hypothesis by analyzing, by means of pulse amplitude modulation fluorometry, the photosynthetic efficiency of B. europaea specimens exposed in aquaria to the annual range of temperatures experienced in the field (13, 18, and 28 degrees C), and two extreme temperatures expected for 2100 as a consequence of global warming (29 and 32 degrees C). The indicators of photosynthetic performance analyzed (maximum and effective quantum yield) showed that maximum efficiency was reached at 20.0-21.6 degrees C, slightly higher than the annual mean temperature in the field (18 degrees C). Photosynthetic efficiency decreased from 20.0 to 13 degrees C and even more strongly from 21.6 to 32 degrees C. An unusual form of bleaching was observed, with a maximum zooxanthellae density at 18 degrees C that strongly decreased from 18 to 32 degrees C. Chlorophyll a concentration per zooxanthellae cell showed an opposite trend as it was minimal at 18 degrees C and increased from 18 to 32 degrees C. Since the areal chlorophyll concentration is the product of the zooxanthellae density and its cellular content, these trends resulted in a homogeneous chlorophyll concentration per coral surface across temperature treatments. This confirms that B. europaea photosynthesis is progressively depressed at temperatures >21.6 degrees C, supporting previous hypotheses raised by the studies on growth and demography of this species. This study also confirms the threats posed to this species by the ongoing seawater warming.","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","English","Goffredo, S (Corresponding Author), Univ Bologna, Marine Sci Grp, Dept Biol Geol \& Environm Sci, Bologna, Italy.

Skeletal growth rate and delta(18)O are inversely related. We explain this in terms of McConnaughey's kinetic isotopic disequilibria model. Annual trends in delta(18)O cannot be solely explained by observed variations in seawater temperature or salinity and may also reflect seasonal variations in calcification rate. Coral tissue chlorophyll a content and delta(13)C of the underlying 1 mm of skeleton are positively related, suggesting that algal modification of the dissolved inorganic carbonate pool is the main control on skeletal delta(13)C. However, in corals that bleached during a period of exceptionally high seawater temperatures in the summer of 1991, delta(13)C of the outer 1 mm of skeleton and skeletal growth rate (over 9 months up to and including the bleaching event) are inversely related. Seasonal variations in delta(13)C may reflect variations in calcification rate, zooxanthellae photosynthesis or in seawater delta(13)C composition. Bleached corals had reduced calcification over the 9-month period up to and including the bleaching event and over the event they deposited carbonate enriched in C-13 and O-18 compared with unaffected corals. However, calcification during the event was limited and insufficient material was deposited to influence significantly the isotopic signature of the larger seasonal profile samples. In profile, overall decreases in delta(18)O and delta(13)C were observed, supporting evidence that positive temperature anomalies caused the bleaching event and reflecting the loss of zooxanthellae photosynthesis.","SPRINGER","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","English","UNIV EDINBURGH, GRANT INST GEOL, DEPT GEOL \& GEOPHYS, EDINBURGH EH9 3JW, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND.

In whole corals, O-2 production at 26 degrees C was significantly limited at C-i concentrations below ambient seawater (similar to 2.2 mM). Further additions of C-i up to similar to 10 mM caused no further stimulation of oxygenic photosynthesis. Following exposure to 30 degrees C (2 d), net oxygen production decreased significantly in whole corals, as a result of reduced production of photosynthetically derived oxygen rather than increased host consumption. Whole corals maintained a rate of oxygen evolution around eight times lower than cultured Symbiodinium sp. at inorganic carbon concentrations < 2 mM, but cultures displayed greater levels of photoinhibition following heat treatment (30 degrees C, 2 d). Whole corals and cultured zooxanthellae differed considerably in their responses to C-i concentration and moderate heat stress, demonstrating that cultured Symbiodinium make an incongruous model for those in hospite. Reduced net oxygen evolution, in whole corals, under conditions of low C-i (< 2 mM) has been interpreted in terms of possible sink limitation leading to increased nonphotochemical energy dissipation. The advantages of combined measurement of net gas exchange and fluorometry offered by this method are discussed.","WILEY","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","English","Ralph, P (Corresponding Author), Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Water \& Environm Resource Management, Dept Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.

Skeletal biometry, growth, and parameters of the solitary, zooxanthellate, Mediterranean endemic scleractinian Balanophyllia europaea were determined at depths of 1, 11, and 21 m in the Dardanelles (Turkey), to (1) compare the population parameters in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea with the well-characterized populations in the NW Mediterranean Sea, that are threatened by ocean warming and acidification; and (2) assess the variation of studied parameters along a depth gradient in the Dardanelles. Biometric relationships were similar to those previously described on Italian coasts. At shallow depths, average coral height decreased, likely because of (1) the higher current velocity and wave action that is expected to limit vertical skeletal growth and/or (2) the need to increase photoprotection in high light conditions. Only a very slight increase of skeletal bulk density with depth (and consequent slight decrease of porosity) was detected, while age-length relationship, linear extension rate and net calcification rate were homogeneous among depths. The homogeneous net calcification rate with depth may depend on the balance between the response of zooxanthellae photosynthesis to temperature and light. In fact, shallow depths are likely to experience higher temperatures that negatively affect photosynthetic efficiency of B. europaea, thus reducing available energy for calcification. On the other hand, lower light availability with depth is expected to decrease photosynthesis and these two effects may compensate each other. Unexpectedly, the observed net calcification rate in the Dardanelles was almost double than the higher value reported in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Further analyses are required to analyse if energetic trade-offs between skeletal growth and reproduction differ in the two regions.","SPRINGER","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","English","Ã–zalp, HB (Corresponding Author), Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Vocat Sch Ocean Engn, Sect Underwater Technol, Terzioglu Campus, TR-17020 Canakkale, Turkey.

One of these species, Symbiodinium muscatinei LaJeunesse et Trench, has a broad latitudinal distribution, occurring in intertidal anemones from Washington state to Southern California. To investigate whether high thermal tolerance contributes to the ability of S. muscatinei to inhabit anemones from northern and southern regions, the upper thermal tolerance limit for photosynthesis of symbionts in northern (48 degrees 24' N) populations of A. elegantissima was determined by subjecting anemones to a gradual increase in temperature from 12 degrees C to 30 degrees C over a 10-week period. Light-saturated photosynthetic rates of isolated zooxanthellae were the same over the range of 12 degrees C-24 degrees C and declined significantly at 26 degrees C, which is 14 degrees C and 5 degrees C above average summertime seawater temperatures in northern Puget Sound and Southern California, respectively. At 28 degrees C, zooxanthellae isolated from the anemones, and those expelled by their hosts, exhibited extremely low rates of photosynthesis and highly reduced chl content. The photosynthetic rates and chl content of expelled zooxanthellae were lower than those of retained zooxanthellae. The high thermal tolerance of S. muscatinei isolated from northern populations of anemones supports the broad latitudinal distribution of this symbiont, allowing it to coexist with S. californium (\#383, Banaszak et al. 1993) in southern populations of anemones.","BLACKWELL PUBLISHING","9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND","English","Muller-Parker, G (Corresponding Author), Western Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA.

High temperature and low irradiation reduced the algal tolerance against low salinity.

Results: Calcification rate was correlated with skeletal density but not with linear extension rate, indicating that calcium carbonate deposition was preferentially allocated to keep a constant skeletal density. Unlike most studies on both temperate and tropical zooxanthellate corals, where calcification rate is strongly related to environmental parameters such as SST, in the present study calcification rate was not correlated with SST. Conclusions: The lower sensitivity of L. pruvoti to SST with respect to other sympatric zooxanthellate corals, such as Balanophyllia europaea, may rely on the absence of a temperature induced inhibition of photosynthesis, and thus the absence of an inhibition of the calcification process. This study is the first field investigation of the relationship between SST and the three growth parameters of an azooxanthellate coral. Increasing research effort on determining the effects of temperature on biological traits of the poorly studied azooxanthellate scleractinians may help to predict the possible species assemblage shifts that are likely to occur in the immediate future as a consequence of global climatic change.","BMC","CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","English","Goffredo, S (Corresponding Author), Univ Bologna, Dept Biol Geol \& Environm Sci, Marine Sci Grp, Via F Selmi 3, I-40126 Bologna, EU, Italy.

This bleaching has frequently been attributed to photoinhibition of photosynthetic electron transport and the consequent photodamage to photosystem II (PSII) and the production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the zooxanthellae (Symbiodinium spp.). However, these events may be because of perturbations of other processes occurring within the zooxanthellae or the host cells, and consequently constitute only secondary responses to temperature increase. The processes involved with the onset of photoinhibition of electron transport, photodamage to PSII and pigment bleaching in coral zooxanthellae are reviewed. Consideration is given to how increases in temperature might lead to perturbations of metabolic processes in the zooxanthellae and/or their host cells, which could trigger events leading to bleaching. It is concluded that production of ROS by the thylakoid photosynthetic apparatus in the zooxanthellae plays a major role in the onset of bleaching resulting from photoinhibition of photosynthesis, although it is not clear which particular ROS are involved. It is suggested that hydrogen peroxide generated in the zooxanthellae may have a signalling role in triggering the mechanisms that result in expulsion of zooxanthellae from corals.","WILEY","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","English","Baker, NR (Corresponding Author), Univ Essex, Coral Reef Res Unit, Dept Biol Sci, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.

Nonetheless, studies simultaneously investigating the effects of warming on all holobiont members are lacking. Here we show that exposure to increased temperature affects key physiological traits of all members (herein: animal host, zooxanthellae and diazotrophs) of both Stylophora pistillata and Acropora hemprichii during and after thermal stress. S. pistillata experienced severe loss of zooxanthellae (i.e., bleaching) with no net photosynthesis at the end of the experiment. Conversely, A. hemprichii was more resilient to thermal stress. Exposure to increased temperature (+ 6 degrees C) resulted in a drastic increase in daylight dinitrogen (N-2) fixation, particularly in A. hemprichii (threefold compared with controls). After the temperature was reduced again to in situ levels, diazotrophs exhibited a reversed diel pattern of activity, with increased N-2 fixation rates recorded only in the dark, particularly in bleached S. pistillata (twofold compared to controls). Concurrently, both animal hosts, but particularly bleached S. pistillata, reduced both organic matter release and heterotrophic feeding on picoplankton. Our findings indicate that physiological plasticity by coral-associated diazotrophs may play an important role in determining the response of coral holobionts to ocean warming.","WILEY","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","English","Cardini, U (Corresponding Author), Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Ecol ZMT, Coral Reef Ecol Grp CORE, Fahrenheitstr 6, DE-28359 Bremen, Germany.

Coral bleaching is the disruption of the symbiotic association between coral hosts and their photosynthetic microalgae zooxanthellae. This is either due to lowered resistance in corals to infection or increased virulence of the bacterium at the higher sea surface temperature. The concentration of the oxygen and resulting oxygen radicals produced by the zooxanthellae during photosynthesis are highly toxic to bacteria, which also assist corals in resisting the infection. Hence, in this study we examined the effect of different temperatures on the activity of a novel extracellular SOD in V. shiloi. We also partially characterized the SOD and clearly confirmed that the extracellular SOD produced by V. shiloi is Mn-SOD type, as it was not inhibited by H2O2 or KCN. Performing chemical susceptibility killing assay, we confirmed that extracellular SOD may act as first line of defense for the bacteria against the reactive oxygen species. Since, increased activity of novel Mn-SOD at higher temperature, leads to the neutralization of radical toxicity and facilitates the survival of V. shiloi. Hence, the extracellular Mn-SOD may be considered as a virulence factor.","SPRINGER","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","English","Devaraj, SN (Corresponding Author), Univ Madras, Dept Biochem, Guindy Campus, Madras 600025, Tamil Nadu, India.

We therefore studied the separate and combined impacts of increases in temperature and pCO(2) on phosphate, ammonium, and nitrate uptake rates by the scleractinian coral S. pistillata. Three experiments were performed, during 10 days i) at three pHT conditions (8.1, 7.8, and 7.5) and normal temperature (26 degrees C), ii) at three temperature conditions (26 degrees, 29 degrees C, and 33 degrees C) and normal pH(T) (8.1), and iii) at three pH(T) conditions (8.1, 7.8, and 7.5) and elevated temperature (33 degrees C). After 10 days of incubation, corals had not bleached, as protein, chlorophyll, and zooxanthellae contents were the same in all treatments. However, photosynthetic rates significantly decreased at 33 degrees C, and were further reduced for the pH(T) 7.5. The photosynthetic efficiency of PSII was only decreased by elevated temperature. Nutrient uptake rates were not affected by a change in pH alone. Conversely, elevated temperature (33 degrees C) alone induced an increase in phosphate uptake but a severe decrease in nitrate and ammonium uptake rates, even leading to a release of nitrogen into seawater. Combination of high temperature (33 degrees C) and low pH(T) (7.5) resulted in a significant decrease in phosphate and nitrate uptake rates compared to control corals (26 degrees C, pH(T) = 8.1). These results indicate that both inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism may be negatively affected by the cumulative effects of ocean warming and acidification.","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","English","Godinot, C (Corresponding Author), Ctr Sci Monaco, Monaco, Monaco.

To characterize the physiological response of some common Mediterranean gorgonians to fluctuations in temperature, four species (Paramuricea clavata, Eunicella singularis, Eunicella cavolinii and Corallium rubrum) were maintained in aquaria, in which the temperature was increased every ten days with increments of 2-3 degrees C, starting at 14 degrees C, ending at 25 degrees C. Oxygen consumption, number of open/closed polyps and percentage of necrotic tissue were monitored. All species showed similar activity patterns with increasing temperature. P. clavata and E. singularis showed the highest respiration rate at 18 degrees C, E. cavolinii and C rubrum at 20 degrees C. Above these temperatures, both oxygen consumption and polyp reactivity decreased in all species. The present data confirm a reduction of the metabolic activity in Mediterranean gorgonians during periods of high temperature. At temperatures above 18 degrees C, the percentage of open polyps (considered as a parameter to evaluate polyps reactivity) decreased, thus mirroring the trend of oxygen consumption. The average values of Q(10) indicated that gorgonians have a definite temperature limit over which the metabolism (oxygen consumption) stop to follow the temperature increase. After three days at 25 degrees C, metabolic activity in E. cavolinii, C. rubrum and P. clavata further decreased and the first signs of necrosis were observed. At this temperature, activity remained unchanged in E. singularis. This species seems to more resistant to thermal stress. The symbiotic zooxanthellae present in this species are likely to provide an alternative source of energy when polyps reduce their feeding activity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The resulting curves of natural fluorescence of Chl a vs photosynthetically active radiation (PAR 400-700 nm) showed that: (1) natural fluorescence was limited by light availability in both deep and shallow colonies in all seasons; (2) photosynthesis occurred in C. caespitosa also in winter, when temperature is low and seawater turbidity contributes significantly to PAR attenuation; and (3) the efficiency of the Chl a fluorescence increased from summer to winter.

Photozoan associations tend to dominate tropical and subtropical waters, whereas heterozoan carbonate systems tend to occur in cooler waters and in localised areas that are affected by nutrient-rich upwelling or terrestrial runoff. Because of the wide climatic spectrum in which heterozoan carbonates are found, their interpretation is often problematic. We present a high-resolution analysis of the Attard Member of the Lower Coralline Limestone Formation (Upper Oligocene, Malta). The biotic associations and palaeolatitudinal reconstructions suggest that carbonate sedimentation took place in tropical waters under oligotrophic conditions. An important factor controlling the spread of heterozoan assemblages in the Late Oligocene of Malta seems to be related to the palaeoecology and evolution of zooxanthellate. The limited capacity of corals to thrive in high-light conditions and to form a wave-resistant reef promoted the diffusion of heterozoan assemblages. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To evaluate the effects of predicted elevated seawater temperatures on coral recruitment, larvae from the coral Porites astreoides were exposed to seawater at ambient (27.3 A degrees C) or elevated temperature (30.8 A degrees C) conditions for 4, 24, or 48 h. Following exposure, larvae were tested for survival and settlement, oxidative stress, respiratory demand, and mRNA expression of heat-shock proteins (Hsps) 16 and 60. While elevated temperature had no effect on larval survival, settlement, or expression of Hsps, it did cause a significant increase in larval respiration, oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation), and antioxidant enzyme activity (catalase). The absence of a significant up-regulation of Hsp 16 or 60 expression in response to thermal stress suggests that the transcriptional expression of these genes is a less sensitive diagnostic tool compared to biomarkers of oxidative stress at the temperatures examined. The results of this study provide evidence that enhanced levels of oxidative stress are encountered in zooxanthellae-containing coral larvae in response to elevated temperatures and that this occurrence should be strongly considered for use as a biomarker when monitoring sub-lethal cellular responses to rising sea surface temperatures.","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","English","Ross, C (Corresponding Author), Univ N Florida, Dept Biol, 1 UNF Dr, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA.

Zooxanthellae within M. annularis and A. lamarki were found to be more sensitive to elevated temperature, virtually complete disruption of photosynthesis being noted during exposure to temperatures of 32 and 34 degrees C. The photosynthetic efficiency of zooxanthellae within S. radians and A. agaricites decreased to a lesser extent, Differences in the loss of algal cells on an aerial basis and in the cellular chlorophyll concentration were also found between these species. By combining the noninvasive PAM technique with whole-cell fluorescence of freshly isolated zooxanthellae, we have identified fundamental differences in the physiology of the symbionts within different species of coral. Zooxanthellae within M. annularis appear to be more susceptible to heat-induced damage at or near the reaction centre of Photosystem II, while zooxanthellae living in S. radians remain capable of dissipating excess excitation energy through non-photochemical pathways, thereby protecting the photosystem from damage during heat exposure.","WILEY","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","English","Warner, ME (Corresponding Author), UNIV GEORGIA, INST ECOL, ATHENS, GA 30602 USA.

However, the accuracy of paleoSSTs derived from fossil coral Sr/Ca is challenged by evidence that physiological processes influence skeletal chemistry. Here we show that water level variations from tidal forcing are correlated with changes in coral Sr/Ca that cannot be accounted for by changes in SST. Ion microprobe measurements of Sr/Ca ratios in a Pacific Porites lutea reveal high-frequency variations at periods of similar to6, similar to10, and similar to25 days. The relationship between Sr/Ca and temperature on these short timescales does not follow trends observed at longer periods, indicating that an additional forcing is required to explain our observations. We demonstrate that Sr/Ca is correlated with both tidal water level variations and SST, and that their contributions to the Sr/Ca content of the skeleton vary as a function of period. We propose that water level influences Sr/Ca indirectly via modulation of photosynthetically-active radiation (PAR) that drives large changes in zooxanthellate photosynthesis.","AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION","2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA","English","Cohen, AL (Corresponding Author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol \& Geophys, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.

Although coral calcification is supported by high seawater pH, photosynthesis by the algal symbionts of zooxanthellate corals can be promoted by elevated pCO(2). To investigate the mechanisms underlying corals' complex responses to global change, three species of tropical zooxanthellate corals (Stylophora pistillata, Pocillopora damicornis, and Seriatopora hystrix) and one species of asymbiotic cold-water coral (Desmophyllum pertusum, syn. Lophelia pertusa) were cultured under a range of ocean acidification and warming scenarios. Under control temperatures, all tropical species exhibited increased calcification rates in response to increasing pCO(2). However, the tropical species' response to increasing pCO(2) flattened when they lost symbionts (i.e., bleached) under the high-temperature treatments-suggesting that the loss of symbionts neutralized the benefit of increased pCO(2) on calcification rate. Notably, the cold-water species that lacks symbionts exhibited a negative calcification response to increasing pCO(2), although this negative response was partially ameliorated under elevated temperature. All four species elevated their calcifying fluid pH relative to seawater pH under all pCO(2) treatments, and the magnitude of this offset (Delta{[}H+]) increased with increasing pCO(2). Furthermore, calcifying fluid pH decreased along with symbiont abundance under thermal stress for the one species in which calcifying fluid pH was measured under both temperature treatments. This observation suggests a mechanistic link between photosymbiont loss ('bleaching') and impairment of zooxanthellate corals' ability to elevate calcifying fluid pH in support of calcification under heat stress. This study supports the assertion that thermally induced loss of photosymbionts impairs tropical zooxanthellate corals' ability to cope with CO2-induced ocean acidification.","MDPI","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","English","Ries, JB (Corresponding Author), Northeastern Univ, Dept Marine \& Environm Sci, Nahant, MA 01908 USA.

Growth of these injured nubbins was examined in parallel, and compared to controls. Biochemical compositions of the holobiont and the zooxanthellae density were determined at the onset of the experiment, and the photosynthetic efficiency (F-v/F-m) of zooxanthellae was monitored during the experiment. Acropora muricata rapidly regenerated small lesions, but regeneration rates significantly differed between sites. At the sheltered site characterized by high temperatures, temperature variations, and irradiance levels, regeneration took 192 days on average. At the exposed site, characterized by steadier temperatures and lower irradiation, nubbins demonstrated fast lesion repair (81 days), slower growth, lower zooxanthellae density, chlorophyll a concentration and lipid content than at the former site. A trade-off between growth and regeneration rates was evident here. High growth rates seem to impair regeneration capacity. We show that environmental conditions conducive to high zooxanthellae densities in corals are related to fast skeletal growth but also to reduced lesion regeneration rates. We hypothesize that a lowered regenerative capacity may be related to limited availability of energetic and cellular resources, consequences of coral holobionts operating at high levels of photosynthesis and associated growth.","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","English","Denis, V (Corresponding Author), Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Coral Lab, Taipei 115, Taiwan.

The link between coral Sr/Ca and SST is not well-understood and there have been a number of discrepant observations {[}de Villiers et al., 1995; Alibert, 1998]. Corals with symbiotic zooxanthellae are known to show large diurnal fluctuations in calcification rate associated with the photosynthetic activity of their symbionts. Using detailed measurements with the ion microprobe, we compared the Sr/Ca content of discrete daytime and nighttime skeletal structures in the massive hermatypic coral Porites lutea over the course of 1 year and a seasonal temperature range of 4 degreesC. The Sr/Ca content of daytime skeleton is always lower than that of adjacent nighttime skeleton. While the slope of the nighttime Sr/Ca-SST correlation is close to that seen in inorganic aragonite precipitates, that of the daytime correlation is >4 times as steep. We attribute these differences to the role of photosynthesis in calcification and conclude that bulk Sr/Ca is related principally to daytime calcification rate rather than directly to SST. More reliable estimates of past SST may be arrived at through selective analysis of nighttime skeleton.","AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION","2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA","English","Cohen, AL (Corresponding Author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol \& Geophys, 266 Woods Hole Rd, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.

When the temperature exceeds the tolerant limit of a coral-zooxanthellae holobiont, it induces physiological stress and disrupts the vulnerable fine-tuned balance between the two partners, leading to bleaching. The gene expression profiles of a scleractinian coral and its symbiotic zooxanthellae can offer important information with which to decipher this balanced relationship at the functional level of genes. Here, we sequence a full-length transcriptome of a well-known, common and frequently dominant reef-building coral, Pocillopora damicornis, to acquire gene expression information for the coral-zooxanthellae holobiont. To this end, we identify 21,926 and 465 unique genes in the coral and algal symbiont, respectively, and examine the functional enrichment among these genes based on GO (gene ontology) terms and KEGG (the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways. The results show that the zooxanthellae provide for their coral host through energy and nutrition metabolism by photosynthesis, and that both the coral host and zooxanthellae have an anti-stress molecular mechanism, though the two parties have independent abilities to survive in the short term. This work sheds light on the valuable gene expression profile of a coral-zooxanthellae holobiont and provides grounds for further molecular biological research to support ecological protection work.","MDPI","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","English","He, CP; Lu, ZH (Corresponding Author), Southeast Univ, Sch Biol Sci \& Med Engn, State Key Lab Bioelect, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China.

To improve our understanding of stable strontium isotope fractionation during the biomineralization process, correlations between monthly coral skeletal delta Sr-88 values and climatic and environmental variables (along with their corresponding geochemical proxies) between 2008 and 2009 were studied using a massive zooxanthellae Porites coral head from Sanya Bay on the south coast of Hainan Island in the northern South China Sea. Sea surface temperature and its corresponding geochemical proxies (Sr/Ca and delta O-18), pH and its proxy delta B-11, and precipitation (representing river runoff) show clear annual cycles, but their correlations with coral delta Sr-88 were not significant during 2008 and 2009. However, both total solar irradiance (TSI) and coral delta Sr-88 values followed a gradually increasing trend over the study period and showed a statistically significant correlation. These results indicate that the fractionation associated with coral skeleton delta Sr-88 is not temperature-dependent, but TSI may play a major role in controlling coral delta Sr-88 values at our study site. The underlying mechanism of TSI-induced Sr-88/Sr-86 fractionation in coral skeletons may be similar to that associated with coral delta C-13. That is, symbiotic zooxanthellae preferentially uptakes Sr-86 during photosynthesis leaving the internal strontium reservoirs enriched in Sr-88; consequently, increased uptake of Sr-88 by the coral skeleton occurs when photosynthetic rates increase. However, the correlation between coral delta Sr-88 and delta C-13 values may be masked by the carbon input from terrestrial river runoff and the kinetic isotope fractionation effect during the calcification process.","ELSEVIER","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","English","Deng, WF (Corresponding Author), Chinese Acad Sci, Guangzhou Inst Geochem, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China.

Here, we summarize the current knowledge on the diversity of zooxanthellate jellyfishes, to identify key traits of the holobionts, and to examine the impact of these traits on their ecology. Photosymbiosis with zooxanthellae originated at least seven times independently in Medusozoa; of these, five involve taxa with medusae. While most zooxanthellate jellyfishes are found in clades containing mainly non-zooxanthellate members, the sub-order Kolpophorae (Scyphozoa: Rhizostomeae) is comprised-bar a few intriguing exceptions-of only zooxanthellate jellyfishes. We estimate that 20-25\% of Scyphozoa species are zooxanthellate (facultative symbiotic species included). Zooxanthellae play a key role in scyphozoan life-cycle and nutrition although substantial variation is observed during ontogeny, or at the intra- and inter-specific levels. Nonetheless, three key traits of zooxanthellate jellyfishes can be identified: (1) zooxanthellate medusae, as holobionts, are generally mixotrophic, deriving their nutrition both from predation and photosynthesis; (2) zooxanthellate polyps, although capable of hosting zooxanthellae rarely depend on them; and (3) zooxanthellae play a key role in the life-cycle of the jellyfish by allowing or facilitating strobilation. We discuss how these traits might help to explain some aspects of the ecology of zooxanthellate jellyfishes-notably their generally low ability to outbreak, and their reaction to temperature stress or to eutrophication-and how they could in turn impact marine ecosystem functioning.","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","English","Djeghri, N (Corresponding Author), Univ Brest, Inst Univ Europeen Mer, IUEM UBO, Lab Sci Environm Marin,LEMAR,UMR 6539, Technopole Brest Iroise,Rue Dumont dUrville, F-29280 Plouzane, France.

Exposure of Stylophora pistillata to 33 and 34 degrees C for 4 h resulted in (1) the development of strong non-photochemical quenching (qN) of the chlorophyll fluorescence signal, (2) marked decreases in photosynthetic oxygen evolution, and (3) decreases in optimal quantum yield (F-v/F-m) of photosystern II (PSII), Quantum yield decreased to a greater extent on the illuminated surfaces of coral branches than on lower (shaded) surfaces, and also when high irradiance intensities were combined with elevated temperature (33 degrees C as opposed to 28 degrees C), qN collapsed in heat-stressed samples when quenching analysis was conducted in the absence of oxygen, Collectively, these observations are interpreted as the initiation of photoprotective dissipation of excess absorbed energy as heat (qN) and O-2-dependent electron flow through the Mehler-Ascorbate-Peroxidase cycle (MAP-cycle) following the point at which the rate of light-driven electron transport exceeds the capacity of the Calvin cycle. A model for coral bleaching is proposed whereby the primary site of heat damage in S, pistillata is carboxylation within the Calvin cycle, as has been observed during heat damage in higher plants, Damage to PSII and a reduction in F-v/F-m (i.e. photoinhibition) are secondary effects following the overwhelming of photoprotective mechanisms by light. This secondary factor increases the effect of the primary variable, temperature. Potential restrictions of electron flow in heat-stressed zooxanthellae are discussed with respect to Calvin cycle enzymes and the unusual status of the dinoflagellate Rubisco, Significant features of our model are that (1) damage to PSII is not the initial step in the sequence of heat stress in zooxanthellae, acid (2) light plays a key secondary role in the initiation of the bleaching phenomena.","WILEY","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","English","Hoegh-Guldberg, O (Corresponding Author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.

Until now, the method has only been applied in homogeneous phytoplankton cultures and field samples. Corals are among the world's most productive ecosystems because they host symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae) that provide them with a large amount of photosynthates for their energy requirements. Coral reefs face unprecedented pressures on local, regional, and global scales due to climate change and anthropogenic disturbances. Responses to such stress are often a decrease in the photosynthetic efficiency of the symbiotic dinoflagellates, as well as bleaching, which involves the mass expulsion of these symbionts or loss of their pigments. Photosynthesis is a sensitive indicator of stress in plants and plays a central role in the nutrition of symbiotic invertebrates. Our aim was to examine the applicability of photoacoustics, developed by us for ecological work with phytoplankton, to the study of symbiotic dinoflagellates in situ. We have determined areal chlorophyll content and light energy storage efficiency with three zooxanthellate coelenterates, two corals and one hydrozoan, hosting symbiotic algae. We also present the effect of temperature elevation on the decrease in photosynthetic efficiency of the symbiotic coral Stylophora pistillata determined by photoacoustics. Our results demonstrate the potential, power, and convenience of photoacoustics in following bleaching-related changes in coral pigmentation, in the photosynthetic energy storage efficiency of corals, and in its usefulness in diagnosing its health in relation to environmental factors, in the example presented here, seawater warming.","AMER SOC LIMNOLOGY OCEANOGRAPHY","5400 BOSQUE BLVD, STE 680, WACO, TX 76710-4446 USA","English","Pinchasov-Grinblat, Y (Corresponding Author), Bar Ilan Univ, Mina \& Everard Goodman Fac Life Sci, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel.

This is particularly relevant for tropical organisms living close to their thermal optimum, well exemplified by the increasing fre-quency of bleaching occurrence in shallow-water corals. Mesophotic Coral Ecosystems (MCEs) were suggested as potential oases, especially when they are submitted to internal waves inducing short-term cooling events. Indeed, probability of bleaching occurrence in scleractinians was reported to decrease with depth in Mo'orea as tem-perature variability increases. However, ecophysiological data are currently lacking to understand the cause of lower susceptibility/increased plasticity of deeper corals. A growing interest has been devoted the last decade to MCEs, but our understanding of the physiological performance of benthic organisms living in this environment remains relatively unexplored. To tackle that question, we first compared the metabolic responses (dark respi-ration, net photosynthesis and photosynthetic efficiency) of the depth-generalist scleractinian Pachyseris speciosa from two heterogeneous thermal environment (25 and 85 m depths) to acute heat stress to determine if the local thermal environment could predict coral response to warming. Then, we tested the thermal performance of two sympatric species (the scleractinian P. speciosa and the antipatharian Stichopathes sp.) to determine if there are inter-species differences in performances in species experiencing identical levels of temperature variability, at mesophotic depths (85 m). Results revealed broader thermal performances in the mesophotic P. speciosa compared to mid-depth ones, and constrained performances in the mesophotic antipatharian compared to the scleractinian species. We hypothesize that the high fluctuations in temperature due to internal waves in deeper areas contribute to the broader thermal performances of mesophotic P. speciosa. However, the constrained performances of the mesophotic antipatharian compared to P. speciosa suggests that other processes than the symbiosis with zooxanthellae also influence thermal performances of these mesophotic organisms. Our results supported that Stichopathes sp. lives close to its thermal optimum, suggesting a (relatively) cold thermal specialist strategy. In this context, composition of MCEs in the future is unlikely to shift to antipatharian-dominated landscape and will remain coral-dominated landscape.","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","English","Godefroid, M (Corresponding Author), Univ Libre Bruxelles, Ave FD Roosevelt 50,CP160-15, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.

The presence of a calcium pump in corals has been confirmed and its temperature related breakdown underlies coral bleaching. There is also mounting evidence from stable calcium isotope ratios in the skeleton for involvement of a calcium pump in coral calcification. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is known to be generated by zooxanthellae during photosynthesis and passes easily through cell membranes. H2O2 is known to cause lipid peroxidation of the plasma membrane and make it leaky to Call. In this study lipid peroxidation was measured in the tissues of Agaricia agaricites. Lipid peroxides in the light doubled from 5.83 to 11.23 mu Mol.cm(-2) (n=17) over the first 3-4 hours then slowly decreased over the next four hours. Glutathione, which in many organisms acts as a lipid peroxidation repair system, was also found at a mean level of 79 mu g.cm(-2) (n = 14) and probably accounts for the observed reduction of lipid peroxide levels. It is suggested that the lipid peroxidation makes the plasma membrane leaky to Ca2+ and thus provides a route by which Ca2+ enters cells of the calicoblastic layer. A model of calcification, following Adkins et al (2003), is presented in which calcification takes place from the extracellular calcifying fluid (ECF) between the calicoblastic layer and the skeleton. The Ca-ATPase calcium pump drives calcification by actively transporting Call into the ECF and setting up pH and carbon dioxide (CO2) gradients that enhance the passive diffusion of CO2 and the formation of calcium carbonate. It is suggested that, in light, H2O2 produced by zooxanthellae makes the membranes leaky to Ca2+. The calcium pump has to work harder to maintain low internal levels of calcium and thus more Call would be actively transported into the ECF to be deposited as calcium carbonate. Rev. Biol.

To explore the relationship between calcification and pH, small pieces of coral were suspended from a torsion microbalance in gently stirred, temperature controlled, seawater in a closed chamber. Net calcification rate and pH were continuously monitored while light, temperature or pH could be manipulated. The coral pieces were from the edges of thin plates of Agaricia agaricites and were studied alive and freshly collected. Unexpectedly, when calcification was taking place (n=9, 0.082 mg.hr(-1).cm(-2)), as determined by weight increase, the pH of the surrounding seawater medium changed little (n=10, -0.0047 pH units.hr(-1).cm(-2)). When calcification was not taking place the decrease of seawater pH was an order of magnitude higher, -0.013 pH units.hr(-1).cm(-2). This is the opposite of what is expected when calcium carbonate (CaCO3) forms. Similarly, fresh skeleton initially showed no change of pH in the seawater medium although the rates of weight gain were high (upto 1.0 mg hr(-1).cm(-2)). After 10 hours, as the rate of deposition decreased following a generalized Michaelis-Menten growth curve, the pH began to decrease dramatically indicating an increase of CO2 in the seawater. These unexpected results can be explained if unstable calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO3)(2)) is formed in the organic matrix/carbonic anhydrase surface and slowly transforms later to CaCO3. Pieces of living coral monitored in the chamber for 30 hours gained weight during the day and loss it at night. The loss would be consistent with the transformation of Ca(HCO3)(2) to CaCO3 with the release of CO2. The mean calcification rate of live coral was greater (n=8, p=0.0027) in high light (120 mu mol.s(-1).m(-2)) at 0.098 mg.hr(-1).cm(-2), compared to 0.063 mg.hr(-1).cm(-2) in low light (12 mu mol.s(-1).m(-2)). However, at the same time the mean rate of pH change was -0.0076 under low light compared to -0.0030 under high light (n=8, p=0.0001). The difference can be explained by CO2 being used for photosynthesis by zooxanthellae. The deposition rate of live coral was not affected by the addition of phosphate but the rate of weight gain by the freshly collected skeleton was strongly enhanced by phosphate. These results indicate that care should be applied in the application of the alkalinity anomaly technique for the measurement of calcification in corals.","REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL","UNIVERSIDAD DE COSTA RICA CIUDAD UNIVERSITARIA, SAN JOSE, 00000, COSTA RICA","English","Sandeman, IM (Corresponding Author), Trent Univ, Dept Biol, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada.

However, whether it has occurred in the past in times of thermal stress remains unclear. Moreover, an understanding of historic coral bleaching events would greatly improve our insight into the adaptive capabilities of corals under such stresses. It is known that Porites corals, a massive coral, have relatively high levels of symbiotic zooxanthellae and a strong thermal tolerance when compared with most other corals (and particularly branched corals). Thus, growth hiatuses and/or mortality surfaces of fossil Porites may be used to indicate past ecological or environmental stress events, such as severe bleaching. In this study, monthly geochemical and isotopic environmental proxies of four fossil Porites corals with well-preserved growth hiatuses and mortality surfaces (aged 3,800-4,200years before 2013A.D.), collected from Wenchang fringing reef, Hainan Island, Northern South China Sea were analyzed. Specifically, the Sr/Ca, O-18, and C-13 were measured with a monthly resolution for each sample. These environmental proxies were used to reconstruct the sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), and physiological activity of the coral at the time when the growth hiatuses and/or mortality surfaces occurred. These data were subsequently used to determine the causes of coral mortality and growth discontinuity in each case. The results show that growth hiatuses and mortalities mainly occurred in summer, with high SST (31-34 degrees C) and SSS (32.8-38.4). In addition, abrupt negative shifts of 2-3 in C-13 were observed in almost all of the surfaces of growth hiatus and mortality, indicating a dramatically reduced level of photosynthetic activity in symbiotic zooxanthellae. Because of the above reasons, we conclude that the frequently observed mortality and growth discontinuity of Porites corals from the mid-Holocene is evidence for thermal bleaching events in the past. That is, coral bleaching has occurred 3,800-4,200years ago and is not a new phenomenon. Plain Language Summary We carried out this pilot study to explore the possible response of coral to generally warm conditions in prehistoric periods. Four massive Porites coral fossils that died 3800-4200 years ago were collected from the Wenchang fringing reef, Hainan Island, Northern South China Sea. Our research shows that mortalities of Porites corals frequently occurred and they were caused by dramatically reduced photosynthesis activity of symbiotic zooxanthellae under the stresses of high thermal and saline conditions. The death of Porites corals means the occurrence of coral bleaching. The proof of thermal bleaching in the mid-Holocene indicates that coral bleaching events are not a new ecological phenomena and it may be a recurrent natural phenomenon.","AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION","2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA","English","Yu, KF (Corresponding Author), Guangxi Univ, Coral Reef Res Ctr China, Nanning, Peoples R China.

The different levels of emphasis are the coral animal and the reef community. The main study area is the Red Sea which reaches over 20 degrees latitude up to the northernmost margin of the global coral reef belt. Supplementary results on microborer ecology are provided from the Bahamas. The desert enclosed Red Sea, not influenced by land runoff and only minimally by anthropogenic (urban and touristic) nutrient inputs, is predestined for a study on the principal influence of light on calcification within bathymetrical and latitudinal gradients. Hence, on the level of the zooxanthellate scleractinian animal phototrophic and heterotrophic energy supply and its bearing on calcification are being measured in different coral species - in particular in Porites sp., one of the most important reef builders. The growth of 15 zooxanthellate scleractinians in the Gulf of Aqaba correlates with the annual light cycle. This correlation is observable down to 40 m depth. Other growth promoting factors seem to have less influence on coral extension. The availability of organically enriched sediments in shallow water probably yields nutritional value, in particular for filter feeding species, thus restricting their distribution to those areas. Zooxanthellae, when isolated from Mycedium elephantotus, are different in their dependence on depth in maximum rates of photosynthesis and photosynthetic efficiency ( -slope). Increasing concentrations of pigments as a function of depth could be determined. Maximum rates of photosynthesis of zooxanthellae in vivo, collected at corresponding depth, have been 4 times higher. Structural and physiological adaptations improving heterotrophic and phototrophic energy intake are highlighted. Porites sp. was the subject of annual growth studies at locations extending from Aqaba in the North over the northern and southern Egyptian coast and islands, Sanganeb Atoll and Wingate reef offshore Sudan to the Gulf of Tadjoura in the Gulf of Aden (Djibouti). Mean growth rates in the shallow water zone increase with decreasing latitude and are highest at the southernmost studied reefs in the Gulf of Tadjoura. However, the observed latitudinal growth reduction is restricted to the upper ca. 15 m of the water column. The upper limit of growth potential decreases with depth parallel to the decrease of light availability. Highest growth rates are recorded in shallow depth (10-12.9 mm yr(-1)). This zone reaches at Aqaba (29 degrees 30'N) to a depth of ca. 10 m. At the southern Egyptian reefs (24 degrees 30'N) this zone extends to ca. 15 m water depth. This effect is probably a result of the stronger reduction of winter light levels and water temperature in the northern regions. Compared to other oceans the decrease of growth with increasing latitude of Red Sea Porites corals is far less, and growth rates at Aqaba are the highest observed at these latitudes. On the level of the community of reef inhabitants four principal topics are addressed: The first one is the dynamics of the proportions of hermatypic and ahermatypic organisms and open space. The occurrence of stony and soft corals and the sharing of empty space in different reef sections at Aqaba and on Sanganeb Atoll were quantified. Soft corals, mainly Sinularia- and xeniid species, occupy decreasing shares with depth. Among the Xenia species a bathymetrical zonation pattern was detected. The next issue is the growth impeding role of soft corals and gastropod parasites and predators on scleractinians. Experimental and field observations showed xeniid soft corals to be opportunistic i.e. occupying rapidly open space rather than to attacking and outcompeting stony corals. An increasingly specialized behaviour was detected among corallivorous gastropods of the family Corallophilidae to exploit their coral hosts. Whereas these snails are more or less sessile and depend for a long time on the surrounding host polyps the mobile Drupella cornus (Thaididae) forms feeding aggregations which denude mainly branching corals on shallow reef parts. Furthermore, the role counteracting reef growth of macro- and microbioeroders is investigated. Diadema setosum is a major destructive agent on reefs at Aqaba (not in the central Red Sea). The grazing sea urchins do not only keep potential colonization area free but also erode carbonate material (e. g. 1468 g/m(2)/year, 10 m depth). Demographic and bathymetric patterns in the sea urchin population are analyzed including their bearing on bioerosion of the reef. Investigations on microboring organisms in carbonate material have started in the Red Sea; initial results, however, are only available from similar studies near Lee Stocking island, Bahamas. Three major environments have been identified based on the distribution of the different microborers. These are 1) the intertidal environment dominated by boring cyanobacteria, 2) reef sites from 2 to 30 m water depth dominated by a diverse assemblage of boring cyanobacteria and chlorophytes, and 3) the deep reef slope from 100 to 300 m dominated by boring green algae and heterotrophs. The boring chlorophyte genus Phaeophila appears rapidly and dominates at sites from 2 to 30 m, but it leaves vacated borings and is replaced by Ostreobium quekettii after 1 year. Different substrate types show very different rates of colonization by microborers. The greatest excavation rates (100 g /m(2)/3 months) occur in fine-grained limestone, while the slowest rates (0.5 g/m(2)/3 months) occur in calcite crystals. Molluscan shell material shows intermediate rates of excavation. Light conditions appear very important in determining the growth rate and distribution of different microborers between the sites, however, the interaction of light with other factors, such as substrate, time period of exposure, and water quality conditions may be involved.","INSTITUT PALAONTOLOGIE UNIVERSITAT ERLANGEN-NURNBERG","LOEWENICHSTRABE 20, D-91054 ERLANGEN, GERMANY","English","SCHUHMACHER, H (Corresponding Author), UNIV ESSEN GESAMTHSCH,INST OKOL,HYDROBIOL ABT,POSTFACH 103764,D-45117 ESSEN,GERMANY.

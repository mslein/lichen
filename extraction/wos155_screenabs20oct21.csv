The lichens had various morphologies and represented seven photobiont and 41 mycobiont genera. Chl a, chitin and ergosterol were used as indirect markers of photobiont activity, fungal biomass and fungal respiration, respectively. The lichens were divided into three groups according to photobiont: (1) species with green algae, (2) species with cyanobacteria, and (3) tripartite species with green algal photobionts and cyanobacteria in cephalodia. Across species, thallus N concentration ranged from 1 to 50 mg g(-1) dry wt., NP varied 50-fold, and R 10-fold. In average, green algal lichens had the lowest, cyanobacterial Nostoc lichens the highest and tripartite lichens intermediate N concentrations. All three markers increased with thallus N concentration, and lichens with the highest Chl a and N concentrations had the highest rates of both P and R. Chl a alone accounted for ca. 30\% of variation in NP and R across species. On average, the photosynthetic efficiency quotient {[}K-F=(NPmax+R)/R)] ranged from 2.4 to 8.6, being higher in fruticose green algal lichens than in foliose Nostoc lichens. The former group invested more N in Chl a and this trait increased NPmax while decreasing R. In general terms, the investigated lichens invested N resources such that their maximal C input capacity matched their respiratory C demand around a similar (positive) equilibrium across species. However, it is not clear how this apparent optimisation of resource use is regulated in these symbiotic organisms.",10.1007/s00442-002-1019-0,0029-8549,1432-1939,WOS:000179035500004,"SANCHO, LEOPOLDO G/G-9120-2015 Valladares, Fernando/K-9406-2014 Palmqvist, Kristin/D-5589-2016 Sancho, leopoldo G./H-2974-2013 ","SANCHO, LEOPOLDO G/0000-0002-4751-7475 Valladares, Fernando/0000-0002-5374-4682 Palmqvist, Kristin/0000-0002-3923-1338 Mattsson, Jan-Eric/0000-0002-2737-5502",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,selected,likely not relevant,y,y?,maybe figure 2+3 -- but the x axis doesnÕt make a ton of sense,,

C. convoluta, for example, had maximal DR at 5 degreesC of - 0.42, - 1.11 and - 0.09 nmol CO2 g(-1) s(-1) in autumn, winter, and summer, respectively, a tenfold range. However, at the mean night temperatures for the same three seasons, 9.7 degreesC, 4.2 degreesC and 13.6 degreesC, maximal DR were almost identical at - 1.11, - 0.93, and - 1.45 nmol CO2 g(-1) s(-1). The information was extracted from measurements using automatic cuvettes that continuously recorded a sample lichen's gas exchange every 30 min under near-natural conditions. The longest period ( for L. muralis) covered 15 months and 22,000 data sets whilst, for the other species studied, data blocks were available throughout the calendar year. The acclimation of DR means that maximal net carbon fixation rates remain substantially similar throughout the year and are not depressed by increased carbon loss by respiration in warmer seasons. This is especially important for lichens because of their normally high rate of DR compared to net photosynthesis. We suggest that lichens, especially soil-crust species, could be a suitable model for fungi generally, a group of organisms for which little is known about temperature acclimation because of the great difficulty in separating the organism from its growth medium. Fungi, whether saprophytic, symbiotic or parasitic, including soil lichens, are important components of soil ecosystems and contribute much of the respired CO2 from these systems. Temperature acclimation by fungi would mean that expected increases in carbon losses caused by global climate warming from soil ecosystems might not be as extensive as first thought. This would ameliorate this positive feedback loop present in some climate models and might substantially lower the predicted warming.",10.1007/s00442-004-1697-x,0029-8549,1432-1939,WOS:000225472100002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,selected,seems maybe relevant?,y,y,figure 2,y,"tons of natural datapoints, maybe go back and extract from fig3,4,5 if natural conditions are relevant?"

It is found that the respiration of foliose lichens is more intensive than the respiration of fruticose lichens. The O-2 uptake rate correlates positively with the nitrogen content in the biomass of thalli and depends on temperature. The thalli O-2 uptake rate increased 2.2-2.4 times with a temperature increase from 5 to 15 degrees C. The reaction of respiration upon a further rise in temperature is species-specific. The decrease in the temperature coefficient of respiration (Q(10)) with a temperature increase to 35 degrees C is most pronounced in the endemic species Usnea aurantiaco-atra, which is well-adapted to Antarctic conditions.

Such changes may demand a high physiological plasticity of the local lichen species to maintain their role as key drivers in this pristine habitat. This study examines the response of net photosynthesis and respiration to increasing temperatures for three Antarctic lichen species with different ecological response amplitudes. We hypothesize that negative effects caused by increased temperatures can be mitigated by thermal acclimation of respiration and/or photosynthesis. The fully controlled growth chamber experiment simulated intermediate and extreme temperature increases over the time course of 6 weeks. Results showed that, in contrast to our hypothesis, none of the species was able to down-regulate temperature-driven respiratory losses through thermal acclimation of respiration. Instead, severe effects on photobiont vitality demonstrated that temperatures around 15 degrees C mark the upper limit for the two species restricted to the Antarctic, and when mycobiont demands exceeded the photobiont capacity they could not survive within the lichen thallus. In contrast, the widespread lichen species was able to recover its homoeostasis by rapidly increasing net photosynthesis. We conclude that to understand the complete lichen response, acclimation processes of both symbionts, the photo- and the mycobiont, have to be evaluated separately. As a result, we postulate that any acclimation processes in lichen are species-specific. This, together with the high degree of response variability and sensitivity to temperature in different species that co-occur spatially close, complicates any predictions regarding future community composition in the Antarctic.

Respiration in eight lichen species was related to thallus hydration status, external temperature and to total nitrogen, chitin and ergosterol concentrations. Chitin is a nitrogenous and major compound of the fungal cell wall, and ergosterol is a sterol of the plasma membrane in fungi and sometimes in algae. 2. Hydration of previously dry thalli resulted in an initially high rate of respiration. Both the amplitude of this resaturation respiration and the time required to reach steady state varied among species. Generally, peak rates were one to three times higher than steady-state rates, which were reached 3-7 h after hydration, 3. Increases in external temperature also resulted in transient bursts in respiration. Again, both the amplitude of the burst and the time required to reach steady state varied among species. Also depending on species, a temperature increase from 5 to 15 degrees C resulted in two- to fivefold increases in steady-state respiration. 4. Steady-state respiration, at optimal thallus hydration and a given temperature, varied three- to sixfold among the species, when related to thallus dry mass. This difference correlated best (r(2) = 0.89) with their ergosterol concentration, where a doubling in ergosterol resulted in more than a doubling in respiration. Respiration correlated less well to total nitrogen or chitin. 5. The chitin to ergosterol ratio varied more than one order of magnitude between the species, where species with high nitrogen concentrations had the highest ratio.

Carbon dioxide gas exchange measurements revealed that net photosynthesis and dark respiration occurred at subzero temperatures regardless of whether a lichen thallus saturated with liquid water was exposed to subzero temperatures, or if a dry thallus was re-hydrated only from snow at subzero temperatures. When water-saturated thalli of U. aprina were slowly cooled at subzero temperatures ice nucleation activity could be detected at -5.4 degrees C, indicating extracellular freezing of water. Using low-temperature scanning electron microscopy (LTSEM) it was demonstrated that extracellular ice formation leads to cytorrhysis in the photobiont cells and to cavitation in the mycobiont cells. Both processes were reversible if the lichen thallus was re-warmed. When dry lichen thalli were covered with snow at subzero temperatures a substantial re-hydration from snow could be observed in LTSEM micrographs and measured gravimetrically. The final thallus water content was strongly dependent on the temperature regime and gave water contents between 20\% d. wt at -21 degrees C and 56\% d. wt at -4.5 degrees C after 16 h exposure. Carbon dioxide gas exchange measurements revealed that metabolic activity was initiated during re-hydration from snow at subzero temperatures. It is proposed that water uptake from snow at subzero temperatures occurs in the gaseous phase and depends only on the temperature-related differences in water potential between the cell contents and the surrounding atmosphere in equilibrium with snow. Photosynthetic activity and re-hydration from snow at subzero temperatures are of great ecological importance for primary production in extreme environments such as Antarctica where metabolic activity is severely limited by water availability and low temperatures.",10.1111/j.1469-8137.1995.tb05729.x,0028-646X,NA,WOS:A1995TD08900014,"Scheidegger, Christoph/C-6547-2011","Scheidegger, Christoph/0000-0003-3713-5331",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,selected,,y,y,figure 1,y,no error reported

Results of these measurements are communicated in the present, first part of a series of publications. The lichen showed an extremely large and extended suprasaturation depression of its CO2 assimilation. NP at high hydration was reduced almost to the compensation point. Maximal NP was only possible in a very small window of thallus water content (WC). Thallus water relations dominated the lichen's responses to the other environmental factors and the combination of `optimal' moisture and light conditions was a rare event and lasted only for short times under natural conditions. Light response curves showed typical saturation kinetics with `sun-plant' characteristics. Maximal NP, light saturation, maximal quantum use efficiency, and light compensation point were highly dependent on WC. Temperature optimum of NP was about 22 degreesC. But, at 2 degreesC, NP was still 60\% of maximal NP. Under optimal WC, NP became saturated at c 1000 ppm external CO2 and, at natural, ambient CO2, NP was 62\% of maximal NP with a CO2 compensation point of 16 ppm. Suprasaturation depression of NP was not completely removed by 5000 ppm external CO2, Seasonal changes in photosynthetic capacity and other photosynthetic parameters were extremely small. However, dark respiratory capacity showed a clear adaptation to low winter temperatures. This resulted in a higher light compensation point for CO2 exchange in winter than in summer.

Respiration and photosynthesis of the foliaceous lichen, Xanthoria elegans, in the dehydrated state were below the threshold of CO2-detection by infrared gas analysis. Following hydration, respiration totally recovered within seconds and photosynthesis within minutes. In order to identify metabolic processes that may contribute to the quick and efficient reactivation of lichen physiological processes, we analysed the metabolite profile of lichen thalli step by step during hydration/dehydration cycles, using P-31- and C-13-NMR. It appeared that the recovery of respiration was prepared during dehydration by the accumulation of a reserve of gluconate 6-P (glcn-6-P) and by the preservation of nucleotide pools, whereas glycolytic and photosynthetic intermediates like glucose 6-P and ribulose 1,5-diphosphate were absent. The large pools of polyols present in both X. elegans photo- and mycobiont are likely to contribute to the protection of cell constituents like nucleotides, proteins, and membrane lipids, and to preserve the integrity of intracellular structures during desiccation. Our data indicate that glcn-6-P accumulated due to activation of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, in response to a need for reducing power (NADPH) during the dehydration-triggered down-regulation of cell metabolism. On the contrary, glcn-6-P was metabolised immediately after hydration, supplying respiration with substrates during the replenishment of pools of glycolytic and photosynthetic intermediates. Finally, the high net photosynthetic activity of wet X. elegans thalli at low temperature may help this alpine lichen to take advantage of brief hydration opportunities such as ice melting, thus favouring its growth in harsh high mountain climates.",10.1007/s00425-007-0563-6,0032-0935,1432-2048,WOS:000249316500019,"Juge, Christine/I-6620-2012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,selected,,y,y,figure 1,,

Their physiological vigour is derived from high freezing tolerance and the ability to be photosynthetically activated by water vapour uptake from snow at temperatures as low as c. -20 degrees C.

The strong response of DR to temperature in these organisms resulted in substantial changes in CO2 exchange rates. The moss Bryum argenteum Hedw. showed a strong, linear relationship between GP and ETR. This was an unexpected result since mosses are C-3 plants and, in higher plants, this group normally has a curvilinear GP versus ETR relationship. It is suggested that suppression of DR in the light might be involved. The lichen, Umbilicaria aprina Nyl., had nonlinear relationships between ETR and GP that were different at each measurement temperature. In some cases the lowest ETR was at the higher CO2 exchange rates. It is suggested that these relationships are the result of strong quenching mechanisms that are inversely proportional to GP.

This study addresses the hypothesis that the lack of bryophytes in the lowlands is due to high-temperature effects on the carbon balance. In particular, it is tested experimentally whether temperature responses of CO2-exchange rates would lead to higher respiratory carbon losses at night, relative to potential daily gains, in lowland compared with lower montane forests. Methods Gas-exchange measurements were used to determine water-, light-, CO2- and temperature-response curves of net photosynthesis and dark respiration of 18 tropical bryophyte species from three altitudes (sea level, 500 m and 1200 m) in Panama. Key Results Optimum temperatures of net photosynthesis were closely related to mean temperatures in the habitats in which the species grew at the different altitudes. The ratio of dark respiration to net photosynthesis at mean ambient night and day temperatures did not, as expected, decrease with altitude. Water-, light- and CO2-responses varied between species but not systematically with altitude. Conclusions Drivers other than temperature-dependent metabolic rates must be more important in explaining the altitudinal gradient in bryophyte abundance. This does not discard near-zero carbon balances as a major problem for lowland species, but the main effect of temperature probably lies in increasing evaporation rates, thus restricting the time available for photosynthetic carbon gain, rather than in increasing nightly respiration rates. Since optimum temperatures for photosynthesis were so fine tuned to habitat temperatures we analysed published temperature responses of bryophyte species worldwide and found the same pattern on the large scale as we found along the tropical mountain slope we studied.",10.1093/aob/mcs267,0305-7364,1095-8290,WOS:000316691800013,"Zotz, Gerhard/Q-5365-2018 Bader, Maaike/AAG-4451-2019 Bader, Maaike/M-7998-2013","Zotz, Gerhard/0000-0002-6823-2268 Bader, Maaike/0000-0003-4300-7598 Bader, Maaike/0000-0003-4300-7598",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,selected,,y,y,figure 3 ,,

Modelling of carbon gain using field and laboratory data,OECOLOGIA,1997,109,1,18-Oct,JAN,"Photosynthetic and respiratory CO2 gas exchange was measured under controlled climate conditions in the laboratory in two epiphytic lichens, Lobaria pulmonaria and Platismatia glauca, with the aim of modelling their net productivity using field microclimate data. For both, the thallus water content (WC) and the light intensity had the greatest impact on photosynthesis. L. pulmonaria had optimum net photosynthesis (NP) at WCs between 75-175\% of the thallus dry weight (DW), while P. glauca required a WC of c. 85\% for maximal NP without depression at higher WCs. Both species reached light compensation of NP at 5-10 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) and were saturated at 100-150 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1). Respiratory CO2 loss corresponded to 35-40\% of gross photosynthesis at. 85-100\% WC and 15 degrees C, in both species. Growth of the two species were followed in transplanted thalli during a 16-month period at two contrasting sites, a forest edge adjacent to a 15 year old clear-cut and within the interior of a mature Picea abies forest. At these sites, the microclimate parameters; light, temperature, relative humidity (RH) and thallus WC were also monitored. Judged from the microclimate data, the lichens were active for 13-19\% of the time with thallus WC monitoring, where >60\% of the active time occurred in darkness. When photosynthetically active, the edge transplants received a 2-3 times higher light dose and were active for a longer accumulated time compared to the interior transplants. The field microclimate data in conjunction with the laboratory data predicted a 4 times higher DW yield of the edge transplants compared to the interior transplants. However, the DW yield of L. pulmonaria was overestimated at the edge and underestimated for P. glauca in the interior by our model.

The hypothesis that this height-related niche partitioning reflects differential growth responses to gradients in canopy microclimate is examined. Field measurements of canopy microclimate, taken over a 2-year period, were used in conjunction with laboratory-based measurements of net photosynthesis (NP) and dark respiration to model net assimilation (NA) response of Alectoria sarmentosa and Bryoria spp. (mixed collections of Bryoria fremontii and B. pseudofuscescens) at two different heights (15 and 4 m) within the canopy. Microclimate measurements indicate that lichen thalli are regularly hydrated from snowmelt events during the winter period (October-April), totalling 26 and 29\% of the time, respectively, for Alectoria and Bryoria, though most winter hydration exposure (c. 75\%) occurred in the dark. In the summer (May-September), rainfall was the major hydration source, with Alectoria and Bryoria each hydrated c. 16\% of the time (45\% of this in the dark). The NP temperature optimum (T-opt) in light saturated thalli of Alectoria was 18.1 and 22.9degreesC, for winter and summer measurements, respectively. In Bryoria the corresponding seasonal rise in T-opt was smaller, from 15.9 to 16.3degreesC. Both species showed an increase in maximum rates of NP during the summer period, from 1.52 to 1.92 mg CO2 g(-1) h(-1) for Alectoria, and from 1.79 to 2.33 mg CO2 g(-1) h(-1) for Bryoria. Although lichen hydration events peaked in early winter (October and November), NA modelling predicts that maximum growth should occur during the summer period. In Alectoria, higher rates of NA were predicted for thalli in lower canopy positions, especially during the summer months. In Bryoria, no clear trends of NA uptake with canopy position were observed. Thus, while NP response to gradients of canopy microclimate may provide a basis for niche partitioning in Alectoria, other factors (perhaps exclusionary) may be more important for Bryoria. One such factor is documented, namely the greater sensitivity of Bryoria to extended hydration exposure and we speculate that greater rates of fragmentation in upper canopy exposures may limit upper canopy biomass accumulation in Alectoria. Niche partitioning in these alectorioid lichens may therefore reflect both positive (growth responses) and negative (physical and physiological limitations) responses to gradients in canopy microclimate.

In addition, responses to experimentally controlled water content (WC), photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), and temperature were studied for L. phyllocarpum. Performance of the Leptogium species was compared with two other, but heteromerous, cyanolichens from the same site and treated in earlier publications (Dictyonema glabratum, Sticta tomentosa). Net photosynthesis (NP) of L. phyllocarpum was adapted to high temperatures with an upper temperature compensation point well above 40 degrees C. The light saturation of NP was highly dependent on WC and occurred at PPFD levels between 100 and 600 mu mol m(-2)s(-1). Light compensation point was about 20 mu mol m(-2)s(-1) and increased with decreasing WC. All three Leptogium species suffered from a strong depression of NP at suprasaturating WC, which reduced CO2 assimilation by 55 to more than 80\%, compared to the maximum. Natural NP was controlled by the interplay of thallus hydration and radiation. In contrast to the heteromerous species, high water holding capacity of the gelatinous lichens, especially of L. phyllocarpum, shortened the periods of inactivity through desiccation, thus essentially extending the daily time span for photosynthetic activity. However, high WC reduced the rates of CO2 fixation. A rough estimate for L. azureum reveals that net photosynthetic carbon gain would be increased by about one third in the absence of suprasaturation depression. In spite of these limitations, average daily net photosynthetic carbon gain of mature thalli of all three Leptogium species was relatively high [}between 6.2 and 9 mgC (gC)(-1)d(-1), as related to thallus carbon content]. However, a very large portion of assimilated carbon - on average 60 to 90\% - was lost again through nocturnal respiration which was stimulated by high night temperatures of the continuously moist thalli. The resulting diel carbon balance amounted from 0.6 to 3.6 mgC (gC)(-1)d(-1) Abundance of Leptogium species and of other macrolichens was high in the lower montana forest, it was low in warmer lowland rainforests of the same area.

Not surprisingly, the light response curves of NP showed saturation at rather low light levels. Rehydration was associated with an initial resaturation burst of short duration, which could be demonstrated both under natural conditions and experimentally. This additional loss of CO2 seems too low to be ecologically relevant. Moreover, high thallus hydration was also detrimental to NP: at maximum water content net CO2 uptake was depressed by > 50\%.

Experiments were conducted in the snow-free season of 2000 using an open-flow gas exchange system with an infrared gas analyser. Positive photosynthetic activities were observed on rainy days or soon after rainfall when the thallus water content was high, whereas photosynthetic activities dropped below the detectable limit on clear days because of the low thallus water content.

Responses to experimentally controlled water content (WC), photosynthetic photon fluence rate (PPFR), and temperature were studied in most detail with P. aurata. Photosynthesis was well adapted to high temperatures, and all species exhibited `shade plant' characteristics with low light compensation points and low light saturation. Lobatia and Pseudocyphellaria species suffered from a strong depression of net photosynthesis (NP) at suprasaturating WC; suprasaturation depression was less in cyphellate Sticta species. Photosynthetic capacity correlated with thallus nitrogen concentration, and maximal NP rates of the cyanobacterial Sticta species was 4 to 5 times higher than that of the green algal Lobatia species. However, high rates of NP were uncommon and brief events under natural conditions; the different environmental factors were rarely optimal simultaneously. Similar to earlier observations with other rainforest lichens, NP ceased during the period of highest irradiation on most days due to desiccation. During moist periods low light often limited carbon fixation, and high thallus hydration was often detrimental to NP.

In both species light saturation was not reached up to 700 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD except at 0 degrees C. By contrast, the temperature dependence of CO2 gas exchange differed substantially between U. grisea and U. freyi. Both species gave significant rates at 0 degrees C. Optimal temperatures of NP were always higher in U. grisea at various PPFD levels if the samples were kept at optimal thallus water content. NP showed maximal rates at 95\% dw in U. grisea and 110\% dw in U. freyi respectively. In U. grisea a much stronger depression of NP was observed with only 5\% of maximal NP reached at 180\% dw. At all PPFD and temperature combinations U. freyi showed higher rates of NP and more negative rates of DR if calculated on a dry weight basis. This was also true under natural conditions at the same site, when U. freyi was always more productive than U. grisea. The differences in the photosynthetic response to temperature between both species correlated well with the different distribution patterns of both species. The possibility of genetic control of the physiological performance of these species and its influence on their distribution patterns and autecology is discussed.

In circumpolar areas where lichens are an important component of boreal and Arctic ecosystems, winter climate is changing, leading to increased frequency of winter thaw and ground-icing events. It is imperative to elucidate in further detail how northern vegetation responds to being encapsulated in ice. A winter icing simulation experiment was therefore undertaken, encapsulating two reindeer lichens (Cladonia stellaris and Cladonia rangiferina) and two epiphytic lichens (Parmeliopsis ambigua and Melanohalea olivacea) in ice at temperatures just below freezing for a maximum period of 98 d. Photosynthetic and chlorophyll fluorescence rates decreased strongly, clearly suggesting that the algal partner of the lichens was dying. Low but detectable respiration rates indicate that the fungal partner maintained some physiological activity. Ethanol accumulated in the lichens during ice encapsulation as a result of anaerobic respiration. The algae probably were dying from a combination of depletion of carbon reserves and toxic levels of ethanol and other stress metabolites. This experiment shows that boreal and Arctic-alpine lichens are sensitive to a warmer and more fluctuating winter climate. Increasing frequency of winter icing events may therefore have extensive and hitherto unknown effects on lichen-dominated ecosystems, their herbivores and the indigenous peoples whose livelihoods largely depend on them.

Exchanges of water and sugars between the symbionts are the established mechanisms that support lichen symbiosis. Herein, we present a new linkage between algal photosynthesis and fungal respiration in lichen Flavoparmelia caperata that extends the physiological nature of symbiotic co-dependent metabolisms, mutually boosting energy conversion rates in both symbionts. Measurements of electron transport by oximetry show that photosynthetic O-2 is consumed internally by fungal respiration. At low light intensity, very low levels of O-2 are released, while photosynthetic electron transport from water oxidation is normal as shown by intrinsic chlorophyll variable fluorescence yield (period-4 oscillations in flash-induced Fv/Fm). The rate of algal O-2 production increases following consecutive series of illumination periods, at low and with limited saturation at high light intensities, in contrast to light saturation in free-living algae. We attribute this effect to arise from the availability of more CO2 produced by fungal respiration of photosynthetically generated sugars.

Climate change is expected to have large effects on biocrusts and associated ecosystem processes. However, few studies so far have experimentally assessed how expected changes in temperature and rainfall will affect soil respiration in biocrust-dominated ecosystems. We evaluated the impacts of biocrust development, increased air temperature and decreased precipitation on soil respiration dynamics during dry (2009) and wet (2010) years, and investigated the relative importance of soil temperature and moisture as environmental drivers of soil respiration, in a semiarid grassland from central Spain. Soil respiration rates were significantly lower in the dry than in the wet year, regardless of biocrust cover. Warming increased soil respiration rates, but this response was only significant in `biocrust-dominated areas (>50\% biocrust cover). Warming also increased the temperature sensitivity (Q(10) values) of soil respiration in biocrust-dominated areas, particularly during the wet year. The combination of warming and rainfall exclusion had similar effects in low biocrust cover areas. Our results highlight the importance of biocrusts as a modulator of soil respiration responses to both warming and rainfall exclusion, and indicate that they must be explicitly considered when evaluating soil respiration responses to climate change in drylands.

Simultaneously weather data and chlorophyll fluorescence were recorded. The periods of metabolic activity for the lichen were restricted because of the low water holding capacity of its thin thallus and high desiccation rates. The total activity was only 35.6\% of the year made up of net photosynthetic CO2 uptake, 16.7\%, and respiratory CO2 release, 18.9\%. This was substantially less than found for gelatinous or foliose lichens under similar conditions. The active time was longest in October (57.7\%) and shortest in June (17.2\%). Lecanora muralis suffered from strong suprasaturation depression of net photosynthesis so that its carbon gain was substantially limited after heavy wetting. Averaged over the total year, net photosynthesis (NP) of the lichen was heavily depressed through suprasaturation for 38.5\% of that time when photosynthesis was possible. NP took place under snow and at subzero thallus temperatures (between -4 and -5degreesC). Water status was the most important factor that determined the diurnal patterns of NP. Diel time courses of photosynthetic and respiratory performance could be divided in several response types such as lichen dry all day, lichen moistened by dew or frost, rain during night and subsequent drying during the day, rain during the day with or without suprasaturation depression, and lichen below snow. The seasonal distribution of these response types was analysed. Optimal NP was only possible over a very small range of WC (water content) that rarely occurred in combination with optimal light and temperature conditions. Thus, maximal rates of NP were seldom attained and then lasted only for a short time, sometimes no longer than a few minutes. The interplay between weather conditions and physiological responses of the lichen is discussed whilst diel, seasonal and annual carbon gain and carbon balance of L. muralis will be analysed in a further communication.",10.1016/S0367-2530(04)70052-3,0367-2530,NA,WOS:000181164900005,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,selected,unclear,n,n,ambient ,,

In addition, the impacts of precipitation, soil temperature, and moisture on soil respiration were investigated.Results and discussionThe effect of warming on soil respiration varied with soil water availability. Our results showed that soil respiration in moss-crusted and lichen-crusted areas in the warming treatment was significantly lower than that in the control. The observed inhibition of soil respiration by the increase in soil temperature was likely due to the reduction in soil moisture caused by the increased water evaporation rate under higher soil temperature. Warming also decreased cumulative C release in moss-crusted and lichen-crusted areas. Moreover, cumulative C release showed marked seasonal variations, with the highest C release occurring in summer and the lowest in winter. Over the seasonal cycle, soil respiration rates were positively correlated with precipitation, soil temperature, and volumetric soil water content.ConclusionsThe results of this study indicate that warming may increase the sensitivity of soil respiration to water availability in biocrust-dominated areas in desert ecosystems, suggesting that biocrust should be considered in projections of future C budget.",10.1007/s11368-018-2171-4,1439-0108,1614-7480,WOS:000459805400011,"Li, Chenhui/AAL-8984-2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,selected,,n,n,"soil respiration rates and soil temperature, not really relevant ",,

Eliminating non-temperature-driven effects, which tend to confound the response in R-s is possible with Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA), a non-parametric approach to timeseries analysis. R-s and ancillary data were collected at three microsites in a desert-shrubland ecosystem in northwest China over a three-year period (i.e., 2013-2015). The microsites include desert-sites with non-biocrusted, lichen-crusted, and moss-crusted soil surfaces, or NC, LC, and MC, respectively. Results revealed that temperature sensitivity in R-s (i.e., Q(10)) based on the original, un-processed R-s-data and a seasonal equation relating R-s to temperature were similar among microsites, with similar amplitudes in R-s. High-frequency bins of R-s with sub-signals with a period < 90 days, obtained by subtracting the low-frequency bins from timeseries of R-s were positively correlated with soil moisture (theta) at all microsites. Whereas, the same high-frequency bins were individually decoupled from soil temperature at LC and MC. This suggests that the influence of theta on the response in R-s to temperature dominated the R-s-measurements over the shorter term. After eliminating the non-temperature effects on R-s with SSA, Qio tended to produce lower values, i.e., 1.40, 1.28, and 1.34 for NC, LC and MC, respectively, when compared to cases where non-temperature effects were not removed, yielding a mean of 2.28. Q(10)-values estimated with SSA-processed R-s-data were consistent with those published at the ecosystem level (i.e., Re similar to 1.40). The research suggests that SSA-adjusted Q(10)-values tend to be similar with those at the ecosystem scale.

All species showed a continuous, covering epilayer of fungal origin that consisted of relatively sparse, scattered cell lumina of reduced diameter connected by cell wall-derived material.

Interactions between symbionts were mainly limited to wall-to-wall contacts without penetration. The epilayer showed continuity with the fungal prothallus at the perimeter of the thalli. Crystalline deposits in the upper portions of thalli were common, particularly in the species of Gyalectidium examined.

Global warming and changes in precipitation patterns are expected to be important triggers for biological activity in BSC-dominated desert ecosystems. Therefore, it is crucial to study the effects of warming and rainfall pulses on soil respiration dynamics at BSC-dominated microsites to predict terrestrial carbon cycling under climate change. In this study, soil respiration rates were monitored continuously during three types of natural precipitation events in lichen-dominated and moss-dominated crusts in both control and warming treatments. Our results revealed that soil respiration was inhibited in BSC-dominated microsites in the warming treatment because of reduced soil water content induced by the warmer conditions, and that the extent of inhibition was lower in the lichen-dominated crusts than in the moss-dominated crusts. During all the precipitation events, soil respiration rates were significantly increased by rainfall pulses and gradually declined thereafter. Over the daily cycle, the clockwise diel hysteresis loop between soil respiration and soil temperature was modified by soil water availability, which was affected by the magnitude of rainfall pulses. Moreover, the effect of photosynthetically active radiation and the mismatch between the depth of carbon dioxide (CO2) production and soil temperature measurement may have contributed to the diel hysteresis pattern.

To address this paradox, we consider lichens as microbial communities and propose the ``community adaptation'' hypothesis, which posits that in each thermal regime there is an equilibrium between photosynthetic primary producers (photobionts), and heterotrophic consumers (mycobiont and parasymbiont fungi). This equilibrium, expressed as the producer/consumer ratio (R-p/c), maximizes the fitness of the community. As respiration increases with temperature, more rapidly than does photosynthesis, R-p/c will shift accordingly in warm habitats, resulting in a high-growth temperature optimum for the community (the lichen).

However, recent global syntheses indicate that the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (R-S) in drylands, the largest biome on Earth, is actually lower in warmed than in control plots. Consequently, soil C losses with future warming are expected to be low compared with other biomes. Nevertheless, the empirical basis for these global extrapolations is still poor in drylands, due to the low number of field experiments testing the pathways behind the long-term responses of soil respiration (R-S) to warming. Importantly, global drylands are covered with biocrusts (communities formed by bryophytes, lichens, cyanobacteria, fungi, and bacteria), and thus, R-S responses to warming may be driven by both autotrophic and heterotrophic pathways. Here, we evaluated the effects of 8-year experimental warming on R-S, and the different pathways involved, in a biocrust-dominated dryland in southern Spain.

Vascular plants in the Northern Hemisphere extend to the northern-most edges of the continents, but only two taxa are present as far south as the Antarctic Peninsula region in the Southern Hemisphere. Lower plants, lichens in particular, become more important with increasing latitudes and form the dominant element of the Antarctic vegetation. Based on recent investigations and literature, this paper discusses to what extent lichens are better adapted to snow and ice than vascular plants. Vascular plants in high latitudes have high freezing tolerances but are photosynthetically inactive in winter (e.g., evergreen coniferous species), while lichens in a highly freezing-tolerant stage can be active and productive under winter conditions. Vascular plants can be active under snow but have no photosynthesis if the tissue is frozen. Recent in situ measurements indicate that lichens are able to photosynthesize at temperatures below -10-degrees-C, apparently in the frozen state. It was also found that photosynthetic CO2 exchange of dry thalli can be activated by snow during frost. Water uptake during winter was also recorded for coniferous trees at the arctic timberline. This uptake may reduce water stress in conifers but apparently has no relevance for metabolic activity. Water uptake from snow and metabolic activity at -10-degrees-C are possible for lichens because they are able to photosynthesize at water potentials lower than -20 MPa. Although lichens are adapted to be active in snow at low temperatures, strong light on clear days may inhibit the photosynthetic apparatus.",10.14430/arctic1356,0004-0843,1923-1245,WOS:A1993MQ45000003,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,selected,,n,n,no temperature dependent figures (did reference Lange and Kpapen 1972),,

However, the interaction between temperature and soil respiration remains uncertain because of the number of factors that control soil respiration, including temperature and soil moisture, especially in BSC-dominated areas. In this study, the soil respiration in moss-dominated crusts and lichen-dominated crusts was continuously measured using an automated soil respiration system over a one-year period from November 2015 to October 2016 in the Shapotou region of the Tengger Desert, northern China. The results indicated that over daily cycles, the half-hourly soil respiration rates in both types of BSC-covered areas were commonly related to the soil temperature. The observed diel hysteresis between the half-hourly soil respiration rates and soil temperature in the BSC-covered areas was limited by nonlinearity loops with semielliptical shapes, and soil temperature often peaked later than the half-hourly soil respiration rates in the BSC-covered areas. The average lag times between the half-hourly soil respiration rates and soil temperature for both types of BSC-covered areas were two hours over the diel cycles, and they were negatively and linearly related to the volumetric soil water content. Our results highlight the diel hysteresis phenomenon that occurs between soil respiration rates and soil temperatures in BSC-covered areas and the negative response of this phenomenon to soil moisture, which may influence total C budget evaluations.

The continuity of the data over a total of 15 months of measurements enabled integrals to be calculated of diet, monthly, seasonal, and annual sums of photosynthetic carbon income (SigmaNP), respiratory carbon loss (SigmaDR) and carbon budget (net primary production, SigmaC = SigmaNP - SigmaDR). Annual SigmaNP for the period July 1995 through June 1996 was 50021 mg m(-2) year(-1) but respiratory processes lost 57\% of this n year Much smaller so that SigmaC amounted to 21494 mg m(-2) year(-1) (20.7\% of thallus carbon content). If summer 1996, which had a I productivity than summer 1995, is included, annual SigmaC was only 15.8\% of carbon content for the period October 1995 through September 1996. The lichen showed extremely high variability in its daily CO2 exchange, and performance depended almost completely on the momentary hydration conditions. Diet SigmaNP and SigmaC were not greatly influenced by thallus temperature, and manner of moistening was more important than high PPFD. Days with favourable primary production occurred in all seasons. Negative diet SigmaC was frequent through the year and carbon loss occurred on 25\% of the 274 days of the year on which the lichen was metabolically active. The various weather response types, because of their characteristic influence on the mode and extend of thallus hydration, differed considerably in their contribution to the annual carbon balance of the lichen. 74 days of heavy rain during the year produced only 4.2\% of the annual SigmaC, because, under Such conditions, SigmaDR was high and SigmaNP was limited by depression of thallus gas exchange due to suprasaturation. In contrast, days with dew (40.0\% of annual SigmaC in 105 days) or those with nocturnal rain and subsequent drying (28.5\% in 57 days) were the best contributors to annual SigmaC. Differences in the frequency of occurrence of the different weather condition types through the year meant that lichen productivity apparently followed a seasonal pattern, each season resulting in a positive carbon balance. Autumn and Summer 1995 were the most productive seasons, and the lowest was spring with no more than 18\% of the autumn production. In summer, the season which was covered twice during the measurements, SigmaC was less than one fourth in 1996 of that in 1995, underlining the high variability in the photosynthetic production of the lichen. Thus, firm generalisations are still not possible about seasonality of production for this species. There was no correlation between monthly SigmaC and monthly rainfall. Due to the complex interdependencies of CO2 exchange of L. muralis simple predictions of its carbon budget from meteorological standard data are likely to be very difficult or even impossible.",10.1016/S0367-2530(04)70071-7,0367-2530,NA,WOS:000185560400003,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,selected,likely not relevant,n,n,"no temperature depedence, all time series ",,

A biophysical model included the water potential of the air, derived from measurements of air temperature, relative humidity and species-specific rate constants for desiccation and rehydration. A reduced physical model, included only environmental parameters, assuming instantaneous equilibration between the lichen and the air. These models were developed using field and laboratory data for three green algal lichens: the foliose epiphytic Platismatia glauca (L.) W. Culb., the fruticose epiphytic Alectoria sarmentosa (Ach.) Ach. and the fruticose, terricolous and mat-forming Cladina rangiferina (L.) Weber ex Wigg. The models were compared and validated for the same three species using data from a habitat with a different microclimate. Both models predicted the length and timing of lichen hydration periods, with those for A. sarmentosa and P. glauca being highly accurate-nearly 100\% of the total wet time was predicted by both the biophysical and physical models. These models also predicted an accurate timing of the total realized wet time for A. sarmentosa and P. glauca when the lichens were wet. The model accuracy was lower for C. rangiferina compared to the epiphytes, both for the total realized wet time and for the accuracy of the timing for the hydration period. These results demonstrate that the stochastic and continually varying hydration status of lichens can be simulated from biophysical data. Further development of these models to also include water-related activity, light and temperature conditions during the hydration events will then be a potent tool to assess potential lichen productivity in landscapes and habitats of various microclimatic conditions.",10.1007/s00442-008-0990-5,0029-8549,NA,WOS:000255954100002,"Palmqvist, Kristin/D-5589-2016","Palmqvist, Kristin/0000-0002-3923-1338",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,selected,,n,n,modelled data and no temperature dependence,,

Lichens are a major winter food source for reindeer in most parts of the circumpolar region. A laboratory experiment tested how three hydrated reindeer forage lichen species covered by snow, encapsulated in ice, or uncovered responded to storage at freezing temperatures and subsequent warming. Photosynthetic performance (maximal fluorescence of dark-adapted samples and net photosynthetic rates) was significantly lower in lichens not insulated by snow or ice, whereas there were few differences between the snow and ice treatments. It is suggested that snow and ice provide sufficiently moist environments to improve extracellular and reduce intracellular ice nucleation activity. Ice encapsulation, which is often lethal to vascular plants, did not have any negative effects on the studied lichens.

Here, we analyse the response of a lichen and moss community to 10 years of passive environmental manipulation using open-top chambers (OTCs) in the maritime Antarctic region. Cover of the dominant lichen Usnea antarctica declined by 71 \% in the OTCs. However, less dominant lichen species showed no significant responses except for an increase in Ochrolechia frigida, which typically covered dying lichen and moss vegetation. There were no detectable responses in the moss or associated micro-arthropod communities to the influence of the OTCs. Based on calculated respiration rates, we hypothesise that the decline of U. antarctica was most likely caused by increased net winter respiration rates (11 \%), driven by the higher temperatures and lower light levels experienced inside the OTCs as a result of greater snow accumulation. During summer, U. antarctica appears unable to compensate for this increased carbon loss, leading to a negative carbon balance on an annual basis, and the lichen therefore appears to be vulnerable to such climate change simulations.

In the present work, (micro)biological and physicochemical properties indicative of soil functionality were studied in two different biocrust types dominated by Dipolschistes diacapsis and Lepraria isidiata and in underlying soil at two different depths (SL1, soil layer right below the biocrusts, and SL2, soil layer underlying SL1) at the Tabernas desert (southeast Spain). The influence of climatic factors (rainfall and temperature) and general soil properties on the (micro)biological properties were also analyzed in different environmental (climatic) conditions over a period of two years. PERMANOVA analyses showed significant statistical differences (Pseudo-F = 63.9; P (perm) = 0.001) among biocrust and soil layers. Throughout the study period, enzyme activities involved in C, N, and P cycles; microbial biomass-C; basal respiration; and several properties directly related to ecosystem productivity (total organic carbon, total nitrogen, concentration of ammonium and nitrate) were higher in both biocrust types than in the underlying soil layers, showing that biocrusts improved soil functions related to nutrient cycling. These properties progressively diminished in successive soil layers under the biocrusts (biocrusts > SL1 > SL2). Biocrusts showed greater similarity to each other and to SL1 than to SL2 in (micro)biological properties. A distance-based linear model analysis showed that total organic carbon, rainfall, pH, mineralized NNH4+, and total nitrogen were the most important variables for predicting (micro)biological soil properties in biocrusts. Different biochemical behavior between the biocrusts and successive underlying soil layers has been found in wet periods. After rainfall periods, the biocrusts showed important peaks in basal soil respiration and in enzyme activities involved in C and P cycles. Nevertheless, soil biochemical properties hardly showed any peak in SL1 and did not change in SL2 despite soil moisture being higher in the soil layers below the biocrusts. Correlation analyses corroborated the existence of different relationships between soil moisture and enzymatic activities. In biocrusts, soil moisture showed a greater number of significant positive correlations with enzymes such as beta-glucosidase, invertase, and phosphomonoesterase among others, whereas in SL1 it was only correlated with cellulase and in SL2 with dehydrogenase. A change in rainfall regime, as predicted by models based on climate change in arid and semiarid zones, could affect the activity of soil enzymes in the biocrusts and underlying layers, thus aggravating the degradation of these fragile dryland ecosystems.

A comparison of thalli of M. tesselata from the shoreline with thalli collected further inland showed significant differences in maximum water content and in rates of water loss and uptake between thalli from these sites, which could be ascribed to the presence of salt in the thalli of M. tesselata from the shore. Thallus samples of Usnea antarctica collected from an exposed site showed lower uptake rates and higher loss rates of water than samples collected from a more sheltered site. Under laboratory conditions the maximum moisture content ranged from 67\% in Usnea antarctica to 391\% in M. tesselata.

Rates of water loss diminished with time, and after 4-6 hours equilibrium was reached, with water contents of 14-16\% of thallus dry weight The microclimate is the driving force for the thallus water regime. Specific differences in rates of water loss and water uptake depend on the morphology and anatomy of the lichen thalli.

Knowledge of the factors that drive soil respiration in drylands is limited, despite these regions represent more than 40\% of the Earth land's surface.

However, the temporal dynamics and main drivers of CO2 efflux in biocrusts compared to other representative dryland covers such as bare soil and soil under perennial grasses, has not been fully investigated. In this study, we measured the soil CO2 molar fraction (chi(c)) at 2 and 5 cm depths in representative surface covers (cyanobacteria and lichen dominated biocrusts, soil under the alpha grass Macrochloa tenacissima and bare soil) from a semiarid area in SE Spain (Tabernas desert, Almeria) using small solid-state CO2 sensors, during one hydrological year. We determined the CO2 efflux (F-s) from the 0 to 5 cm soil profile using the gradient method. Our results show that soil chi(c) and F-s were low in all surface covers (on average, 464 ppm at 5 cm) during dry soil periods (soil moisture <0.05 m(3) m(-3)). chi(c) and subsequent F-s rapidly increased after rainfall, and showed the highest values in the soil under grass (M. tenacissima) and lichen biocrusts. Time series analysis of F-s allowed identifying periodic patterns in F-s strongly related to moisture and temperature periodicities. Moisture was the main driver for F-s on timescales of weeks and months, while temperature was the main driver on daily scales. Moisture exerted a greater influence on F-s in lichen and soil under grass, while temperature had a greater effect on F-s in cyanobacteria and bare soil.

In light crusts from both Utah and New Mexico, net photosynthesis was highest at temperatures > 30 degrees C. Net photosynthesis in light crusts from Utah was relatively insensitive to changes in soil moisture. In contrast, light crusts from New Mexico tended to exhibit higher rates of net photosynthesis at higher soil moisture. Dark crusts originating from both sites exhibited the greatest net photosynthesis at intermediate soil water content (40-60\%). Declines in net photosynthesis were observed in dark crusts with crusts from Utah showing declines at temperatures > 25 degrees C and those originating from New Mexico showing declines at temperatures > 35 degrees C. Maximum net photosynthesis in all crust types from all locations were strongly influenced by offsets in the optimal temperature and water content for gross photosynthesis compared with dark respiration. Gross photosynthesis tended to be maximized at some intermediate value of temperature and water content and dark respiration tended to increase linearly.

Chlorophyll fluorescence, net photosynthesis and dark respiration were measured in situ bimonthly during a year. We also conducted daily cycle measurements of net photosynthesis in winter and at the end of spring. In Sorbas, warming reduced the fixation of atmospheric C in biocrust-dominated microsites throughout the year. In Aranjuez, there was an interaction between the three factors evaluated; during winter, net photosynthesis was significantly greater in high biocrust cover plots under natural conditions and in the rainfall exclusion treatment. During the daily surveys, rainfall exclusion and warming reduced C fixation in Sorbas and in Aranjuez respectively. The effects of the treatments evaluated varied with the rainfall and non-rainfall water inputs (NRWIs) registered before the measurements. Our results suggest that changes in NRWI regimes as consequence of warming could have a greater impact on the C balance of biocrusts than changes in rainfall amounts.

We analyzed whole ecosystem carbon exchange rates as well as nutrient dynamics, microbial and plant community composition and biomass after 2 years of experimental temperature increase. Plant biomass increased significantly with warming, mainly due to the strong response of lichens, the dominant plant group within this ecosystem. Experimental warming also increased soil nitrogen pools and nitrogen turnover rates. Major changes in soil microbial and plant composition, however, were not detected. Although experimental warming increased gross ecosystem productivity, the higher plant biomass did not compensate for the much greater increase in C losses. Ecosystem respiration and net ecosystem CO2 losses were significantly higher in warmed plots compared to control ones. We suggest that this was due to increased soil respiration, since soil carbon pools were lower in warmed soils, at least in the upper horizons. Our study thus supports the general hypothesis that tundra ecosystems turn from a carbon sink to a carbon source when temperatures increase in the short-term.

Thus, they play an important role in CO2 fluxes in these regions, where water availability limits vascular plant growth and development. The effect of biocrusts on CO2 fluxes was expected to be controlled by the interplay of several environmental factors, as well as biocrust developmental stage and coverage. To test this hypothesis, we performed an in situ study during which we measured net CO2 fluxes and dark respiration over biocrusted soils at different successional stages in two semiarid ecosystems, where biocrusts are one of the main surface components. In addition, CO2 flux was measured in annual plants, which were an abundant interplant cover in one of the study sites during the measurement period. Field campaigns were conducted from early morning to dusk on selected days with different environmental conditions over the year. Gross photosynthesis was calculated from net CO2 flux and dark respiration. Biocrusts showed contrasting responses in CO2 exchange depending on environmental conditions during the day and the year and depending on biocrust developmental stage. CO2 flux in biocrusts was highly correlated with soil moisture, but also with photosynthetically active radiation and temperature. During dry soil periods, soils colonized by biocrusts had net CO2 fluxes close to zero, but after precipitation events (light or heavy) all the biocrust types began to photosynthesize. When the rainfall was right after an extended drought, the respiration by biocrusts themselves and underlying soil exceeded the biocrust gross photosynthesis, and consequently soils colonized by biocrusts behaved as CO2 sources. On the contrary, consecutive precipitation events and mild temperatures caused soil colonization by biocrusts to behave as CO2 sinks. Annual plants were measured during their senescence and acted as CO2 sources during all measurement campaigns. The time of day when the biocrusts showed net CO2 fixation depended on the interplay of humidity just above them, air temperature and photosynthetically active radiation. The biocrust type also significantly influenced CO2 fluxes in both semiarid ecosystems. In general, during wet periods, late successional biocrusts (i.e. lichens and mosses) had higher gross photosynthesis than early successional biocrusts (developed and incipient cyanobacteria crusts). Nevertheless, dark respiration from late successional biocrusts and underlying soils was also higher than from early successional biocrusts, so both biocrust types had similar net CO2 fluxes. These results highlight the importance of considering the whole soil profile under biocrusts with their associated microbial communities as well as the temporal variability of CO2 fluxes in soils covered by biocrusts in carbon balance studies in semiarid regions.",10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.05.020,0038-0717,NA,WOS:000444358200002,"Castilla, Yolanda Canton/ABG-2175-2020 Ladron Eguilaz, Monica de Guevara Saez de/AAQ-6778-2020 Ortega Perez, Raul Ortega/AAX-7838-2021 Van+Wesemael, Bas/Y-2444-2019 Caballero, Emilio Rodriguez/N-9164-2017 Chamizo, Sonia/J-6770-2018","Castilla, Yolanda Canton/0000-0002-6848-019X Ladron Eguilaz, Monica de Guevara Saez de/0000-0003-2849-1801 Ortega Perez, Raul Ortega/0000-0003-4371-7311 Caballero, Emilio Rodriguez/0000-0002-5934-3214 Miralles, Isabel/0000-0002-7385-3720 Chamizo, Sonia/0000-0002-2980-1683",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,selected,,n,n,no temperature data ,,

In a mountain birch woodland-mire ecotone, we investigated the role of LAI (and NDVI), environmental factors (microclimate, soil moisture), and microsite type across tundra shrub plots (wet hummocks, dry hummocks, dry hollows) and lichen hummocks, in controlling net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE). During a growing season, we measured NEE fluxes continuously, with closed dynamic chambers, and performed multiple fits (one for each 3-day period) of a simple light and temperature response model to hourly NEE data. Tundra shrub plots were largely CO2 sinks, as opposed to lichen plots, although fluxes were highly variable within microsite type. For tundra shrub plots, microsite type did not influence photosynthetic parameters but it affected basal (that is, temperature-normalized) ecosystem respiration (R (0)). PAR-normalized photosynthesis (P (600)) increased with air temperature and declined with increasing vapor pressure deficit. R (0) declined with soil moisture and showed an apparent increase with temperature, which may underlie a tight link between GPP and R (eco). NDVI was a good proxy for LAI, maximum P (600) and maximum R (0) of shrub plots. Cumulative CO2 fluxes were strongly correlated with LAI (NDVI) but we observed a comparatively low GPP/LAI in dry hummocks.

They differ in abundance and vertical distribution particularly on birch trees, and these differences relate to the level and duration of the winter snow cover. Parmeliopsis ambigua is covered much of the cold season on the lower trunk whereas P. olivacea occurs well above the snow surface. Periods over 6 months under snow have no apparent effect on P. ambigua thalli while much shorter snow cover has been demonstrated to kill P. olivacea. It was hypothesized that the contrasting distributions are due to differences in growth rates and in size and quality of non-structural carbon stores in their tissues affecting their endurance to extended periods of dark respiration. To test these hypotheses, growth measurements were performed on both species and their thalli were sampled for chemical analyses. The results show that the mean annual margin extension growth of P. olivacea thalli was significantly higher than that of P. ambigua, i.e. 1.1 mm and 0.5 mm, respectively. The average nonstructural carbohydrate concentration in the two species did not differ, but the annual concentration of storage lipids (triacylglycerol) in P. ambigua was four times higher than that in P. olivacea, despite a shorter growing season and lower rate of photosynthesis. The proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids in structural (polar) lipids was high in both species, i.e. 77\% in P. olivacea and 64\% in P. ambigua, which appears to enable both species to withstand low ambient thallus temperatures. The higher concentration of storage lipids in P. ambigua allows survival in environments where P. olivacea would respire to death, e.g. under a prolonged snow cover.

Nighttime respiration was between 0.5 and 1.5 kg C ha(-1) h(-1), increasing with temperature. Net uptake of carbon during the day peaked at 3 kg C ha(-1) h(-1), and the daily net uptake over the experiment was 12 kg C ha(-1) day(-1). Photosynthesis dropped substantially at leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit (VPD) greater than 7 mb, presumably as a result of stomatal closure. The response of ecosystem photosynthesis to incident PPFD was markedly non-linear, with an abrupt saturation at 600 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). This sharp saturation reflected the geometry of the spruce canopy (isolated conical crowns), the frequently overcast conditions, and an increase in VPD coincident with high radiation. The ecosystem light-use efficiency increased markedly during overcast periods as a result of a more even distribution of light across the forest surface.

Such assessments are complicated because tundra vegetation has diverse structure and function at both local and regional stales. To investigate this diversity, the Arctic Flux Study has used the eddy covariance technique to generate ecosystem CO2-exchange data along a transect in northern Alaska. We use an extant process-based model of the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum to make independent predictions of grass photosynthesis and foliar respiration at 9 of the sites along the transect, using data on local canopy structure and meteorology. We make two key assumptions: (i) soil respiration is constant throughout the flux measurement period, so that the diurnal cycle in CO2 exchange is driven by canopy processes only (except at two sites where a soil respiration-temperature relationship was indicated in the data); and (ii) mosses and lichens play an insignificant role in ecosystem C exchange, even though in some locations their live biomass exceeds 300 g m(-2). We found that even with these assumptions the model could explain much of the dynamics of net ecosystem production (NEP) at sites with widely differing vegetation structure and moss/lichen cover. Errors were mostly associated with the predictions of maximum NEP; the likely cause of such discrepancies was (i) a mismatch between vegetation sampled for characterizing the canopy structure and that contained within the footprint of the eddy covariance flux measurements, or (ii) an increase in daytime soil and root respiration. Thus the model results tended to falsify our first assumption but not our second. We also note evidence for an actual reduction in NEP caused by water stress on warm, dry days at some sites, The model-flux comparison also suggests that photosynthesis may be less sensitive to low temperatures than leaf-level gas-exchange measurements have indicated.",10.1046/j.1365-2486.2000.06016.x,1354-1013,1365-2486,WOS:000166799900008,"Eugster, Werner/E-5116-2010 Williams, Mathew/G-6140-2016 Chapin, F Stuart/AAZ-3931-2020 ","Eugster, Werner/0000-0001-6067-0741 Williams, Mathew/0000-0001-6117-5208 Chapin, F Stuart/0000-0002-2558-9910 Rastetter, Edward/0000-0002-8620-5431",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,selected,,n,n,"tundra system, time series",,

In these ecosystems, soil water content can often be a stronger driver of soil CO2 efflux than soil temperature, or at least comparable. However, little is known on the contribution of the biocrust to soil CO2 efflux or how the respiration of the biocrust responds to soil water content and temperature. A manipulative experiment was performed in a Mediterranean shrubland ecosystem in Sardinia (Italy) to assess the contribution of the biocrust to soil CO2 efflux and to identify the main environmental drivers of the CO2 efflux. For 19 months, in situ soil CO2 efflux was measured over two different surfaces: soil deprived of biocrust (hereafter Soil) and intact soil (hereafter Soil + BC), and estimated by subtraction in a third surface: biocrust (hereafter BC). CO2 efflux emitted by Soil, BC and Soil + BC was uniquely driven by soil moisture and temperature: BC respiration was mainly controlled by soil moisture at 5 cm depth, whereas both soil temperature and water content at 20 cm depth determined Soil CO2 efflux. Soil temperature and water content at 5 cm depth drove Soil + BC respiration. We also found that biocrusts can contribute substantially (up to 60\%) to the total soil respiration depending on its moisture content. This contribution persists even in periods in which deeper soil layers are inactive, as small water pulses can activate the metabolism of carbon in soils through lichens, mosses and cyanobacteria associated with the biocrust, while deeper soil layers remain dormant. The important differences observed in CO2 efflux between Soil and Soil + BC suggest that carbon models and budgets may underestimate soil CO2 efflux in spatially heterogeneous Mediterranean areas. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for the biocrust contribution to soil respiration and its response to environmental drivers. We provide an accurate estimation of this key component of the carbon cycle at the ecosystem level in water limited ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are common dryland soil surface communities of bryophytes, lichens, and/or cyanobacteria that bind the soil surface together and that may play an important role in regulating the climatic sensitivity of the dryland C cycle. Major uncertainties exist in our understanding of the interacting effects of changing temperature and moisture on CO2 uptake (photosynthesis) and loss (respiration) from biocrust and sub-crust soil, particularly as related to biocrust successional state. Here, we used a mesocosm approach to assess how biocrust successional states related to climate treatments. We subjected bare soil (Bare), early successional lightly pigmented cyanobacterial biocrust (Early), and late successional darkly pigmented moss-lichen biocrust (Late) to either ambient or +5 degrees C above ambient soil temperature for 84days. Under ambient temperatures, Late biocrust mesocosms showed frequent net uptake of CO2, whereas Bare soil, Early biocrust, and warmed Late biocrust mesocosms mostly lost CO2 to the atmosphere. The inhibiting effect of warming on CO2 exchange was a result of accelerated drying of biocrust and soil. We used these data to parameterize, via Bayesian methods, a model of ecosystem CO2 fluxes, and evaluated the model with data from an autochamber CO2 system at our field site on the Colorado Plateau in SE Utah. In the context of the field experiment, the data underscore the negative effect of warming on fluxes both biocrust CO2 uptake and losswhich, because biocrusts are a dominant land cover type in this ecosystem, may extend to ecosystem-scale C cycling.",10.1007/s10021-018-0250-4,1432-9840,1435-0629,WOS:000458503300002,"Reed, Sasha C/ABE-9476-2020","Reed, Sasha C/0000-0002-8597-8619",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,selected,,n,n,in situ and only modeled temperature dependent with net soil exchange ,,

Late successional moss and lichen biocrusts, in particular, can increase soil C and N availability, but some data suggest these biocrust types will be replaced by early successional cyanobacterial biocrusts as the region undergoes warming and aridification. In this study, we evaluated the short-term interactive effects of biocrust successional state and elevated temperature on soil heterotrophic C and N cycling (specifically, soil respiration, N2O emissions, microbial biomass C and N, and soluble C and N). We collected soils following an 87-day greenhouse mesocosm experiment where the soils had been topped with different biocrust successional states (moss-dominated, cyanobacteria-dominated, or no biocrust) and had experienced different temperatures (ambient and warmed), under an artificial precipitation regime. Following this pre-incubation mesocosm phase, the soils were assessed using a short-term (2-day) laboratory incubation to determine the cumulative effect of the elevated temperature and altered biocrust successional state on the temperature sensitivity of soil heterotrophic C and N cycling. We found that there were interactive effects of biocrust successional state and exposure to warmer temperatures during the mesocosm phase under greenhouse conditions on the rate and temperature sensitivity of soil heterotrophic C and N cycling in laboratory incubations. Soils collected from beneath late successional biocrusts exhibited higher C and N cycling rates than those from beneath early successional crusts, while warming reduced both the magnitude and the temperature sensitivity of C and N cycling. The inhibiting effect of warming, was most evident in soils from beneath late successional biocrusts, which, during the mesocosm phase, also exhibited the greatest reductions in gross primary production and respiration in response to the warming treatment. Taken together, these data suggest that an overall effect of climate warming may be increasing resource limitation of the soil heterotrophic C and N cycles in the region, which may magnify alterations associated with the changes in biocrust community structure documented in previous studies. Overall, results from this study suggest that soil heterotrophic biogeochemical cycling is affected by interactions between temperature and the biocrust community that lives atop the mineral soil, with important implications for C and N cycling into the future.",10.3389/fevo.2020.467157,2296-701X,NA,WOS:000588022900001,"Reed, Sasha C/ABE-9476-2020","Reed, Sasha C/0000-0002-8597-8619",NA,467157,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,selected,likey not relevant,n,n,"soil communities warmed vs ambient, not a series of temperatures; only series involved predicted data trendlines (figure 6) ",,

Although the effects of temperature and moisture on such processes have been widely studied, little is known about the influence of the readily metabolizable substrate (labile C) and how this substrate varies in different types of BSCs. In the present study, BSCs formed by cyanobacteria (CYANO) and by lichens (DIPLOS and LEPRA) were incubated at 25 degrees C (optimum temperature) and different moisture levels, for evaluation of the pool of labile C in the crust layers. Labile C was estimated as the sum of CO2-C emitted and the C extracted with hot water (80 degrees C) at the end of the incubation period. In all crusts, the relationship between emission and moisture fitted a quadratic model. For the different moisture contents, the sum of CO2-C emitted and C extracted with hot water converged to a constant value for each type of crust. This value, considered as the maximum content of labile C in the crust, was extremely high in DIPLOS, reaching up to 40\% of the total organic C (TOC) initially present. In all crusts, and independently of the consumption of labile C, simple sugars (sucrose, glucose) remained at the end of the incubation period, which suggests that these sugars may play a protective role in BSCs. The presence of mannitol suggests that the fructose released during hydrolysis of sucrose was reduced to mannitol, thus enabling electron transport during moments of intense respiratory stress. The intense respiration in DIPLOS is partly due to the metabolism of polyphenols, which are possibly derived from the growth and death of free-living fungi that proliferate during incubation of the crusts. These results demonstrate that the metabolic processes in BSCs differ depending on the type of organisms that form the crusts and that there is a high risk of C loss from Diploschistes BSCs after heavy rainfall events.

Moss-dominated soil crusts were first analyzed as moss tufts on soil, then the mosses were removed and the soil was analyzed separately to obtain the physiological response of both soil and individual moss stems. Net photosynthetic response of moss stems and complete crusts was decreased by insufficient and excess amounts of water, resulting in optimum curves with similar ranges of optimum water content. Light saturation of both sample types occurred at high irradiance, but moss stems reached light compensation and saturation points at lower values. Optimum temperatures of moss stems ranged between 22 and 27A degrees C, whereas complete crusts reached similar net photosynthesis between 7 and 27A degrees C. Under optimum conditions, moss stems reached higher net photosynthesis (4.0 vs. 2.8 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and lower dark respiration rates (-0.9 vs. -2.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Respiration rates of soil without moss stems were high (up to -2.0 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) causing by far lower absolute values of NP/DR ratios of soil crusts as compared to moss stems.

It is of global importance to understand the future of this extremely carbon-rich ecosystem in a warmer world and its role on global climate feedbacks. This study presents the result of the first in situ warming experiment in two Colombian paramos using Open-Top Chambers. We evaluated the response to warming of several ecosystem carbon balance-related processes, including decomposition, soil respiration, photosynthesis, plant productivity, and vegetation structure after 3 years of warming. We found that OTCs are an efficient warming method in the paramo, increasing mean air temperature by 1.7 degrees C and mean daytime temperature by 3.4 degrees C. The maximum air temperature differences between OTC and control was 23.1 degrees C. Soil temperature increased only by 0.1 degrees C. After 3 years of warming using 20 OTC (10 per paramo) in a randomized block design, we found no evidence that warming increased CO2 emissions from soil respiration, nor did it increase decomposition rate, photosynthesis or productivity in the two paramos studied. However, total C and N in the soil and vegetation structure are slowly changing as result of warming and changes are site dependent. In Sumapaz, shrubs, and graminoids cover increased in response to warming while in Matarredonda we observed an increase in lichen cover. Whether this change in vegetation might influence the carbon sequestration potential of the paramo needs to be further evaluated. Our results suggest that paramos ecosystems can resist an increase in temperature with no significant alteration of ecosystem carbon balance related processes in the short term. However, the long-term effect of warming could depend on the vegetation changes and how these changes alter the microbial soil composition and soil processes. The differential response among paramos suggest that the response to warming could be highly dependent on the initial conditions and therefore we urgently need more warming experiments in paramos to understand how specific site characteristics will affect their response to warming and their role in global climate feedbacks.",10.3389/fevo.2021.615006,2296-701X,NA,WOS:000624496500001,NA,NA,NA,615006,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,selected,unclear,n,n,"in situ and open top chambers for warming, tropical alpine system response to warming ",,

An increase in soil temperature in High Arctic regions may stimulate soil permafrost melting and microbial activity, thereby accelerating losses of greenhouse gases. It is therefore important to understand the factors regulating the rates of C turnover in polar soils. Consequently, our aims were to: (1) assess the concentration of low molecular weight (MW) dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in soil, (2) to investigate the temperature-dependent turnover of specific low MW compounds, and (3) to analyse the influence of substrate concentration on C cycling. Microbial mineralisation of labile low MW DOC in two High Arctic tundra soils was investigated using soil solutions spiked with either C-14-labelled glucose or amino acids. Spiked solutions were added to the top- and sub-soil from two ecosystem types (lichen and Carex dominated tundra), maintained at three temperatures (4-20 degrees C), and their microbial mineralisation kinetics monitored. (CO2)-C-14 evolution from the tundra soils in response to C-14-glucose and -amino acid addition could best be described by a double first order exponential kinetic equation with rate constants k(1) and k(2). Both forms of DOC had a short half-life (t(1/2)) in the pool of microbial respiratory substrate (t(1/2) = 1.07 +/- 0.10 h for glucose and 1.63 +/- 0.14 h for amino acids; exponential coefficient k(1) = 0.93 +/- 0.07 and 0.64 +/- 0.06 h(-1) respectively) whilst the second phase of mineralisation, assumed to be C that had entered the microbial biomass, was much slower (average k(2) = 1.30 x 10(-3) +/- 0.49 x 10(-4) h(-1)). Temperature had little effect on the rate of mineralisation of C-14 used directly as respiratory substrate. In contrast, the turnover rate of the C-14 immobilized in the microbial biomass prior to mineralisation was temperature sensitive (k(2) values of 0.99 x 10(-3) h(-1) and 1.66 x 10(-3) h(-1) at 4 and 20 degrees C respectively). Concentration-dependent glucose and amino acid miner lisation kinetics of glucose and amino acids (0-10 mM) were best described using Michaelis-Menten kinetics; there was a low affinity for both C substrates by the microbial community (K-m = 4.07 +/- 0.41 mM, V-max = 0.027 +/- 0.005 mmol kg(-1) h(-1)). In conclusion, our results suggest that in these C limiting environments the flux of labile, low MW DOC through the soil solution is extremely rapid and relatively insensitive to temperature. In contrast, the turnover of C incorporated into higher molecular weight microbial C pools appears to show greater temperature sensitivity. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The seasonal contributions of scaled up R(s-auto) adjusted for spatial representativeness (R(s-adj)) and P(ff) (P(ff-eco)) relative to that of total ecosystem respiration (R(e)) and photosynthesis (P(eco)), respectively, were also quantified. Shallow (5 cm) soil temperature explained 67-86\% of the variation in R(s-auto) for all ground cover types, while deeper (50 and 100 cm) soil temperatures were related to R(s-auto) only for the feathermoss micro-sites. Base respiration was consistently lower under feathermoss, intermediate under sphagnum, and higher under lichen during all three years. The R(s-adj/Re) ratio increased from spring through autumn and ranged from 0.85 to 0.87 annually for the snow-free period. The R(s-adj/Re) ratio was negatively correlated with the difference between air and shallow soil temperature and this correlation was more pronounced in autumn than summer and spring. Maximum photosynthetic capacity of the forest floor (P(ffmax)) saturated at low irradiance levels (similar to 200 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)) and decreased with increasing air temperature and vapor pressure deficit for all three ground cover types, suggesting that P(ff) was more limited by desiccation than by light availability. P(ffmax) was lowest for sphagnum, intermediate for feathermoss, and highest for lichen for two of the three years. P(ff) normalized for light peaked at air temperatures of 5-8 degrees C, suggesting that this is the optimal temperature range for P(ff).

The natural occurrence of CO2-concentrating mechanisms is negatively correlated with CO2 enrichment of aquatic habitats from respiration of organic C produced elsewhere and, less clearly, with low temperatures during the growing season, with low external pH, and with rapid water movement over the plant surface. Predictions based on laboratory data and on theoretical considerations as to the influence of light, nitrogen, and iron availability on the occurrence of CO2-concentrating mechanisms have yet to be rigorously tested in the field. The evolution of CO2-concentrating mechanisms is not well understood, but clearly the location of inorganic C pumps must have been influenced by successive symbiotic events.

Gas exchange and soil microenvironment measurements were made weekly between 14 June and 31 July 1990. The study communities included lichen-heath, a sparse community vegetated by lichens and dwarf ericaceous shrubs on rocky soils, moist Cassiope dwarf-shrub heath tundra, dominated by Carex and evergreen and deciduous shrubs on relatively deep organic soils, and dry Cassiope dwarf-shrub heath of stone-stripe areas, which was of intermediate character. Rates of CO2 efflux were similar for the three communities until mid-season when they peaked at rates between 4.9 and 5.9 g m(-2) d(-1). Following the midseason peak, the rates in all three communities declined, particularly in the lichen-heath. Seasonal patterns of CO2 efflux, soil temperature, and soil moisture suggest changing limitations to CO2 efflux over the course of the season. Rates of carbon dioxide efflux followed changes in soil temperature early in the season when soil moisture was highest. Mid-season efflux appeared to be limited by soil, moss, and lichen hydration until the end of July, when temperature again limited efflux. Differences between the communities were related to microenvironmental differences and probable differences in carbon quality.

These communities are a fundamental component of dryland ecosystems, and are critical to dryland carbon (C) cycling. To examine the effects of warming temperatures on soil C balance in a dryland ecosystem, we used infrared heaters to warm biocrust-dominated soils to 2 A degrees C above control conditions at a field site on the Colorado Plateau, USA. We monitored net soil exchange (NSE) of CO2 every hour for 21 months using automated flux chambers (5 control and 5 warmed chambers), which included the CO2 fluxes of the biocrusts and the soil beneath them. We observed measurable photosynthesis in biocrust soils on 12 \% of measurement days, which correlated well with precipitation events and soil wet-up. These days included several snow events, providing what we believe to be the first evidence of substantial photosynthesis underneath snow by biocrust organisms in drylands. Overall, biocrust soils in both control and warmed plots were net CO2 sources to the atmosphere, with control plots losing 62 +/- A 8 g C m(-2) (mean +/- A SE) over the first year of measurement and warmed plots losing 74 +/- A 9 g C m(-2). Between control and warmed plots, the difference in soil C loss was uncertain over the course of the entire year due to large and variable rates in spring, but on days during which soils were wet and crusts were actively photosynthesizing, biocrusts that were warmed by 2 A degrees C had a substantially more negative C balance (i.e., biocrust soils took up less C and/or lost more C in warmed plots). Taken together, our data suggest a substantial risk of increased C loss from biocrust soils with higher future temperatures, and highlight a robust capacity to predict CO2 exchange in biocrust soils using easily measured environmental parameters.",10.1007/s10533-015-0163-7,0168-2563,1573-515X,WOS:000366631500008,"Reed, Sasha C/ABE-9476-2020 Darrouzet-Nardi, Anthony/K-4054-2019","Reed, Sasha C/0000-0002-8597-8619 Darrouzet-Nardi, Anthony/0000-0002-2825-7962",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,selected,,n,n,no temperature dependent effects ,,

The trends in soil organic carbon (C) content and density were analyzed during this process. The sampling sites comprised a mobile dune (control) and those with algal, lichen, and moss crust-fixed sands. The desert soil CO2- and CH4-flux, temperature, and water content were measured from May to October in 2017 and 2018. Simultaneously, organic C content and density were measured and analyzed by stratification. Results The spatio-temporal variation in desert soil CO2-flux was apparent. The average CO2- fluxes in the control, algal, lichen, and moss sites were 1.67, 2.61, 5.83, and 6.84 mmol m(-2) h(-1), respectively, during the growing season, and the average CH4-fluxes in the four sites were - 1.13, - 1.67, - 3.66, and - 3.77 mu mol m(-2) h(-1), respectively. Soil temperature was significantly positively correlated with CO2-flux but could not influence CH4 absorption, and C flux had minimal correlation with soil water content. The soil total organic C density at all sites was significantly different and decreased as follows: moss > lichen > algal > control; moreover, it decreased with soil depth at all sites. The accumulation of desert soil organic C could enhance soil C emissions. Conclusion In a semi-arid desert, artificial planting could promote sand fixation and BSCs succession; therefore, increasing the C storage capacity of desert soils and decreasing soil C emissions could alter the C cycle pattern in desert ecosystems. Soil temperature is the major factor controlling desert soil CO2 flux and vegetation restoration, and BSCs development could alter the response patterns of C emissions to moisture conditions in desert soils. The results provide a scientific basis for studying the C cycle in desert ecosystems.",10.1186/s13021-021-00190-7,1750-0680,NA,WOS:000698101800001,NA,NA,NA,27,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,selected,,n,n,"BSCs, soil community responses",,

Scaling-up of the component fluxes to the stand level showed that the feather moss community accounted for more than 85\% of NFFE and SR, and more than 70\% of GFFP. The remainder was partitioned almost equally between the sphagnum and lichen communities for all components fluxes, while the exposed mineral soil in hollows accounted for less than 1\% of NFFE and SR. Soil temperature (T-s) was the dominant climate variable determining seasonal trends in NFFE and SR. The shape of the exponential response was, however, strongly modulated by soil water content (SWC) in the surface organic horizon, with reduced apparent temperature sensitivity at low SWC. A lowering of the water table depth also had an effect on NFFE and SR, although very weak, with increased CO2 loss from the hollows likely due to improved soil aeration. Air temperature (T-a) was the dominant climate variable determining seasonal trends in GFFP, while plant water status seemed to have played a minor role. Although not statistically significant (p = 0.9907), annual totals of scaled-up NFFE varied from 505 121 to 601 +/- 144g Cm-2 y(-1) over the 8-year period. The lowest NFFE was observed in 2004, the coldest and wettest year on record, while the highest was observed in 2005, a warmer year with slightly above-average precipitation. SR, by far the dominant component of the forest-floor CO2 exchange, closely followed the inter-annual trends in NFFE, while GFFP was lowest in 2004 and highest in 2003, also a cold year but with very low precipitation. Over the 8-year period, winter NFFE contributed 7\% to annual NFFE while GFFP during the growing season reduced losses due to SR by 18\%. While strong correlations were observed between the component fluxes and temperature (T-s or T-a) and SWC at the seasonal time scale, the mean annual values of these climate variables were poor predictors of the inter-annual trends when considered individually. Combining multiplicatively T-s and SWC for NFFE and SR, and T-a and SWC for GFFP, significantly increased the predictive ability of the models. The difference in predictability of the two time scales poses some interesting challenges for interpreting and modeling the long-term temporal trends in NFEE and its components. The results obtained in this relatively long-term study suggest that the inter-annual variability in the component fluxes was not driven by the mean annual climate conditions, but rather the shorter time scale changes in climate conditions, i.e. changes that occurred within days, weeks and/or seasons. Moreover, it appeared that the timing of the climatic changes within each year was also critical, spring and summer conditions having a far greater impact than fall and winter conditions in this stand.

Predicting abundance and richness patterns is difficult in many regions and especially so on the remote Antarctic continent, due to periods of snow cover, which limit remote sensing, and the small size of the biota present. As the Earth's coldest continent, temperature and water availability have received particular attention in understanding patterns of Antarctic biodiversity {[}2], whereas nitrogen availability has received less attention {[}3]. Nitrogen input by birds is a major nutrient source in many regions on Earth {[}4-7], and input from penguins and seals is associated with increased plant growth {[}8-10] and soil respiration {[}11-13] at some Antarctic locations.

In a dry continental treed bog, we compared three sites: control, recent (1-3 years; experimental) and older drained (10-13 years), with water levels at 38, 74 and 120 cm below the surface, respectively. At each site we measured carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and estimated tree root respiration (R-r; across hummock-hollow microtopography of the forest floor) and net primary production (NPP) of trees during the growing seasons (May to October) of 2011-2013. The CO2-C balance was calculated by adding the net CO2 exchange of the forest floor (NEff-R-r)to the NPP of the trees. From cooler and wetter 2011 to the driest and the warmest 2013, the control site was a CO2-C sink of 92, 70 and 76 g m(-2), the experimental site was a CO2-C source of 14, 57 and 135 g m(-2), and the drained site was a progressively smaller source of 26, 23 and 13 g CO2-C m(-2). The short-term drainage at the experimental site resulted in small changes in vegetation coverage and large net CO2 emissions at the microforms. In contrast, the longer-term drainage and deeper water level at the drained site resulted in the replacement of mosses with vascular plants (shrubs) on the hummocks and lichen in the hollows leading to the highest CO2 uptake at the drained hummocks and significant losses in the hollows. The tree NPP (including above-and below-ground growth and litter fall) in 2011 and 2012 was significantly higher at the drained site (92 and 83 g C m(-2)) than at the experimental (58 and 55 g C m(-2)) and control (52 and 46 g C m(-2)) sites. We also quantified the impact of climatic warming at all water table treatments by equipping additional plots with open-top chambers (OTCs) that caused a passive warming on average of similar to 1 degrees C and differential air warming of similar to 6 degrees C at midday full sun over the study years. Warming significantly enhanced shrub growth and the CO2 sink function of the drained hummocks (exceeding the cumulative respiration losses in hollows induced by the lowered water level x warming). There was an interaction of water level with warming across hummocks that resulted in the largest net CO2 uptake at the warmed drained hummocks. Thus in 2013, the warming treatment enhanced the sink function of the control site by 13 g m(-2), reduced the source function of the experimental by 10 g m(-2) and significantly enhanced the sink function of the drained site by 73 g m(-2). Therefore, drying and warming in continental bogs is expected to initially accelerate CO2-C losses via ecosystem respiration, but persistent drought and warming is expected to restore the peatland's original CO2-C sink function as a result of the shifts in vegetation composition and productivity between the microforms and increased NPP of trees over time.",10.5194/bg-12-1091-2015,1726-4170,1726-4189,WOS:000349794900012,"Munir, Tariq M/I-6886-2012 ","Munir, Tariq M/0000-0002-4591-0978 Strack, Maria/0000-0002-8996-7271 Perkins, Mendel/0000-0001-6767-2707",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,selected,,n,n,"in situ, lichen biomass, bog system ?",,

In the Kalahari of Botswana, soil crusts are predominantly made up of cyanobacteria, which when moist, are capable of fixing N and C. Many cyanobacteria also produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) which bind soil particles together and decrease erodibility. The physical integrity and metabolic activity of soil crusts is thus critical to ecological productivity, erodibility and CO2 fluxes in dryland regions. There are, however, few studies of the magnitude and controlling factors Of Soil CO2 flux within these systems. our aim was to quantify in Situ Soil CO2 flux during contrasting antecedent moisture conditions in the south west Kalahari of Botswana. We have designed a gas exchange chamber for field deployment coupled to a portable gas chromatograph, control and data logging instrumentation. The optical and active thermal control specifications of the chamber have been designed to permit photosynthesis and cope with the temperature extremes of the Kalahari whilst minimizing disturbance to the cyanobacteria soil crust. This approach has enabled CO2 fluxes to be monitored in situ with a high degree of precision for extended periods. In August 2005, when the surface and subsoils were dry, the ambient CO2 efflux was negative and low during the daytime (-6.15 mg C m(2) h(-1)). When 8 mm rainfall equivalent of water was added to the surface there was an immediate uptake of CO2 during the daytime at rates up to 75 mg C m(2) h(-1) demonstrating that rates of net photosynthesis are greatly enhanced by available moisture. In contrast, in May 2006 following a prolonged wet period when the subsoil was moist, there was a net positive efflux of CO2 from the soil at rates of up to 60 mg C m(2) h(-1) irrespective of whether the surface soil was moist or not. This is consistent with subsoil heterotrophic bacterial respiration becoming an important contributor to soil efflux. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To investigate the sensitivity of soil CO2 emissions to high temporal frequency variations in climate, we performed continuous monitoring of soil CO2 efflux using Forced Diffusion (FD) chambers at half-hour intervals, across three representative Alaskan soil cover types with underlying permafrost. These sites were established during the growing season of 2015, on the Seward Peninsula of western Alaska. Our chamber system is conceptually similar to a dynamic chamber, though FD is more durable and water-resistant and consumes less power, lending itself to remote deployments. We first conducted methodological tests, testing different frequencies of measurement, and did not observe a significant difference between collecting data at 30-min and 10-min measurement intervals (averaged half-hourly) (p < 0.001). Temperature and thaw depth, meanwhile, are important parameters in influencing soil carbon emission. At the study sites, we observed cumulative soil CO2 emissions of 62.0, 126.3, and 133.5 gCm(-2) for the growing period, in sphagnum, lichen, and tussock, respectively, corresponding to 83.8, 63.7, and 79.6\% of annual carbon emissions. Growing season soil carbon emissions extrapolated over the region equated to 0.17 +/- 0.06 MgC over the measurement period. This was 47\% higher than previous estimates from coarse-resolution manual chamber sampling, presumably because it better captured high efflux events. This finding demonstrates how differences in measurement method and frequency can impact interpretations of seasonal and annual soil carbon budgets. We conclude that annual CO2 efflux-measurements using FD chamber networks would be an effective means for quantifying growing and non-growing season soil carbon budgets, with optimal pairing with time-lapse imagery for tracking local and regional changes in environment and climate in a warming Arctic.

We are far from understanding the direct influence of cryptogamic covers on soil GHG fluxes, particularly in areas free of potential anthropogenic confounding factors. We assessed the role ofwell-developed cryptogamic covers in soil attributes, as well as in the in-situ exchange of GHG between Antarctic soils and the atmosphere during the austral summer. We found lower values of soil organic matter, total organic carbon, and total nitrogen in bare areas than in soils covered by mosses and, particularly, lichens. These differences, together with concomitant decreases and increases in soil temperature and moisture, respectively, resulted in increases in in-situ CO2 emission (i.e. ecosystem respiration) and decreases in CH4 uptake but no significant changes in N2O fluxes. We found consistent linear positive and negative relationships between soil attributes (i.e. soil organic matter, total organic carbon and total nitrogen) and CO2 emissions and CH4 uptake, respectively, and polynomial relationships between these soil attributes and net N2O fluxes. Our results indicate that any increase in the area occupied by cryptogams in terrestrial Antarctic ecosystems (due to increased growing season and increasingly warming conditions) will likely result in parallel increases in soil fertility as well as in an enhanced capacity to emit CO2 and a decreased capacity to uptake CH4. Suchchanges, unless offset by parallel C uptake processes, would represent a paradigmatic example of a positive climate change feedback. Further, we show that the fate of these terrestrial ecosystems under future climate scenarios, as well as their capacity to exchange GHG with the atmosphere might depend on the relative ability of different above-ground cryptogams to thrive under the new conditions.

Here we report how the CO2 gas exchange of the cyanobacteria-dominated biocrust type from Boodjamulla National Park in the north Queensland Gulf Savannah responds to the pronounced climatic seasonality and on their quality as a carbon sink using a semi-automatic cuvette system. The dominant cyanobacteria are the filamentous species Symplocastrum purpurascens together with Scytonema sp. Metabolic activity was recorded between 1 July 2010 and 30 June 2011, during which CO2 exchange was only evident from November 2010 until mid-April 2011, representative of 23.6\% of the 1-year recording period. In November at the onset of the wet season, the first month (November) and the last month (April) of activity had pronounced respiratory loss of CO2. The metabolic active period accounted for 25\% of the wet season and of that period 48.6\% was net photosynthesis (NP) and 51.4\% dark respiration (DR). During the time of NP, net photosynthetic uptake of CO2 during daylight hours was reduced by 32.6\% due to water supersaturation. In total, the biocrust fixed 229.09 mmolCO(2) m(-2) yr(-1), corresponding to an annual carbon gain of 2.75 gm(-2) yr(-1). Due to malfunction of the automatic cuvette system, data from September and October 2010 together with some days in November and December 2010 could not be analysed for NP and DR. Based on climatic and gas exchange data from November 2010, an estimated loss of 88 mmolCO(2) m(-2) was found for the 2 months, resulting in corrected annual rates of 143.1 mmolCO(2) m(-2) yr(-1), equivalent to a carbon gain of 1.7 gm(-2) yr(-1). The bulk of the net photosynthetic activity occurred above a relative humidity of 42 \%, indicating a suitable climatic combination of temperature, water availability and light intensity well above 200 mu mol photonsm 2 s(-1) photosynthetic active radiation. The Boodjamulla biocrust exhibited high seasonal variability in CO2 gas exchange pattern, clearly divided into metabolically inactive winter months and active summer months. The metabolic active period commences with a period of up to 3 months) of carbon loss, likely due to reestablishment of the crust structure and restoration of NP prior to about a 4-month period of net carbon gain. In the Gulf Savannah biocrust system, seasonality over the year investigated showed that only a minority of the year is actually suitable for biocrust growth and thus has a small window for potential contribution to soil organic matter.",10.5194/bg-15-491-2018,1726-4170,1726-4189,WOS:000423404400001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,selected,,n,n,"cyanobacteria, not lichen ",,

Blanket bogs, i.e. nutrient-poor peatlands restricted to maritime climates, may be extra vulnerable to global warming since they require a positive water balance to sustain their moss dominated vegetation and C sink functioning. This study presents a 4.5 year record of land-atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange from the Andoya blanket bog in northern Norway. Compared with other peatlands, the Andoya peatland exhibited low flux rates, related to the low productivity of the dominating moss and lichen communities and the maritime settings that attenuated seasonal temperature variations. It was observed that under periods of high vapour pressure deficit, net ecosystem exchange was reduced, which was mainly caused by a decrease in gross primary production. However, no persistent effects of dry conditions on the CO2 exchange dynamics were observed, indicating that under present conditions and within the range of observed meteorological conditions the Andoya blanket bog retained its C uptake function.

Recently, increasing studies have documented the significant instantaneous impacts of asymmetric warming on terrestrial vegetation growth, but the indirect effects of asymmetric warming carrying over vegetation growth (referred to here as time-lag effects) remain unknown. Here, we quantitatively studied the time-lag effects (within 1 year) of asymmetric warming on global plant biomes by using terrestrial vegetation net primary production (NPP) derived by the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model and accumulated daytime and nighttime temperature (ATmax and ATmin) from 1982 to 2013. Partial correlation and time-lag analyses were conducted at a monthly scale to obtain the partial correlation coefficients between NPP and ATmax/ATmin and the lagged durations of NPP responses to ATmax/ATmin. The results showed that (i) asymmetric warming has nonuniform time-lag effects on single plant biomes, and distinguishing correlations exist in different vegetation biomes' associations to asymmetric warming; (ii) terrestrial biomes respond to ATmax (4.63 +/- 3.92 months) with a shorter protracted duration than to ATmin (6.06 +/- 4.27 months); (iii) forest biomes exhibit longer prolonged duration in responding to asymmetric warming than nonforest biomes do; (iv) mosses and lichens (Mosses), evergreen needleleaf forests (ENF), deciduous needleleaf forests (DNF), and mixed forests (MF) tend to positively correlate with ATmax, whereas the other biomes associate with ATmax with near-equal splits of positive and negative correlation; and (v) ATmin has a predominantly positive influence on terrestrial biomes, except for Mosses and DNF.

While abiotic stress profoundly affects biotic interactions, their potential role as modulators of ecosystem responses to climate change is largely unknown. Using plants and biological soil crusts, we tested the relative importance of facilitative-competitive interactions and other community attributes (cover, species richness and species evenness) as drivers of ecosystem functioning along stress gradients in semi-arid Mediterranean ecosystems. Biotic interactions shifted from facilitation to competition along stress gradients driven by water availability and temperature. These changes were, however, dependent on the spatial scale and the community considered. We found little evidence to suggest that biotic interactions are a major direct influence upon indicators of ecosystem functioning (soil respiration, organic carbon, water-holding capacity, compaction and the activity of enzymes related to the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles) along stress gradients. However, attributes such as cover and species richness showed a direct effect on ecosystem functioning.

Recent work has reported on basic ecological parameters including distribution, abundance, and species composition of these algal (cyanobacterial)dominated crusts as well as on their photosynthetic rates in laboratory studies. As a step toward building an ecological model for a natural resource management plan, we determined the photosynthetic rate of the crusts under field environmental conditions. We examined the relationship between the environmental conditions of crust moisture content (MC), temperature, and ambient CO? concentration on photosynthetic rates during the mid-spring and the late autumn. Maximal photosynthetic rates (P-max), which did not vary greatly with season, were 3.57 and 3.99 mu mol CO2 M-2 s(-1) for crusts on dunes and in pans, respectively. Mean photosynthetic rates for three types of crust on dunes, smooth and flat, pedicillated, and unconsolidated, were 1.31, 1.47, and 1.29 mu mol CO2 M-2 s(-1), respectively. P-max of crusts on dunes and pans occurred at soil MCs of 110\% and 20\%, respectively, both lower and higher MCs resulted in decreased rates of photosynthesis. The relation between atmospheric CO2 concentration and net photosynthesis was linear (r(2) = 0.88 and 0.97 for crusts on dunes and pans, respectively) through at least 1000ppm CO2, We measured positive net photosynthesis at temperatures from 0 to 46 degrees C and found no clear optimum within this range when crusts were provided with optimal moisture and light conditions. Photosynthetic rates in this field study were somewhat lower than those measured in the laboratory, but both optimum MC and the relation between ambient CO2 and net photosynthetic rate were similar. Respiration rates were generally less than 10\% those of photosynthetic rates. Based on data herein and climatic information, we estimated the potential net primary productivity of crusts on dunes to be 11.7g Cm-2 yr(-1). The photosynthetic rate of the unconsolidated crust type, for which no data have been published, was similar to the other crust types. This finding, together with previous information that the chlorophyll values of this and other crust forms were similar, suggests that ecological studies, as well as conservation and restoration efforts, give these the same attention as the other crust types.

As cryptogams are poikilohydric organisms, they are physiologically active only under moist conditions. Thus, information on their water content (WC) as well as temperature and light conditions experienced by them are essential to analyze their impact on local, regional, and even global biogeochemical processes. In this study, we present data on the microclimatic conditions, including water content, temperature, and light conditions experienced by epiphytic bryophytes along a vertical gradient, and combine these with above-canopy climate data collected at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO) in the Amazonian rain forest between October 2014 and December 2016. While the monthly average of above-canopy light intensities revealed only minor fluctuations over the course of the year, the light intensities experienced by the bryophytes varied depending on the location within the canopy, probably caused by individual shading by vegetation. In the understory (1.5 m), monthly average light intensities were similar throughout the year, and individual values were extremely low, remaining below 3 mu mol(-1) m(-2) s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux density more than 84 \% of the time. Temperatures showed only minor variations throughout the year, with higher values and larger height-dependent differences during the dry season. The indirectly assessed water content of bryophytes varied depending on precipitation, air humidity, dew condensation, and bryophyte type. Whereas bryophytes in the canopy were affected by diel fluctuations of the relative humidity and condensation, those close to the forest floor mainly responded to rainfall patterns. In general, bryophytes growing close to the forest floor were limited by light availability, while those growing in the canopy had to withstand larger variations in microclimatic conditions, especially during the dry season. For further research in this field, these data may be combined with CO2 gas exchange measurements to investigate the role of bryophytes in various biosphere-atmosphere exchange processes, and could be a tool to understand the functioning of the epiphytic community in greater detail.",10.5194/bg-17-5399-2020,1726-4170,1726-4189,WOS:000592252700001,"Weber, Bettina/G-8316-2016 Moran-Zuloaga, Daniel/Q-9227-2019 Pohlker, Christopher/S-5207-2016 Moran-Zuloaga, Daniel/ABH-8378-2020 Andreae, Meinrat O/B-1068-2008 ","Weber, Bettina/0000-0002-5453-3967 Moran-Zuloaga, Daniel/0000-0002-1517-2732 Pohlker, Christopher/0000-0001-6958-425X Andreae, Meinrat O/0000-0003-1968-7925 Walter, David/0000-0001-6807-5007 Godoi, Ricardo H M/0000-0002-4774-4870 Ditas, Florian/0000-0003-3824-9373 Brill, Sebastian/0000-0002-8535-6182",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,selected,,n,n,epiphytic bryophytes ,,

Arctic ecosystems hold large stocks of potentially labile soil C and are dominated by plants with high root: shoot ratios. However, simple models of Arctic tundra ER typically use only aboveground drivers, such as air temperature and leaf area index. To investigate this apparent discrepancy, we partitioned ER into its component fluxes in moist acidic tussock tundra, which is among the most widespread of Arctic ecosystems. To partition ER, we combined tissue-scale measurements of leaf, wood, moss, lichen, and root respiration with seasonal biomass estimates. Simple respiration models were fit to the data for each tissue type. Our results suggest that belowground respiration is a large proportion of ER and that its contribution increases over the course of the growing season with soil thaw. We estimated that bulk soil heterotrophic respiration made up approximately 40 \%, root respiration made up 35 \%, mosses contributed 8.5 \% and all vascular plant leaves combined made up a mere 13.5 \% of ER during the 2012 growing season.

Selective cutting in the bilberry birch forests increases in 5-8 years the illumination under the canopy by 25-35 thous. lx, reduces the warming-up period of a soil root zone up to the root active temperature by 2 weeks, intensifies the root respiration rate of the overtopped spruce by 1.41.9 times. The illumination necessary for the efficient root activity of the overtopped spruce in the 53-, 59-years-old birch forests is reached by cutting of 50-52 \% of birch growing stock. Nitrogen fertilizers, applied in the lichen pine forests and bilberry birch forests, increase the root respiration rate of pine and spruce by 1.4-1.7 times and intensify physiological activity of a tree. The nitrogen dosage necessary for the efficient activity of the tree root systems is approximately 180 kg of the primary nutrient per 1 ha. Both the increase and deficiency of a nitrogen dosage under the normal climate conditions reduce the energy rate of pine and spruce roots, disturb the physiological activity and growth rate in the aboveground tree portions. In the rainy conditions they intensify CO2 releasing rate by the roots. Selective cutting in the bilberry birch forests intensifies the root activity of the overtopped spruce. Positive influence of nitrogen applied in the forest stands on the root respiratory metabolism as a result of the root competition for food is slightly reduced. According to the intensity of roots breathing, it is possible to define and set the parameters of thinning out of wood canopy and a dose of mineral feed for the highest productivity of plantings.",10.17238/issn0536-1036.2016.1.100,0536-1036,NA,WOS:000461066700009,"Zarubina, Liliya/AAG-8579-2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,excluded,tree root respiration -- not directly (if at all) involving lichens,n,n,,,

In this study we characterise the light and water content (WC) dependency of CO2 exchange for selected epilithic lichens in the laboratory and match this against samples monitored in their natural habitat by a novel, fully automatic cuvette. Laboratory measurements showed that, at a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 1500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), NP of the epilithic foliose lichen Xanthoria calcicola was reduced by about 85\% (compared to NP at optimal water content) when the thallus was suprasaturated (maximal hydration was defined as WC after spraying, submerging and subsequent removal of adhering water droplets by shaking). Only after loss of about 80\% of its maximal WC were the highest rates of NP possible. This depression was still substantial at 50 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD. Responses were similar for the crustose epilithic species Lecanora muralis. CO2 exchange of both lichens was monitored under natural conditions by means of the cuvette built into a man-made wall - a common habitat of the species - in the Botanical Garden, Wurzburg. For both species, rates of NP were low during and after heavy rain even if incident PPFD and temperature were favourable. This situation occurred frequently and could last through all daylight hours, resulting in a negative carbon balance when nocturnal rates of respiration were high. Often, after rainfall, there was a brief, high peak of NP when optimal WC was transiently attained before metabolic activity finally ceased through desiccation. Other periods with profitable rates of NP occurred after moderate moistening of the lichens by dew, fog or light rain. The lichens were found to perform identically in the field and laboratory. When the two data sets were compared it was clear that the full range of WC produced in the laboratory also occurred in nature and that the productivity of the epilithic lichens was regularly and severely limited by high WC. It is concluded that blockage of diffusive pathways for CO2 in the thallus through high water contents is an important ecological factor for productivity of these central European epi lithic lichens.",10.1007/BF00333209,0029-8549,NA,WOS:A1996VL38300002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,excluded,water content -- no temperature dependence,n,n,,,

As poikilohydric organisms, their activity time is often limited to short hydration events. The photosynthetic and respiratory response of biocrusts to hydration events is not only determined by the overall amount of available water, but also by the frequency and size of individual rainfall pulses. Methods: We experimentally assessed the carbon exchange of a biocrust community dominated by the lichen Diploschistes diacapsis in central Spain. We compared the effect of two simulated precipitation patterns providing the same overall amount of water, but with different pulse sizes and frequency (high frequency: five mm/day vs. low frequency: 15 mm/3 days), on net/gross photosynthesis and dark respiration. Results: Radiation and soil temperature, together with the watering treatment, affected the rates of net and gross photosynthesis, as well as dark respiration. On average, the low frequency treatment showed a 46\% +/- 3\% (mean +/- 1 SE) lower rate of net photosynthesis, a 13\% +/- 7\% lower rate of dark respiration, and a 24\% +/- 8\% lower rate of gross photosynthesis. However, on the days when samples of both treatments were watered, no differences between their carbon fluxes were observed. The carbon flux response of D. diacapsis was modulated by the environmental conditions and was particularly dependent on the antecedent soil moisture. Discussion: In line with other studies, we found a synergetic effect of individual pulse size, frequency, environmental conditions, and antecedent moisture on the carbon exchange fluxes of biocrusts. However, most studies on this subject were conducted in summer and they obtained results different from ours, so we conclude that there is a need for long-term experiments of manipulated precipitation impacts on the carbon exchange of biocrusts.

Recently, lichens and bryophytes have also been shown to release significant amounts of nitrous oxide. This finding relies on ecosystem-scale estimates of net primary productivity of lichens and bryophytes, which are converted to nitrous oxide emissions by empirical relationships between productivity and respiration, as well as between respiration and nitrous oxide release. Here we obtain an alternative estimate of nitrous oxide emissions which is based on a global process-based non-vascular vegetation model of lichens and bryophytes. The model quantifies photosynthesis and respiration of lichens and bryophytes directly as a function of environmental conditions, such as light and temperature. Nitrous oxide emissions are then derived from simulated respiration assuming a fixed relationship between the two fluxes. This approach yields a global estimate of 0.27 (0.19-0.35) (TgN(2)O) year(-1) released by lichens and bryophytes. This is lower than previous estimates but corresponds to about 50\% of the atmospheric deposition of nitrous oxide into the oceans or 25\% of the atmospheric deposition on land. Uncertainty in our simulated estimate results from large variation in emission rates due to both physiological differences between species and spatial heterogeneity of climatic conditions.

Lichens were studied when in equilibrium with the atmosphere as well as when moistened by snow showers. Photochemical quantum yield was estimated as DELTAF/F(m)' and related to thallus water content as well as microclimatic conditions. Lichens were photosynthetically active only when moistened by snow fall or by run-off from snow melt. The levels of photosynthetic activity in the field for all species were influenced by microenvironmental conditions and patterns in response were site and species specific. Highest levels of photosynthetic efficiency occurred when thalli were at intermediate water contents. Photosynthetic activity was reduced by cold as well as warm, bright conditions. Highest thallus water contents occurred during the middle of the day after substantial falls of snow. P. minuscula maintained highest thallus water contents at all sites and appears to have a high water compensation point which is related to its observed distribution patterns. Umbilicaria decussata studied in the laboratory did not become photosynthetically active even when exposed to 95\% relative humidity (RH) for 51 h and, when dehydrating after artificial wetting, showed an optimum thallus water content for photosynthesis of ca 90\% dry weight and a thallus water compensation point of about 35\% dry weight. In the field U. decussata did not become photosynthetically active except when moistened by snow. Usnea sphacelata exposed to the atmosphere had low thallus water contents (ca 30\%) which was not related to RH.

This is also the case for crustose lichens that are attached to the substrate, whether rocks or soil. While being verified during ample research on rock-dwelling lichens in the Negev, the findings from soil-dwelling lichens (lichen biocrusts) are not conclusive. In the Tabernas Desert, the soil surface is characterized by a lush cover of crustose lichens. These soil biocrusts (biological soil crusts) were reported to use dew for photosynthesis while, at the same time, it was also observed that these crustose chlorolichens are relatively non-wettable. In an attempt to explore the apparent controversy, two year-long meteorological data (minimum air temperature and relative humidity, RH), during which chlorolichens were thought to utilize dew for photosynthesis (2006-2007) were analyzed. The analysis includes a comparison to the meteorological conditions that prevailed in the Negev during 135 days of manual dew measurements. As found for the Negev, net photosynthesis by the chlorolichens is expected once the RH, as measured at the meteorological station, is =90\% while vapor condensation (dew) is expected once RH is >= 95\%. RH in the Negev was substantially higher than the average RH of 75.0-87.2\% registered during the rainless days of 2006-2007 in the Tabernas, implying that RH in the Tabernas is too low to facilitate frequent dew formation and net photosynthesis by the lichens. Photosynthesis in the Tabernas is mainly confined to rainy periods, taking place either due to direct wetting by rain, or following vapor condensation from the subsurface (distillation). Our findings do not support the view that dew is an important water source for the establishment and growth of crustose soil lichens in the Tabernas. Moreover, the low RH in the Tabernas may also imply that dew may only have a very limited role in providing water to lithobionts in this ecosystem.",10.2478/johh-2020-0034,NA,1338-4333,WOS:000582138000007,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,excluded,water availability of atmospheric humidity -- not relevant,n,n,,,

We also investigated carbon flux in biologically crusted soils after 0, 2, 5, and 15 mm precipitation treatments.

The average carbon flux rate and total carbon production increased exponentially with the precipitation amount.

These widespread communities in the intershrub spaces of drylands are able to use non-rainfall water inputs (NRWI) (fog, dewfall and water vapour) to become active and fix carbon dioxide (CO2), converting biocrusts into the main soil C contributors during periods in which vegetation remains inactive. In this study, we first evaluated the influence of biocrust type on NRWI uptake using automated microlysimeters, and second, we performed an outdoor experiment to examine how NRWI affected C exchange (photosynthesis and respiration) in biocrusts. NRWI uptake increased from incipient cyanobacteria to well-developed cyanobacteria and lichen biocrusts. NRWI triggered biocrust activity but with contrasting effects on CO2 fluxes depending on the main NRWI source. Fog mainly stimulated respiration of biocrust-covered soils, reaching net CO2 emissions of 0.68 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), while dew had a greater effect stimulating biocrust photosynthesis and resulted in net CO2 uptake of 0.66 mu mol m(-2) s(-1).

The FROSTFIRE burning experiment was executed in typical boreal forest from 8 to 15 July 1999. The forest fire significantly decreased soil CO2 and N2O emissions, by at most 50\%. On the contrary, CH4 flux from the soil increased from 7 to 142\%, suggesting that the forest fire plays a role in accelerative thawing of the frozen soil, and subsequently the release of CH4 from permafrost. Most of the CH4 was oxidized in the soil after the fire; however, some was released from the soil when the permafrost maximally thawed at the end of August 1999 and September 2000. Relationships between the fluxes of trace gases and soil temperature before and after the fire showed good exponential correlations, indicating that soil temperature was one of the factors determining the fluxes of trace gases on boreal forest soils. Also, the higher soil temperature after the fire may be led to the enhanced diffusion of CO2, CH4 and N2O by microbial activity between the atmosphere and the forest soils, and to the increased fluxes of trace gases in burned black spruce stand soils. In order to understand the roles of moss and lichen mats on the black spruce stands, the net respiration by mosses and lichens was estimated with light and dark chamber measurements. Net respiration corresponds to 42 to 58\% of the total soil respiration before fire. Therefore, the net respiration by moss and lichen layers was responsible for one-half of total soil CO2 emissions. The maximum regional net respiration rate by moss and lichen mats on black spruce forest floors of central Alaska was 0.018 +/- 0.009 GtC/yr, an important source of atmospheric CO2 in boreal forests. After the prescribed burn, soil respiration was attributable only to respiration by roots and microbes. The microbial respiration estimated after the fire is almost three times as high as that the calculated respiration before the fire. This finding indicates the post-fire condition may stimulate microbial respiration because of higher nutrients and substrates in remnant soils and enhanced soil temperature. The microbial respiration can be estimated 14.7 tC/ha in burned black spruce stands over a decade after the fire, suggesting burned black spruce forests in central Alaska are a crucial source of atmospheric CO2.",10.1029/2001JD000663,2169-897X,2169-8996,WOS:000181554600001,"Kim, Yongwon/F-4683-2010","Kim, Yongwon/0000-0002-6513-4777",NA,8154,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,excluded,not relevant -- forest fires effect on co2 fluxes in forests,n,n,,,

The method was applied to evaluate annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP) distribution in a boreal forest, interior Alaska, by accounting for net primary productivity (NPP) of the vegetation compositions and soil respiration observation synchronized to the spectral observation. Spectral reflectance and soil respiration were observed in two 30- m x 30- m plots in black spruce stands, central Alaska. Spectral characteristics of the forest floor and the needle leaves were used as input parameters of a radiative transfer model to evaluate nadir reflectances of spruce communities in relation to varying upper layer LAI, forest floor bryophyte types, and leaf spectral characteristics. Using the relationship, we obtained LAI and bryophyte area ratios for each pixel that corresponds to spruce forest on Landsat ETM + imagery. The LAI-NPP relationship of spruce forest was estimated from Plonski's {[}1981] normal yield table data and specific leaf area, and NPP was calculated from LAI. Observations of daily respiration were extrapolated to annual timescales using soil temperature. On the basis of the annual soil respiration and NPP of the upper layer and forest floor, annual NEP geographical distribution in a recent normal year was estimated from remotely sensed LAI and forest floor bryophyte area ratios.

Relatively favorable climatic conditions beyond the polar circle in summer are responsible for intensive soil respiration. The type of forest affects the emission of CO2 from the soil surface. The lowest rate of the CO2 emission is typical of the soils under lichen pine forest (105-220 mg C/(m(2) h) or 180 g C/m(2) during the summertime). Higher rates are observed for the soils under green moss pine (170-385 mg C/(m(2) h) or 360 g C/m(2) during the summertime) and birch (190-410 mg C/(m(2) h) or 470 g C/m(2) during the summertime) forests. This may related to a higher contribution of root respiration (44, 88, and 67\%, respectively). Soil respiration and the contribution of root respiration to it increase with an increase in the canopy density; mass of small roots; microbial biomass; depth of the stony layer; soil moistening; and the contents of available carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium compounds.

We measured Rs in three types of disturbed and undisturbed crusted soils (algae, lichen, and moss), as well as bare land from April to August, 2010, in Mu Us desert, northwest China. Rs was similar among undisturbed soils but increased significantly in disturbed moss and algae crusted soils. The variation of Rs in undisturbed and disturbed soil was related to soil bulk density. Disturbance also led to changes in soil organic carbon and fine particles contents, including declines of 60-70\% in surface soil C and N, relative to predisturbance values. Once BSCs were disturbed, Q(10) increased. Our findings indicate that a loss of BSCs cover will lead to greater soil C loss through respiration.

We also partitioned ER into aboveground and belowground components in all three communities. Belowground efflux was the dominant component of ER in the heath and meadow communities (63 percent and 88 percent of ER, respectively) but contributed only approximately 40 percent of ER in the shrub community.

A characteristic bimodal pore size distribution with a central depression around 0.05 mum of equivalent pore radius was obtained in all lichen samples. However, clear differences were found among the pore size distributions of each lichen taxa. The total thallus porosity was undoubtedly related to the anatomy of the medulla. In general, a radial plectenchymatic medulla conferred larger porosity to the thallus than an arachnoidal one. Maximum thallus water content closely depended on the total thallus porosity in the five lichens possessing rhizinomorphs. The species with a similar type of medulla could be grouped together in a multivariate analysis that considered three porosimetric parameters and the maximum thallus water content. Umbilicaria cinereorufescens was the most distinct species, with the lowest values of total porosity and water storage capacity and the largest value of thallus density, apparently due to its scleroplectenchymatic medulla.

Further analysis showed that net carbon exchange as well as ecosystem respiration were significantly correlated with the dwarf shrub cover, while the proportion of lichen cover (Cladina sp.) was not correlated with ecosystem carbon exchange. Clipping experiments showed that about half of the measured ecosystem respiration was heterotrophic. Plots that had been protected from reindeer grazing had almost two times higher above-ground plant biomass than grazed plots. The reason for this was 86\% lower lichen biomass on the grazed side of the fell, while the biomass of Ericaceous dwarf shrubs did not differ even though there were changes in species composition.

We quantified the CO2 exchange rates, i.e., CO2 assimilation and respiration, in samples from different microhabitats at two different sites in the Negev desert. In the successional pathway of the crust communities, the pioneers in colonising the soil surface are the cyanobacteria; green algae, mosses and lichens then follow. Physical influences such as soil structure and types, radiation intensity, and topographic traits such as slope directions that affect water availability and soil moisture, influence the successional pathways and the soil crust community. When physical conditions are the same, disturbances are key factors for a specific successional stage. We found a substantial gradient of CO2 exchange at the Nizzana site for both respiration and photosynthesis. Samples from the sand dunes at the Nizzana site showed a pronounced activity gradient with high rates for assimilation (around 70 mu mol CO2 m(-2) min(-1)) as well as respiration (60-70 pmol CO2 m(-2) min(-1)) at the base of dunes, decreasing towards the top. The soil crust samples of the Negev desert show comparable values. Hence, as ecotypes containing such biological soil crusts with dominant photosynthetically active organisms are a widespread phenomenon in desert, boreal and arctic systems, their contribution to the global cycling of trace gases and elements can be significant for global budgets.

Here, CO2 efflux measurements using a manual chamber system within a 40m x 40m (5m interval; 81 total points) plot were conducted within dominant tundra vegetation on the Seward Peninsula of Alaska, during the growing seasons of 2011 and 2012, for the assessment of driving parameters of CO2 efflux. We applied a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) model - a function of soil temperature, soil moisture, vegetation type, and thaw depth - to quantify the effects of environmental factors on CO2 efflux and to estimate growing season CO2 emissions. Our results showed that average CO2 efflux in 2011 was 1.4 times higher than in 2012, resulting from the distinct difference in soil moisture between the 2 years. Tussock-dominated CO2 efflux is 1.4 to 2.3 times higher than those measured in lichen and moss communities, revealing tussock as a significant CO2 source in the Arctic, with a wide area distribution on the circumpolar scale. CO2 efflux followed soil temperature nearly exponentially from both the observed data and the posterior medians of the HB model. This reveals that soil temperature regulates the seasonal variation of CO2 efflux and that soil moisture contributes to the interannual variation of CO2 efflux for the two growing seasons in question. Obvious changes in soil moisture during the growing seasons of 2011 and 2012 resulted in an explicit difference between CO2 effluxes - 742 and 539 gCO(2) m(-2) period(-1) for 2011 and 2012, respectively, suggesting the 2012 CO2 emission rate was reduced to 27\%(95\% credible interval: 17-36\%) of the 2011 emission, due to higher soil moisture from severe rain.

Field layer CO2 efflux was significantly higher in grazed areas. The field layer was a CH4 sink in all areas, but grazed areas absorbed more CH4 compared to non-grazed areas. Although total N2O fluxes remained around 0 in grazed areas, a small N2O sink occurred in non-grazed areas with lower moss biomass.

Nidicolous larvae overwinter beneath snow, reaching metamorphosis without feeding after 395 d, the longest development time known for an endotrophic anuran. However, a few clutches develop more quickly and metamorphose before winter. This study examines the effect of temperature on development time and energy expenditure by measuring temperatures and developmental stages in field nests as well as rates of oxygen consumption ((V) over dot O-2), developmental stage, body mass, and energy content in the laboratory at three relevant temperatures (5 degrees, 10 degrees, 15 degreesC). Eggs and larvae reared at 5 degreesC differentiated very slowly, and their development time far exceeded those in natural nests, but development times at 107 and 15 degreesC averaged 277 and 149 d, respectively, and were shorter than field incubation times. Generally, respiration rates of aquatic hatchlings were low in comparison with other species but increased with larval age and jumped about 25\% higher near metamorphosis when larvae were able to air breathe. The mean energy density was 26.0 J mg(-1) for the dry ova and 20.6 J mg(-1) for a dry gut-free froglet, and total production efficiency was 61.5\%. We developed a model based on the relationships between incubation temperature and (V) over dot O-2 to estimate the respiratory cost of development to metamorphosis, the first such study for an amphibian. The cost was 177 J at 15 degreesC, 199 J at 10 degreesC, and at least 249 J at 5 degreesC, and we predicted that continual development at 5 degreesC would lead to premature yolk depletion because it equalled the 249 J contained in fresh ova. Continuously logged field-nest temperatures and interpolation of laboratory data provided estimates of development rates, (V) over dot O-2, and respiratory energy costs in field nests. Development to metamorphosis required between 185 and 234 J when larvae overwintered, but completion of metamorphosis before winter saved 123 J. However, the advantage of emergence in warmer months, when conditions are suitable for feeding and growth, may offset the greater energy cost of overwintering.",10.1086/318097,1522-2152,NA,WOS:000166172300018,"Mitchell, Nicola J/K-5277-2012 Mitchell, Nicola/AAE-4132-2020 Seymour, Roger/C-3469-2009","Mitchell, Nicola J/0000-0003-0744-984X Seymour, Roger/0000-0002-3395-0059",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,excluded,"not relevant, lichen used as nesting structure for frog eggs, study measure frogs legs",n,n,,,

The light/temperature response of photosynthesis is such that under the prevailing climatic regime on the island the lichen, if sufficiently hydrated, would exhibit near-maximal photosynthesis rates for 75\% of the photoperiod over the year. A photosynthetic response model predicts that the lichen's net annual carbon acquisition is 3.1 g C g(-1) year(-1) under the current solar radiation and temperature regime at the island. The model predicts that changes in temperature and radiation by the amounts known to have occurred in the past few decades, and even greater changes (temperature increase by up to 2 degreesC, radiation by up to 10\%), would negligibly affect the annual amount of carbon acquired provided the thalli remain hydrated. Incorporating hydration/desiccation cycles into the model resulted in a substantial lowering of annual net C exchange.

These substrates mostly contain few organic matter and, hence, are nutrient poor. Accumulation of soil carbon is, an important factor for ecosystem development, where biological soil crusts initially influence soil processes and promote ecosystem succession. The compositional structures of biological soil crusts at various developmental stages and their photosynthetic properties were investigated on two former open-cast lignite sites, currently under reclamation, an artificial sand dune in Welzow Sud, and a forest plantation in Schlabendorf Sud (Brandenburg, Germany). As development of biological soil crusts progressed, their contents of organic carbon and total chlorophyll increased. The ratio of these parameters, however, varied with the relative contribution of lichens and mosses in particular. Also maximum photochemical efficiency, net photosynthesis and respiration increased with crustal development. An additional evaluation of NDVI and chlorophyll fluorescence images showed that especially moss-dominated biocrusts had higher photosynthetic capacity compared to green algae-dominated biocrusts or soil lichens, so the photosynthetic capacity showed to be highly species-specific. The ratio of gross photosynthesis to respiration indicated a higher ecological efficiency of biocrusts dominated by green algae than of lichen-dominated biocrusts. The occurrence of soil lichens reduced net CO2 fixation and increased CO2 release due to the enhanced mycobiontic respiration. During crustal succession, the rise of photosynthesis-related parameters is not necessarily linear as a result of the highly heterogenic distribution of the different crustal organisms between biocrusts of similar developmental stages as well as between those growing at the two study sites. Therefore, the evaluation of relevant ecophysiological parameters highlighted that not all biocrust-forming organisms similarly contribute to the ecophysiological behavior of biological soil crusts. Nevertheless, the occurrence of the biological soil crusts promoted soil formation and accumulation of soil carbon in initial soils. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

With the expected increase in fire frequency, the greenhouse gas (GHG) budget of boreal forest soils may change. In order to understand the long-term nature of the soil-atmosphere GHG exchange after fire, we established a fire chronosequence representing successional stages at 8, 19, 34, 65, 76 and 179 years following stand-replacing fires in hemiboreal Scots pine forests in Estonia. Changes in extracellular activity, litter decomposition, vegetation biomass, and soil physicochemical properties were assessed in relation to carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Soil temperature was highest 8 years after fire, whereas soil moisture varied through the fire chronosequences without a consistent pattern. Litter decomposition and CO2 efflux were still lower 8 years after fire compared with pre-fire levels (179 years after fire). Both returned to pre-fire levels before vegetation re-established, and CO2 efflux was only strongly responsive to temperature from 19 years after fire onward. Recovery of CO2 efflux in the long term was associated with a moderate effect of fire on enzyme activity, the input of above- and below-ground litter carbon, and the re-establishment of vegetation. Soil acted as a CH4 sink and N2O source similarly in all successional stages. Compared with soil moisture and time after fire, soil temperature was the most important predictor for both GHGs. The re-establishment of overstorey and vegetation cover (mosses and lichens) might have caused an increase in CH4 and N2O effluxes in the studied areas, respectively. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

Here we show that they are also greenhouse gas sources with large nitrous oxide (N2O) and small methane (CH4) emissions. Whilst N2O emission rates varied with temperature, humidity, and N deposition, an almost constant ratio with respect to respiratory CO2 emissions was observed for numerous lichens and bryophytes. We employed this ratio together with respiration data to calculate global and regional N2O emissions. If our laboratory measurements are typical for lichens and bryophytes living on ground and plant surfaces and scaled on a global basis, we estimate a N2O source strength of 0.32-0.59 Tg year(-1) for the global N2O emissions from cryptogamic covers. Thus, our emission estimate might account for 4-9\% of the global N2O budget from natural terrestrial sources. In a wide range of arid and forested regions, cryptogamic covers appear to be the dominant source of N2O.

To simulate the diurnal and seasonal dynamics of F-S, the modelling considered simultaneously the CO2 production, transport and surface exchanges (e.g. biocrust photosynthesis, respiration and photodegradation). The model was parameterized and validated with multivariate data measured during the years 2013-2014 in a semiarid shrubland ecosystem in Yanchi, northwestern China. The model simulation showed that soil rewetting could enhance CO2 dissolution and delay the emission of CO2 produced from rooting zone. In addition, an ineligible fraction of respired CO2 might be removed from soil volumes under respiration chambers by lateral water flows and root uptakes. During rewetting, the lichen-crusted soil could shift temporally from net CO2 source to sink due to the activated photosynthesis of biocrust but the restricted CO2 emissions from subsoil. The presence of plant cover could decrease the root-zone CO2 production and biocrust C sequestration but increase the temperature sensitivities of these fluxes. On the other hand, the sensitivities of root-zone emissions to water content were lower under canopy, which may be due to the advection of water flows from the interspace to canopy. To conclude, the complexity and plant-interspace heterogeneities of soil C processes should be carefully considered to extrapolate findings from chamber to ecosystem scales and to predict the ecosystem responses to climate change and extreme climatic events.

The model, driven by daily weather conditions, simulated daily soil climate status (temperature and moisture profiles), spruce photosynthesis and respiration, moss photosynthesis and respiration, and litter decomposition. Model agreement with preliminary field data was good for net ecosystem exchange (NEE), capturing both the asymmetrical seasonality and short-term variability. During the growing season simulated daily NEE ranged from -4 g C m(-2) d(-1) (carbon uptake by ecosystem) to +2 g C m(-2) d(-1) (carbon flux to atmosphere), with fluctuations from day to day. In the early winter simulated NEE values were +0.5 g C m(-2) d(-1), dropping to +0.2 g C m(-2) d(-1) in mid-winter. Simulated soil respiration during the growing season (+1 to +5 g C m(-2) d(-1)) was dominated by metabolic respiration of the live moss, with litter decomposition usually contributing less than 30\% and live spruce root respiration less than 10\% of the total. Both spruce and moss net primary productivity (NPP) rates were higher in early summer than late summer. Simulated annual NEE for 1994 was -51 g C m(-2) y(-1), with 83\% going into tree growth and 17\% into the soil carbon accumulation. Moss NPP (58 g C m(-2) y(-1)) was considered to be litter (i.e. soil carbon input; no net increase in live moss biomass).

We measured net carbon fluxes (NCF) in soil with four cover types (moss crusted soil, cyanobacteria/lichen crusted soil, bareland and semishrub Ephedra distachya-inhabited site) from April to October of 2010 and 2011, and NCF and dark respiration (DR) after four rainfall amounts (0, 2, 5, and 15 mm) in cyanobacteria/lichen crusted soil, bareland and the E. distachya-inhabited site. NCF in the E. djstachya-inhabited site differed significantly from those of the other three soil cover types, while no difference was observed between the moss and cyanobacteria/ lichen crusted soils or between the two crusted soils and bareland on most measurement occasions. NCF ranged from 0.28 +/- 0.14 to 1.2 +/- 0.07 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in the biologically crusted soils, and from 2.2 0.27 to 0.46 0.03 mu mol IT1-2 s(-1) at the E. distachya-inhabited site. Daily NCF in the biologically crusted soils and bareland showed carbon release at most times and total carbon production ranged from 48.8 5.4 gC m(-2) yr(-1) to 50.9 +/- 3.8 gC m(-2) yr(-1), while the E. distachya-inhabited site showed a total carbon uptake of 57.0 +/- 9.9 gC m(-2) yr(-1). Daily variances in NCF were well-explained by variances in surface soil temperature, and seasonal NCF showed a significant linear relationship with soil moisture in the two biologically crusted soils and bareland when soil volumetric water content was less than 3\%. Rainfall elicited intense carbon release in cyanobacteria/lichen crusted soil, bareland and at the E. distachya-inhabited site, and both NCF and DR were positive in the first two days after rainfall treatments. Mean NCF and DR were not different between rainfall amounts of 2, 5 and 15 mm in cyanobacteria/lichen crusted soil and bareland, while they were significantly higher after 15 mm rainfall treatment compared with 2 mm and 5 mm treatments at the E. distachya-inhabited site. Mean NCF and DR in the first two days increased logistically with rainfall amount. Based on our findings, we suggest that E. distachya-inhabited sites contribute to carbon uptake in the Gurbantunggute Desert, while biologically crusted soils exhibit carbon release for most of the year. Even though photosynthesis immediately following rainfall can be stimulated, carbon uptake effect in biologically crusted soil is likely intermittent and confined to periods when moisture is available.

We examined gas exchange of biological soil crusts (biocrusts), the underlying soil biotic community, and the belowground respiratory activity of C-3 and C-4 grasses over 2 years in southeast Utah, USA. We used soil surface CO2 flux and the amount and carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) of soil CO2 as indicators of belowground and soil surface activity. Soil respiration was always below 2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and highly responsive to soil moisture. When moisture was available, warm spring and summer temperature was associated with higher fluxes. Moisture pulses led to enhanced soil respiration lasting for a week or more. Biological response to rain was not simply dependent on the amount of rain, but also depended on antecedent conditions (prior moisture pulses). The short-term temperature sensitivity of respiration was very dynamic, showing enhancement within 1-2 days of rain, and diminishing each day afterward. Carbon uptake occurred by cyanobacterially dominated biocrusts following moisture pulses in fall and winter, with a maximal net carbon uptake of 0.5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), although typically the biocrusts were a net carbon source. No difference was detected in the seasonal activity of C-3 and C-4 grasses, contrasting with studies from other arid regions (where warm-versus cool-season activity is important), and highlighting the unique biophysical environment of this cold desert.

Our objectives were to quantify the impact of 21 years of large herbivore and large and small herbivore exclusion on carbon cycling during peak growing season in a dry heath tundra community. When herbivores were excluded, we observed a significantly greater leaf area index as well as greater vascular plant abundance. While we did not observe significant differences in deciduous dwarf shrub abundance across treatments, evergreen dwarf shrub abundance was greater where large and small herbivores were excluded. Both foliose and fruticose lichen abundance were higher in the large herbivore, but not the small and large herbivore exclosures.

In continental lichen heaths in the inland with nutrient-poor conditions, however, slowly decomposable dwarf shrubs are favoured by grazing. According to a hypothesis, by favouring easily decomposing plants in nutrient-rich conditions and slowly decomposing plants in nutrient-poor conditions, herbivory enhances soil nutrient cycling in nutrient-rich and retards it in nutrient-poor areas. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the impact of reindeer grazing on soil C and N mineralization between two oceanic and two continental arctic-alpine tundra heaths. Although soil respiration and microbial metabolic activity were enhanced by grazing in the suboceanic but not in the subcontinental tundra heaths, gross N mineralization rates were higher in the grazed areas in soils from all study sites, indicating that reindeer grazing leads to increased rates of nutrient cycling in both nutrient-poor and nutrient-rich tundra heaths. Thus, in the subcontinental tundra heaths, the increase in soil N concentrations due to mammalian waste products enhances N mineralization rates, even though the organic C quality is not improved by reindeer grazing.

Soils in these polar environments frequently contain large stocks of proteinaceous organic matter, which has decomposed slowly due to low temperatures. In addition to proteins, considerable quantities of D-amino acids and their peptides enter soil from bacteria and lengthy residence times can lead to racemisation of L-amino acids in stored proteins. It has been predicted that climate warming in polar environments will lead to increased rates of soil organic N turnover (i.e. amino acids and peptides of both enantiomers). However, our understanding of organic N breakdown in these soils is very limited. To address this, we tested the influence of chain length and enantiomeric composition on the rate of breakdown of amino acids and peptides in three contrasting tundra soils formed under the grass, moss or lichen-dominated primary producer communities of Signy Island in the South Orkney Islands. Both D- and L-enantiomers of the amino acid monomer were rapidly mineralized to CO2 at rates in line with those found for L-amino acids in many other terrestrial ecosystems. In all three soils, L-peptides were decomposed faster than their amino acid monomer, suggesting a different route of microbial assimilation and catabolism. D-peptides followed the same mineralization pattern as L-peptides in the two contrasting soils under grass and lichens, but underwent relatively slow decomposition in the soil underneath moss, which was similar to the soil under the grass. We conclude that the decomposition of peptides of L-amino acids may be widely conserved amongst soil microorganisms, whereas the decomposition of peptides of D-amino acids may be altered by subtle differences between soils. We further conclude that intense competition exists in soil microbial communities for the capture of both peptides and amino acids produced from protein breakdown. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The possibility of regulating their intensity by additional introduction of nitrogen fertilizer has been determined. It has been found that on hydromorphic excessively wet soils of the North, seasonal height growth of pine occurs with a maximum rate in late June and early July, when air temperature rises and the root system is released from excessive moisture. Unlike lichen pine forests, in which pine roots are not affected by flooding, on hydromorphic peat soils pine grows much slower and during the growing season has less intensive physiological processes. The low rate of shoot growth and physiological processes in pine in sphagnum forest site conditions is explained by dysfunction of its root system as a result of soil anoxia caused by flooding, as well as by insufficient supply of growing shoots with macronutrients from the crown as a result of violation of their normal outflow and movement in the tree. Nitrogen fertilizers positively affect growth and physiological processes in pine trees in sphagnum forest types. However, their effect in these forest site conditions is much weaker than in the dry lichen forests of the Far North. On water-logged peat soils under the influence of nitrogen fertilizer seasonal height growth of pine trees increases by 20 \%, the duration of seasonal shoot growth increases by 8-10 days, the intensity of photosynthesis increases significantly, and, as a result of reduced water consumption for transpiration, the tree water regime normalizes and the transpiration productivity increases.

One sandbox is planted with pine trees, another with grass, and the third is left ``bare{''} (actually it is covered sporadically by bryophytes and lichens). Results show linear correlations, independent of discharge, between the concentrations of dissolved Na+ and K+ on the one hand and Ca++ and Mg++ on the other for all three sandboxes. No correlations between singly charged and doubly charged cations were found. These correlations are interpreted to represent cation exchange equilibria between soil waters and clay minerals plus soil organic matter. The correlation slope, representing the exchange constant, for Na vs K is different for the pine-covered sandbox than for the other two whereas for Ca vs Mg the correlation is independent of the presence or absence of trees. We interpret this as representing a shift of cation exchange equilibria in the pine sandbox by the activities of growing trees. Concentrations of Na, K, Ca, Mg, and H4SiO4 from the barren and grass-lined sandboxes were found to vary seasonally with a marked sinusoidal pattern which was independent of the discharge from each sandbox. (The discernment of a similar pattern in the tree lined sandbox was difficult due to a lack of discharge over much of the year.) Concentration maxima occurred in August and minima in February, and there is a close parallelism with soil temperature. We interpret this as representing temperature induced variations in cation exchange equilibria and silica adsorption. Independence from highly varying water discharge, e.g.,. that accompanying severe rainstorms, indicates rapidly re-attained equilibrium. Variations in the concentrations of cations are likely due to exchange with unmeasured cations, probably H+ or dissolved Al species, as a result of possible seasonal changes in internal acid production and external input of acid rain to the sandboxes. Internal production may represent a response to seasonal changes in respiration rate as it responds to seasonally varying temperature. Added to this is the effect of temperature on exchange equilibrium. Seasonal variations in dissolved silica are most likely due to the dependence of adsorption/desorption equilibria on temperature.

However, studies on the soil CO2 efflux from them are still limited, especially deglaciated area due to the Arctic warming. The ecosystem in Ny-Alesund, Svalbard, Norway (similar to 79 degrees N) has gradually undergone substantial alterations due to deglaciation induced by climate change, where biological soil crusts (BSCs, mainly consisting of cyanobacteria, algae, lichen, and bryophytes, etc. on the soil surface) are widely formed in the glacier foreland and further developed especially in the later stages of primary succession. In this study, soil CO2 efflux from partly or totally covered with black-colored BSCs (BSCs-B) was measured from 2007 to 2009 using portable dynamic chamber system. The objectives of this study were (i) to quantify the CO2 efflux from the soil, (ii) to examine the controlling factors which affect the temporal and spatial variation of soil CO2 efflux, (iii) to examine the contribution of BSCs-B to soil CO2 efflux, and (iv) to estimate the relationship between soil CO2 efflux and microbial activity to evaluate its role on the surface carbon budget at deglaciated area. It was found that the emission of soil CO2 from BSCs-B was consistent through the long-term in situ measurement in the high arctic tundra. Soil CO2 efflux ranged from 0.3 to 0.7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) with means of 0.56 (+/- 0.07) mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in 2007, 0.54 (+/- 0.13) mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in 2008, and 0.51 (+/- 0.09) mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in 2009. The soil temperature (Ts) explained 50-70\% of the temporal variation of the soil CO2 efflux when temperature ranged from 6 to 12 degrees C, whereas Ts is not controlling factor for spatial variation of soil CO2 efflux considering the low coefficient of variation (CV). In the meanwhile, soil water content (SWC) was not a main controlling factor for temporal variation of soil CO2 efflux. Even though CV of SWC was not low, spatial variation of SWC could not explain that of soil CO2 efflux. The soil CO2 efflux was spatially affected by BSCs-B coverage, amount of pebble, and the nearby vegetation distribution. All enzyme activities exhibited significantly higher values in BSCs-B than in mineral soil of BSCs (p<0.01). The activities of enzymes in BSCs-B generally exhibited positive correlations with the soil CO2 efflux except for humic substances (R-2=0.52). It can be concluded that the magnitude of the soil CO2 efflux from BSCs-B is comparable to those from moss and vascular plants in the surface carbon budget. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In biological soil crusts (BSCs), the description of ecophysiological features is difficult, due to the high variability in taxonomic composition and variable methodologies applied. Especially for BSCs in early successional stages, the available datasets are rare or focused on individual constituents, although these crusts may represent the only photoautotrophic component in many heavily disturbed ruderal areas, such as parking lots or building areas with increasing surface area worldwide. We analyzed the response of photosynthesis and respiration to changing BSC water contents (WCs), temperature and light in two early successional BSCs. We investigated whether the response of these parameters was different between intact BSC and the isolated dominating components. BSCs dominated by the cyanobacterium Nostoc commune and dominated by the green alga Zygogonium ericetorum were examined. A major divergence between the two BSCs was their absolute carbon fixation rate on a chlorophyll basis, which was significantly higher for the cyanobacterial crust. Nevertheless, independent of species composition, both crust types and their isolated organisms had convergent features such as high light acclimatization and a minor and very late-occurring depression in carbon uptake at water suprasaturation. This particular setup of ecophysiological features may enable these communities to cope with a high variety of climatic stresses and may therefore be a reason for their success in heavily disturbed areas with ongoing human impact. However, the shape of the response was different for intact BSC compared to separated organ-isms, especially in absolute net photosynthesis (NP) rates.

After layer-by-layer (LBL) coating, the NPs showed desired serum stability to enhance tumor accumulation. Upon tumor-site-specific NIR light (808 nm) irradiation, the nonlethal temperature elevation cleaved the Fe-CO bond to release CO. CO then expedited mitochondrial metabolic exhaustion to block ATP synthesis and inhibit ATP-dependent drug efflux, thus reversing MDR of the Dox-resistant MCF-7/ADR tumors to potentiate the anticancer efficacy of Dox.

Diurnal courses of lichen gas exchange response were recorded over five-day periods during the arctic summer and fall (from July to early September 1988 and 1989). Water availability is the environmental factor of foremost importance in determining rates of primary production. Water sources were rain, fog, and dew fall, as well as high air humidity, which alone could reactivate most of the green algal species after desiccation. Despite high variability in environmental conditions, certain patterns in the diurnal course of thallus hydration occurred repeatedly, so that five different weather types were defined within which gas exchange performance was predictable. Even short periods of favourable hydration were used by lichens for positive net photosynthesis (NP). There was no indication of adverse consequences of `'resaturation respiration''. Even after a dry period of 3 days, sudden rehydration resulted in carbon gain without delay. For short periods of time, the combinations of water content, temperature and light imposed on the lichens enables high rates of NP. Individual species differed greatly in their maximal NP rate, which correlated with chlorophyll and nitrogen content. At favourable times in the field, observed NP rates approached the maximum capacity found in laboratory experiments at natural ambient CO2. Often with sufficient hydration, carbon gain was limited by light. CO2 exchange became negative even during daylight hours due to the effects of fog and clouds with light below compensation levels. Reduced but still positive rates of NP were observed with snow and with frozen lichens. In order to draw general conclusions about activity over the summer season, the time was calculated for a characteristic set of sampling days during which thalli were inactivated due to dehydration (no CO2 exchange measurable), during which they photosynthetically fixed CO2, and during which CO2 was released. The thalli were inactivated on the average 42.5\% of the time. Species-specific differences with respect to the total period of dehydration were surprisingly small (from 39.0\% for Stereocaulon alpinum to 45.5\% for Cetraria cucullata). Thus, growth-form specific morphology and anatomy of the samples, which were exposed side-by-side at the same site did not result in large differences in active phases. On the other hand, differences in physiological traits between species result in varying division of active phases with respect to positive and negative NP. For example, Dactylina arctica photosynthesized 1.36 times longer than Peltigera malacea. Other traits tend to offset the negative effect of long periods with respiratory CO2 release. As a result, the cyanobacterial lichen Peltigera malacea with the shortest total period of positive NP was, nevertheless, the most productive species due to its high photosynthetic capacity. Our field observations strengthen the viewpoint that studies of lichen physiological differentiation are essential for understanding species autecology and that approaches based on interpretation of morphological attributes may sometimes be exaggerated in their importance.",NA,0367-2530,NA,WOS:A1993LC48100009,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,selected,,,,,,

FIELD-MEASUREMENTS OF MICROCLIMATE, WATER RELATIONS AND CO2-EXCHANGE",FLORA,1991,185,2,73-97,NA,"In its natural habitat of stabilized dunes on the island Baltrum (North Sea), microclimatic conditions for Cladonia portentosa were recorded (air and thallus temperature, rel. humidity, photosynthetically active radiation).  In parallel, water content of the lichen (WG, \% of dry weight) was determined.  With respect to lichen hydration, the 56 diurnal courses of measurements, which were spread over several seasons, could be grouped into 5 different types:  (1) WG continuously low; (2) nocturnal moistening (e.g. by dew fall) and high WG at sunrise; (3) days with fog and high WG throughout; (4) days with rain and long lasting high WG; (5) lichens covered by snow. In addition, during 24 days in the summer and in the winter, diurnal courses of CO2 exchange of the lichen were followed together with the WG and the microclimatic conditions.  These days could be separated according to with the above types.  This provides an overview for the performance in production ecology of the lichen. The range of water content of the lichen was measured from 7\% to > 500\%.  Cladonia portentosa was able to absorb water vapor quickly from the atmosphere, however, dew, mist, and rain were the main sources for hydration.  At a WG between 150 and 180\% and under sufficient light, the lichen reached its optimum of net photosynthesis (NP), higher degrees of hydration resulted in a slight depression.  The moisture compensation point (FKP) of NP was lower in summer (around 20\% WG) than in winter (25-35\% WG), due to temperature conditions.  Also under field conditions, the lichen maintained photosynthetic activity at temperatures below 0-degrees-C.  With optimal conditions (120-200\% WG, 17-19-degrees-C, 500-900-mu-E m-2 s-1 PAR) maximal rates of NP around 20 nMol CO2 g-1 DW s-1 were attained.",NA,0367-2530,NA,WOS:A1991FF59200001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,selected,,,,,,

The physiological performance of these poikilohydric organisms depends on ambient climatic conditions interacting with light availability. However, bioclimatic models have tended to follow a common practice of selecting temperature/precipitation variables without reference to light as a key functional constraint. In this study a growth chamber simulation was used to reconstruct patterns of temperature-moisture-light for the baseline and 2080s climates, affecting the performance of the lichen Flavoparmelia caperata for a high-latitude (56 degrees N) temperate rainforest study site in Britain. The results demonstrate the importance of increased 2080s warmth and moisture under low winter light (possibly favoring respiration), and increased dormancy during drier and warmer summers (possibly reducing photosynthesis), resulting in negative growth (mass loss) for future climates. This is in direct contrast to the outcome of bioclimatic models applied to the same study site, which project increased environmental suitability based on a warmer and wetter climate (not considering irradiance). The study cautions that predictors for bioclimatic models should be chosen to reflect verified constraints in ecological performance (such as for growth), and especially for poikilohydric organisms this would include the interaction between ambient climate and light availability.",10.1639/0007-2745-122.1.098,0007-2745,1938-4378,WOS:000468440600008,NA,"Ellis, Christopher/0000-0003-1916-8746",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,selected,,,,,,

In winter there is extreme cold and darkness. During summer there is continuous light for some months and plant surface temperatures may fluctuate through more than 50 degrees C diurnally. Conditions are almost uniformly desiccative, except during spring when snow melt saturates thalli and plants may be completely inundated. The study of photosynthesis in these conditions is fundamental to a proper understanding of plant persistence, productivity and growth in polar regions. Lichens dominate the terrestrial vegetation of Antarctica and are therefore of great interest. Lichen photosynthesis has been shown to be dependent upon thallus water content and temperature as well as the irradiance incident on the thallus. Conventional infrared gas analysis (IRGA) techniques have been used most widely to study lichen photosynthesis in both the field and laboratory. Recent progress in the development of pulse amplitude modulated fluorescence systems has allowed the investigation of chlorophyll fluorescence in the field under naturally illuminated conditions. This paper highlights the utility of modulated fluorescence systems for the study of antarctic lichen photosynthesis, relates fluorescence results to those obtained by IRGA techniques, identifies problems inherent in fluorescence analysis of lichens and discusses possible areas of future research.",10.1071/PP9950321,0310-7841,NA,WOS:A1995QX86400019,"Hovenden, Mark J./A-1323-2008","Hovenden, Mark J./0000-0001-7208-9700","Robertson Symposium on Chlorophyll Fluorescence - Origins, Measurements, Interpretations and Applications, CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA, MAY 27-29, 1994",NA,"AUSTR NATL UNIV, RES SCH BIOL SCI; COOPERAT RES CTR PLANT SCI",NA,NA,NA,NA,selected,,,,,,

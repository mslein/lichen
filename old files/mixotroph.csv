X.WOS.000208863600356,article,"Ludwig, Marcus and Bryant, Donald A.","<i>Synechococcus</i> sp strain PCC 7002 transcriptome: acclimation to temperature, salinity, oxidative stress, and mixotrophic growth conditions",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2012,3,NA,NA,NA,"Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 is a unicellular, euryhaline cyanobacterium. It is a model organism for studies of cyanobacterial metabolism and has great potential for biotechnological applications. It exhibits an exceptional tolerance of high-light irradiation and shows very rapid growth. The habitats from which this and closely related strains were isolated are subject to changes in several environmental factors, including light, nutrient supply, temperature, and salinity. In this study global transcriptome profiling via RNAseq has been used to perform a comparative and integrated study of global changes in cells grown at different temperatures, at different salinities, and under mixotrophic conditions, when a metabolizable organic carbon source was present. Furthermore, the transcriptomes were investigated for cells that were subjected to a heat shock and that were exposed to oxidative stress. Lower growth temperatures caused relatively minor changes of the transcriptome; the most prominent changes affected fatty acid desaturases. A heat shock caused severe changes of the transcriptome pattern; transcripts for genes associated with major metabolic pathways declined and those for different chaperones increased dramatically. Oxidative stress, however, left the transcript pattern almost unaffected. When grown at high salinity, Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 had increased expression of genes involved in compatible solute biosynthesis and showed increased mRNA levels for several genes involved in electron transport. Transcripts of two adjacent genes dramatically increased upon growth at high salinity; the respective proteins are putatively involved in coping with oxidative stress and in triggering ion channels. Only minor changes were observed when cells were grown at low salinity or when the growth medium was supplemented with glycerol. However, the transcriptome data suggest that cells must acclimate to excess reducing equivalents when a reduced C-source is present.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",English,"Bryant, DA (Corresponding Author), Penn State Univ, Dept Biochem \& Mol Biol, 108 Althouse Lab, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.

One of the lakes (Tvillingvatnet) served as the water supply for the village of Ny Angstromlesund. The other was a deeper, larger unnamed lake in the Ossian Sarsfjella reserve-named Lake OS in this study. Both lakes can be classified as oligotrophic on the basis of chlorophyll a and inorganic nutrient concentrations. Chlorophyll a concentrations ranged between 0.33 and 1.65 mug l(-1) in Tvillingvatnet and 0.2 and 0.3 mug l(-1) in Lake OS. The phytoplankton was dominated by chrysophytes and cryptophytes, with the diatom Rhizosolenia and a number of dinoflagellate species. Rates of photosynthesis were typically low, between 24.5 mug and 1.0 mg l(-1) day(-1) in Tvillingvatnet (photosynthetic efficiency 0.004-0.26), and between 3.1 and 29.5 mug l(-1) day (-1) in Lake OS (photosynthetic efficiency 0.0019-0.0085). Among the phytoflagellates (PNAN) there were a number of mixotrophs which reached their peaks of abundance before other PNAN. Mixotrophy appeared to provide a competitive advantage. Grazing rates for the mixotroph Dinobryon ranged between 0.063 and 1.12 pg C cell(-1) day(-1) in Lake OS and between 0.22 and 1.11 pg cell(-1) day(-1) in Tvillingvatnet, with rates increasing between July and August. However, Dinobryon removed less than 1\% of bacterial biomass day(-1), while the heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNAN) removed up to 28\% of bacterial biomass day(-1). Bacterial concentrations were low, with a maximum of 28.8x10(8) l(-1) in Tvillingvatnet and 23.6x10(8) l(-1) in Lake OS.

However, no previous studies have investigated the metabolic responses of soft corals to DOC eutrophication, or its interaction with ocean warming. Thus, we investigated respiration and photosynthesis response of Xenia umbellata, a common mixotrophic soft coral from the Indo-pacific, to (1) three levels of DOC eutrophication simulated by glucose addition over the first 21 days of experiment and (2) ocean warming scenarios where the temperature was gradually increased from 26 degrees C (control condition) to 32 degrees C over another 24 days in an aquarium experiment. We found no significant difference in response to DOC treatments and all corals survived regardless of the DOC concentrations, whilst subsequent exposure to simulated ocean warming significantly decreased gross photosynthesis by approximately 50\% at 30 degrees C, and 65\% at 32 degrees C, net photosynthesis by 75\% at 30 degrees C and 79\% at 32 degrees C, and respiration by a maximum of 75\% at 30 degrees C; with a slight increase at 32 degrees C of 25\%. The ratio between gross photosynthesis and respiration decreased by the end of the warming period but remained similar between controls and colonies previously exposed to DOC. Our findings suggest that soft corals may be more resistant than hard corals to DOC eutrophication and in consequence, may potentially experiment in less magnitude the negative effects of increased temperature or subsequently both stressors. The results of this study may contribute to explain the successful role of soft corals in phase shifts as reported from many coral reefs.

Future changes in CO2 levels or terrestrial nutrient discharges in marine ecosystems can lead to increased phytoplankton C:N ratios relative to consumer C:N ratios, lowering the quality of the food source. In this study, we compared the single and interactive effects of diet quality and temperature on the feeding behavior and C and N intake and release of a common and abundant intertidal mixotrophic protist, the foraminifer Haynesina germanica. Two batches of artificially produced and dual isotope-labeled (C-13/N-15) chlorophyte detritus with different C:N ratios (5.6 and 7.1) were fed to the foraminifer at 3 different temperatures (15, 20, 25 degrees C). We observed a strong interactive effect of temperature and diet. A very strong increase in feeding rates was observed at 20 degrees C for the low-quality food source. Respiration rates of carbon derived from the low-quality diet (C:N ratio of 7.1) were lower than those of the high-quality diets and increased at 25 degrees C. This indicates that a high C content of the diet might be of advantage in calcifying mixotrophs, since respired excess C could be advantageous for test calcification. Additionally, respired excess C could be a useful resource of CO2 for kleptoplast photosynthesis and functionality in the mixotrophic lifestyle of H. germanica. Further, the observed effects of diet and temperature could impact nutrient fluxes in the habitat of H. germanica, possibly leading to food-web shifts in the future.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",English,"Wukovits, J (Corresponding Author), Univ Vienna, Dept Palaeontol, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.

As a result of this changing metabolic landscape, directional phenotypic evolution will occur, with implications that cascade up to the ecosystem level. While mixotrophic phytoplankton, organisms that combine photosynthesis and heterotrophy to meet their energetic and nutritional needs, are expected to become more heterotrophic with warmer temperatures due to heterotrophy increasing at a faster rate than photosynthesis, it is unclear how evolution will influence how these organisms respond to warmer temperatures. In this study, we used adaptive dynamics to model the consequences of temperature-mediated increases in metabolic rates for the evolution of mixotrophic phytoplankton, focusing specifically on phagotrophic mixotrophs. Results We find that mixotrophs tend to evolve to become more reliant on phagotrophy as temperatures rise, leading to reduced prey abundance through higher grazing rates. However, if prey abundance becomes too low, evolution favors greater reliance on photosynthesis. These responses depend upon the trade-off that mixotrophs experience between investing in photosynthesis and phagotrophy. Mixotrophs with a convex trade-off maintain mixotrophy over the greatest range of temperatures; evolution in these ``generalist{''} mixotrophs was found to exacerbate carbon cycle impacts, with evolving mixotrophs exhibiting increased sensitivity to rising temperature. Conclusions Our results show that mixotrophs may respond more strongly to climate change than predicted by phenotypic plasticity alone due to evolutionary shifts in metabolic investment. However, the type of metabolic trade-off experienced by mixotrophs as well as ecological feedback on prey abundance may ultimately limit the extent of evolutionary change along the heterotrophy-phototrophy spectrum.",BMC,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",English,"Gonzalez, LM (Corresponding Author), US Army Corps Engineers, Cold Reg Res \& Engn Lab, Biogeochem Sci Branch, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.

Metabolic theory predicts that mixotrophs will become more heterotrophic with rising temperatures, potentially creating a positive feedback loop that accelerates carbon dioxide accumulation in the atmosphere. Studies testing this theory have focused on phenotypically plastic (short-term, non-evolutionary) thermal responses of mixotrophs. However, as small organisms with short generation times and large population sizes, mixotrophs may rapidly evolve in response to climate change. Here, we present data from a 3-year experiment quantifying the evolutionary response of two mixotrophic nanoflagellates to temperature. We found evidence for adaptive evolution (increased growth rates in evolved relative to acclimated lineages) in the obligately phototrophic strain, but not in the facultative phototroph. All lineages showed trends of increased carbon use efficiency, flattening of thermal reaction norms, and a return to homeostatic gene expression.

Surprisingly, profiles of Chlamydomonas sp. grown. in the lab under photoautotrophic, mixotrophic, and heterotrophic conditions at in situ deep strata lake water temperatures (8degreesC) were very similar, polyunsaturated fatty acids including alpha-linolenic acid (18:3omega3) and 16:40 along with palmitic acid (16:0) being most abundant. Therefore, heterotrophic growth of Chlamydomonas sp. at low temperatures can result in high concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids, as previously only described for some psychrophilic bacteria. By contrast, the cultivation of isolated Chlamydomonas sp. at 20degreesC, reflecting surface water temperatures, provided fatty acid patterns characteristic of the nutrition strategy applied: the concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased when the growth pathway changed from photoautotrophic via mixotrophic to heterotrophic. Total fatty acid concentration also diminished in this order. Principal component analysis confirmed the significance of FA profiling to mirror nutritional pathways. Lake-water analysis revealed low concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, mainly consisting of polymeric fulvic acids that are unable to support heterotrophic growth of Chlamydomonas sp. Polymeric fulvic acids present in the deeper strata of the lake turned out to be formed in situ on the basis of organic monomers including reduced sulfur-containing ones, as revealed by thermochemolysis and pyrolysis. Growth of Chlamydomonas sp. in the deep chlorophyll maximum is therefore assumed to mainly result from photosynthesis, despite very low photon densities. Phytol-including metabolites proved to be significant biomarkers to indicate the nutritional pathway of Chlamydomonas sp. alpha, omega-Dicarboxylic acids-light-induced degradation products of unsaturated fatty acids-appeared to be good indicators of photooxidative alterations to the algal species under study.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",English,"Poerschmann, J (Corresponding Author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.

These ``mixotrophic{''}plankton, which play an important biogeochemical role in marine food webs, exhibit diverse metabolic strategies with varied contributions from photosynthesis and phagotrophy. Mixotrophs co-exist with specialist phototrophs and heterotrophs, competing for shared resources; yet we do not know how this competition alters a mixotroph's metabolic strategy or impacts biogeochemistry. We constructed a mathematical model to simulate the dynamics of a planktonic community which consists of mixotrophs and their specialist phototrophic competitor, phytoplankton. Our simulation demonstrates how the presence of competing phytoplankton causes metabolic character displacement, shifting mixotrophs to a more het-erotrophic niche. We find that the displacement is affected by various environmental and physiological factors. For example, this displacement effect is temperature dependent, suggesting a link between community-level competitive mechanisms and global climate change. The proposed model therefore may be used to develop a more comprehensive analysis of the competition between constitutive mixotrophs and specialist phototrophs or heterotrophs.

Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate Carboxylase-Oxygenase does not itself provide that constraint, but we identify other factors that result in our previously suggested value of similar to 2 doublings per day still likely being representative of the maximum for most photoautotrophs. mu(max) likely evolves to balance the advantage of possessing a high competitive value while minimizing the stresses incurred when the organism is incapable of routinely achieving a higher mu(max) due to various limiting factors. Organisms with extreme high mu(max) are thus expected to grow under conditions that provide the necessary environment (stable pH, non-limiting nutrients and light) for sufficient time that the evolution of higher mu(max) becomes advantageous. Conditions in nature allowing the evolution of higher mu(max) include the exploitation of an exceptional opportunity and then entering stasis (e.g. desert microalgae), or a situation where high grazing pressures match high phytoplankton growth, thus maintaining non-limiting nutrient and light conditions. The latter, however, conflicts with the paradox of enrichment, as only under resource limitation would the necessary stability be attained in the predator-prey dynamic.

Mixotrophic strategies can be highly advantageous when feeding or photosynthesis alone does not sustain metabolic needs. In the current review, we discuss the functional types of mixotrophic marine protists (herein mixoplankton) within the context of evolution. Permanent plastids have been established in large due to gene transfer from prey and/or endosymbionts to the host cell. In some kleptoplastidic mixoplankton, prior gene transfers and active transcription of plastid related genes in the host can help maintain and extend retention of the current kleptoplast. In addition to kleptoplasts, the prey nucleus is also sometimes retained and actively transcribed to help maintain and even replicate the kleptoplasts. Endosymbiotic relations vary considerably in the extent to which hosts affect symbionts. For example, some endosymbionts are heavily modified to increase photosynthetic efficiency, or are controlled in their cell division. It can be proposed that many kleptoplasts and endosymbionts are in fact en route to becoming permanent plastids. Conditions such as increased temperature and limiting nutrients seem to favor phagotrophy in mixoplankton. However, responses of mixoplankton to changing environmental conditions like light irradiance, temperature, nutrient, and prey availability are variable and species-specific. Studying mixotrophs with temporary plastids could elucidate past and future evolutionary mechanisms and dynamics of processes such as phagotrophy and the establishment of (secondary) permanent plastids.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",English,"Anestis, K (Corresponding Author), Alfred Wegener Inst Helmholtz Ctr Polar \& Marine, Dept Ecol Chem, Bremerhaven, Germany.

Counterintuitively, the species with low or moderate growth rates but diverse prey including diatoms caused red tides globally. The ability of these dinoflagellates to trade off growth for prey diversity is another genetic factor critical to formation of red tides across diverse ocean conditions.

However, the trophic strategy of unicellular organisms can take a range of mixotrophic strategies with both autotrophic and heterotrophic contributions. The dominant emerging strategy found in nature depends on the environment (both biotic and abiotic aspects) and the cell size and influences key ecosystem functions like trophic transfer and carbon export. Ecosystem models that faithfully represent this diversity of trophic strategies are lacking. Here we develop a trait-based model of unicellular plankton with cell size as the master trait and three other traits that determine trophic strategies: investments in photosynthesis, nutrient uptake, and phagotrophy. This unicellular model spans the entire auto- mixo- hererotrophic strategy continuum and the entire size range of unicellular organisms. The model reproduces observed latitudinal patterns in biomass, primary productivity, vertical carbon export, and energy transfer efficiency; all increase with increasing latitude. The size range of mixotrophic cells is independent of the season at low latitudes. At high latitudes, the dominance of pure phototrophs during early spring restricts mixotrophic behavior to a narrower range of cell sizes and with the occurrence of relatively smaller mixotrophs during summer.

Here, we summarize the current knowledge on the diversity of zooxanthellate jellyfishes, to identify key traits of the holobionts, and to examine the impact of these traits on their ecology. Photosymbiosis with zooxanthellae originated at least seven times independently in Medusozoa; of these, five involve taxa with medusae. While most zooxanthellate jellyfishes are found in clades containing mainly non-zooxanthellate members, the sub-order Kolpophorae (Scyphozoa: Rhizostomeae) is comprised-bar a few intriguing exceptions-of only zooxanthellate jellyfishes. We estimate that 20-25\% of Scyphozoa species are zooxanthellate (facultative symbiotic species included). Zooxanthellae play a key role in scyphozoan life-cycle and nutrition although substantial variation is observed during ontogeny, or at the intra- and inter-specific levels. Nonetheless, three key traits of zooxanthellate jellyfishes can be identified: (1) zooxanthellate medusae, as holobionts, are generally mixotrophic, deriving their nutrition both from predation and photosynthesis; (2) zooxanthellate polyps, although capable of hosting zooxanthellae rarely depend on them; and (3) zooxanthellae play a key role in the life-cycle of the jellyfish by allowing or facilitating strobilation. We discuss how these traits might help to explain some aspects of the ecology of zooxanthellate jellyfishes-notably their generally low ability to outbreak, and their reaction to temperature stress or to eutrophication-and how they could in turn impact marine ecosystem functioning.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",English,"Djeghri, N (Corresponding Author), Univ Brest, Inst Univ Europeen Mer, IUEM UBO, Lab Sci Environm Marin,LEMAR,UMR 6539, Technopole Brest Iroise,Rue Dumont dUrville, F-29280 Plouzane, France.

Characterizing these attributes has been approached by 1) building reference models for specific Phanerozoic intervals, 2) recognizing the climatic impact in modulating carbonate production, and 3) analyzing the influence of changing bio-geochemical conditions. The reference-model approach is mostly based on biological evolution, the climatic-impact approach emphasizes temperature, and the bio-geochemical approach considers the changes in Mg/Ca ratios and Ca++ concentrations in the oceans. To date, however, an analysis integrating all of these factors is still missing. The analysis presented here includes all these factors but also CO2, which is fundamental for both photosynthesis and CaCO3 precipitation. Here we analyze the waxing and waning of Cenozoic reef limestones from the central Tethys region through several steps: 1) on the basis of rock volume, rock textures, associated sediments and light dependent skeletal components, as records of light penetration and wave energy (depth); 2) on global environmental conditions (delta C-13, delta O-18, pCO(2), temperature); and 3) on the basis of functionality, nutritional requirements and available resources. Through the Cenozoic, water motion, whether induced by surface or internal waves or by currents, increased as the thermal gradients strengthened, both with depth and with latitude. Active water motion is essential for plankton catchers such as corals, but less so for many larger benthic foraminifers (LBF). Pycnoclines in the meso-oligophotic zone would then favor the benthic plankton catchers such as corals, but would be detrimental for many LBF. Warm temperatures favored LBF. The Eocene LBF families predominated during lowering of atmospheric pCO(2) by using respiratory CO2 to enhance the symbiont production of photosynthates under oligotrophic conditions and limited turbulence, whereas the Miocene families had to adapt to a progressive increase in turbulence. The eurythermal coralline red algae, however, became preponderant producers in the mesophotic zone during times when the delta C-13 was relatively high. This explains two apparent paradoxes: 1) corals thrive best when the Earth's high latitudes cool, and 2) the dominance of corals and LBF is inversely correlated, despite they both require tropical conditions and have similar trophic strategies (mixotrophy).

The macro and the meso scale equations capture the temporal dynamics of the transport of CO2, O-2, H+, organic carbon and nitrogen sources in the photobioreactor and the cell, respectively, while the micro scale quantifies the reaction rates of CO2 fixation and photorespiration in the chloroplast, and mitochondrial respiration. Our model is validated using our experiments (R-2 = 0.96-0.99) on urea, CO2 (0.04-5\%), and acetic acid-mediated mixotrophic cultivation of Chlorella sorokiniana for 138 h using municipal wastewater (with and without media) at 11,000 lx light in 25-liter pilot-scale bubble-column photobioreactors, which produces 0.47-2.74 g/L biomass with 22.8-29.6\% lipids, while reducing the COD, ammonium, phosphate, nickel, and H+ concentrations by 65-89\%. The alga assimilates the ammonium and the phosphates present in wastewater into amino acids and ATP, respectively. Our simulations quantify the autotrophic and heterotrophic components of mixotrophic biomass yield to find the optimal inlet CO2 concentration (of 3\%) that synergizes autotrophic CO2 sequestration with heterotrophic assimilation of organic carbon, thereby maximizing both autotrophic and heterotrophic growths. Super-optimal levels of inlet CO2 acidify the stroma of the chloroplast, inhibit RuBisCo's enzymatic activity for CO2 fixation in the Calvin Cycle, decelerate carrier-mediated uptake of acetate, and reduce biomass yields. Our harvesting process drastically reduces the algal harvesting time to less than 29 min. This multiscale reaction-transport model provides a useful tool for further scaling up this pilot-scale technology that synergistically integrates CO2 sequestration and wastewater treatment with rapid microalgal cultivation (using municipal wastewater without autoclaving) and cost-effective harvesting.",ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",English,"Chakraborty, S (Corresponding Author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Kharagpur 721302, India.

Here, we explored, from macro-to nano-scale, the skeletal structural and compositional characteristics of three coral species belonging to the genus Balanophyllia having different trophic strategies. The goal is to address whether the onset of mixotrophy influenced the skeletal features of B. elegans, B. regia, and B. europaea. The macroscale data suggest that the presence of symbiotic algae in B. europaea can lead to a surplus of energy input that increases its growth rate and skeletal bulk density, leading to larger and denser corals compared to the azooxanthellate ones, B. regia and B. elegans. The symbiosis would also explain the higher intra-skeletal organic matrix (OM) content, which is constituted by macromolecules promoting the calcification, in B. europaea compared to the azooxanthellate species. The characterization of the soluble OM also revealed differences between B. europaea and the azooxanthellate species, which may be linked to diverse macromolecular machineries responsible for skeletal biosynthesis and final morphology. Differently, the crystallographic features were homogenous among species, suggesting that the basic building blocks of skeletons remained a conserved trait in these related species, regardless of the trophic strategy. These results show changes in skeletal phenotype that could be triggered by the onset of mixotrophy, as a consequence of the symbiotic association, displaying remarkable plasticity of coral skeletons which repeatedly allowed this coral group to adapt to a range of changing environments throughout its geological history.

During this time, they are unable to photosynthesize, and so must consume stored energy products. However, some organisms such as polar algae and some microalgal cysts and spores are exposed to darkness for months to years, and these must use alternative strategies to survive. Some taxa, such as dinoflagellates, form cysts and become dormant. Others use physiological methods or adopt mixotrophy. The longest documented survival of more than a century was for dinoflagellates buried in sediments in a Norwegian fjord. Seasonal changes in daylight hours are naturally unaffected by climate change. This means that polar microalgae will in the future need to survive the same period of seasonal darkness but at higher temperatures, and this will require a greater drawdown of stored energy.

Rates of ingestion and photosynthesis increased with temperature to a maximum at 16 degrees C under the two higher light regimes, and declined at 20 degrees C. Although both light and temperature had a marked effect on photosynthesis, there was no significant difference in bacterivory at medium and high irradiances at any given temperature. At the lowest light condition (25 mu mol photons . m(-2) . s(-1)), photosynthesis remained low and relatively stable at all temperatures. D. sociale acquired the majority of carbon from photosynthesis, although the low photosynthetic rate without a concurrent decline in feeding rate at 8 degrees C suggested 20\%-30\% of the carbon budget could be attributed to bacterivory at low temperatures. Grazing experiments in nutrient-modified media revealed that this mixotroph had increased ingestion rates when either dissolved nitrogen or phosphorus was decreased.

Our results show that (1) grazing rates on bacterial prey increased more strongly with temperature than photosynthetic electron transport rates, (2) heterotrophic growth rates increased exponentially with temperature over the entire range from 13 to 33 degrees C, while autotrophic growth rates reached a maximum at intermediate temperatures and (3) chlorophyll contents during mixotrophic growth decreased at high temperature.

However, how mixotrophs, especially obligate CM, balance phototrophy and phagotrophy in response to changing environmental conditions remains equivocal. Here, we examined the growth performance, photosynthesis traits, and phagotrophic activities of a mixotrophic green alga, Picochlorum sp. GLMF1, over a wide range of temperature-irradiance combinations. The growth of Picochlorum sp. exhibited a unimodal thermal response under all the experimental light intensities. The optimal growth temperature decreased dramatically when the irradiance exceeded 80 mu mol m-2 s-1, whereas the maximum growth rate kept a relatively constant and high value (around 1.1 d-1). This might be attributed to the trade-off between photosynthesis and ingestion under various light and temperature conditions. We found that the photosynthetic electron transport rate (ETR) and chlorophyll a specific inorganic carbon uptake rate increased with increasing irradiance. The maximum ETR decreased from 22.26 +/- 1.93 mu mol e m-2 s-1 at 22 degrees C to 8.96 +/- 0.42 mu mol e m-2 s-1 at 31 degrees C, suggesting a significant constraint of photosynthesis at high temperature. By contrast, ingestion increased with increasing temperature in most cases, and was significantly lower under high irradiance conditions. Combining the contributions of phototrophic and phagotrophic processes to total carbon acquisition, Picochlorum sp. showed a flexible nutritional strategy in response to temperature and light. Increasing light favors photosynthesis, whereas warming stimulates phagotrophy. Such complementation allows them to flourish under a wide range of temperature and irradiance.

Using the flagellate Euglena gracilis, we first tested if photosynthesis-respiration coupling occurs in this species harbouring secondary green plastids (i.e. originated from an endosymbiosis between a green alga and a phagotrophic euglenozoan). Second, we tested how the trophic state (mixotrophy and photoautotrophy) of the cell alters the mechanisms involved in the photosynthesis-respiration coupling. Energetic coupling between photosynthesis and respiration was determined by testing the effect of respiratory inhibitors on photosynthesis, and measuring the simultaneous variation of photosynthesis and respiration rates as a function of temperature (i.e. thermal response curves). The mechanism involved in the photosynthesis-respiration coupling was assessed by combining proteomics, biophysical and cytological analyses. Our work shows that there is photosynthesis-respiration coupling and membrane contacts between mitochondria and chloroplasts in E. gracilis. However, whereas in mixotrophy adjustment of the chloroplast ATP/NADPH ratio drives the interaction, in photoautotrophy the coupling is conditioned by CO2 limitation and photorespiration. This indicates that maintenance of photosynthesis-respiration coupling, through plastic metabolic responses, is key to E. gracilis functioning under changing environmental conditions.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Cardol, P (Corresponding Author), ULiege, InBioS PhytoSYST, Lab Genet \& Phys Microalgues, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.

Growth experiments in batch cultures, exudation measurements, and competition experiments in chemostats were performed at two temperature levels. Increased temperature stimulated the autotrophic growth rate of Chlorella protothecoides. Bacteria and Chlorella increased their heterotrophic growth rates at higher DOM concentration at lower temperature whereas enhanced DOM concentration hardly stimulated their growth at higher temperature. In chemostats, enhanced input of soil extract increased both bacterial and algal biomass at lower temperature whereas bacterial biomass increased only slightly and algal biomass decreased at higher temperature.

Understanding the physiological responses of mixoplankton and protozooplankton, key members of marine food webs, to temperature is crucial. Here, we studied two dinoflagellates (one protozoo- and one mixoplanktonic), two ciliates (one protozoo- and one mixoplanktonic), and two cryptophytes. We report the acute (24 h) responses on growth and grazing to a range of temperatures (5-34 degrees C). We also determined respiration and photosynthetic rates for the four grazers within 6 degrees C of warming. The thermal performance curves showed that, in general, ciliates have higher optimal temperatures than dinoflagellates and that protozooplankton is better adapted to warming than mixoplankton. Our results confirmed that warmer temperatures decrease the cellular volumes of all species. Q(10) coefficients suggest that grazing is the rate that increases the most in response to temperature in protozooplankton. Yet, in mixoplankton, grazing decreased in warmer temperatures, whereas photosynthesis increased. Therefore, we suggest that the Metabolic Theory of Ecology should reassess mixoplankton's position for the correct parameterisation of future climate change models. Future studies should also address the multigenerational response to temperature changes, to confirm whether mixoplankton become more phototrophic than phagotrophic in a warming scenario after adaptation.",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",English,"Calbet, A (Corresponding Author), CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Pg Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, Barcelona 08003, Spain.

Shifts in temperature (T) and light (i.e. the ultraviolet portion of spectrum (UVR)) are key abiotic factors that modulate the conditions under which an organism is able to live. However, whether the interaction between both drivers alters mixotrophy in a global-change context remains unassessed. To determine the T x UVR effects on relative electron transport rates, nonphotochemical quenching, bacterivory, and bacterial production, we conducted an experiment with Isochrysis galbana populations grown mixotrophically, which were exposed to 5 degrees C of cooling and warming with respect to the control (19 degrees C) with (or without) UVR over light-dark cycles and different timescales. At the beginning of the experiment, cooling inhibited the relative electron transport and bacterivory rates, whereas warming depressed only bacterivory regardless of the radiation treatment. By the end of the experiment, warming and UVR conditions stimulated bacterivory. These reduced relative electron transport rates (c. 50\% (warming) and > 70\% (cooling)) were offset by increased (35\%) cumulative bacterivory rates under warming and UVR conditions. We propose that mixotrophy constitutes an energy-saving and a compensatory mechanism to gain carbon (C) when photosynthesis is impaired, and highlight the need to consider the natural environmental changes affecting the populations when we test the impacts of interacting global-change drivers.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Cabrerizo, MJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol, Campus Fuentenueva S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain.

The ``top-down{''} control of cyanobacteria from consumers like the protozoans shows great potential because of the effectiveness and environment-friendliness. To reveal how the nutrition availability and elevated temperature affect the cyanobacteria removal through protozoans grazing, we grew the toxic Microcystis aeruginosa and the mixotrophic Ochromonas gloeopara in monocultures and cocultures at environmentally relevant ni-trogen levels (0.5-8.0 mg L-1) under 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C, respectively. The growth of M. aeruginosa in monocultures was significantly enhanced as nitrogen concentration and temperature rose, partially benefitting from the promoted pho-tosynthesis. By contrast, nitrogen availability affected neither the photoautotrophic growth nor the feeding on Microcystis of the mixotrophic O. gloeopara, but high temperature induced the mixotroph to be more heterotrophic as evidenced by the suppressed photosynthesis but strengthened feeding activity. Accordingly, the M. aeruginosa re-moval through O. gloeopara grazing in cocultures was delayed with increasing nitrogen, which, however, was sharply accelerated by elevated temperature. Based on the Gaussian models fitting, the theoretical time that the Microcystis was removed at 25 degrees C was prolonged from about 7.5 days to 10 days with increased nitrogen, but it was reduced to less than 4.6 days in all groups at 30 degrees C.

Methods: 4.5-ml cuvettes containing 2 ml of culture, a high-throughput system equivalent to batch cultures, were used with gas exchange ensured by the use of a Parafilm (TM) cover. The effect of the different variables on maximum growth was assessed by a multi-way statistical analysis. Results: Temperature and pH were identified as the key factors. It was observed that Synechocystis cells have a strong influence on the external pH. The optimal growth temperature was 33 degrees C while light-saturating conditions were reached at 40 mu E.m(-2.)s(-1). Conclusion: It was demonstrated that Synechocystis exhibits a marked difference in behavior between autotrophic and glucose-based mixotrophic conditions, and that nitrate concentrations did not have a significant influence, probably due to endogenous nitrogen reserves. Furthermore, a dynamic metabolic model of Synechocystis photosynthesis was developed to gain insights on the underlying mechanism enabling this cyanobacterium to control the levels of external pH.

Respiration increased from 0 to 30 degrees C in all groups of phytoplankton, while gross photosynthesis stabilised at 10 to 15 degrees C. Light saturation occurred at 25 to 75 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1), indicating low light adaptation of the algae. Picoplankton showed the strongest temperature response, and at temperatures above 10 degrees C picoplankton obtained a higher biomass specific photosynthesis than that of the other groups. Different light treatments had no effect on the species composition in experiments with natural algal assemblages, while different temperature conditions had a marked effect. With a temperature increase from 0 to 10 degrees C, the algal community changed from a typical spring community, with diatoms and dinoflagellates, to a summer community, dominated by mixotrophic nanoflagellates. The small, or often non-existing, autumn bloom in the sea area studied, can be explained by short day lengths combined with relatively high temperatures, causing high community respiration rates and low gross photosynthesis, resulting in a negative energy balance. The net energy gain depends on a differential temperature effect on gross photosynthesis and endogenous respiration in various plankton groups. This gives the phytoplankton groups diverse competitive advantages during different seasons and thus may be an important factor in controlling algal succession.",SPRINGER VERLAG,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",English,"ANDERSSON, A (Corresponding Author), UMEA UNIV,DEPT MICROBIOL,S-90187 UMEA,SWEDEN.",10.1007/BF00350071,0025-3162,NA,NA,SPRING BLOOM; FOOD WEBS; PHYTOPLANKTON; BACTERIOPLANKTON; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; BIOMASS; CARBON; WATERS; PHOTORESPIRATION; RESPIRATION,Marine \& Freshwater Biology,Marine \& Freshwater Biology,NA,NA,NA,NA,34,107,0,60,Mar.

The in vitro plantlets were established in airtight vessels (C) and ventilative vessels with a gas permeable film (V) and grown for 15 days under 16 h photoperiod with fluorescent lamps (130 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)) and 25 degrees C air temperature. High CO2 concentration surrounding vessels (about 1200 mu l.l(-1), Vco(2)) was applied through experiments. No difference was measured in shoot and root dry weight, total leaf area, and CO2 and light saturated rate of photosynthesis between plantlets in treatments V and Vco(2) grown in the ventilative vessels. Total dry weight, total leaf area, and maximum photosynthesis of the in vitro plantlets grown in V increased up to about 4, 2, and 2 times, respectively, greater than those grown in C. Also there were significant increases in both chlorophyll and total soluble protein contents in leaves of the plantlets in treatment V compared with the plantlets in treatment C with positive correlations between maximum photosynthesis and both chlorophyll and total soluble protein contents. Promoting growth of the in vitro plantlets under ventilative conditions may be result of the enhanced photosynthetic late in photoautotrophy because of the relieved CO2 starvation for the in vitro plantlets during photoperiod.

To predict how temperature changes affect plankton community dynamics and function, we developed a mechanistic trait-based model of unicellular plankton (auto-hetero-mixotrophic protists and bacteria). Temperature dependencies are specifically implemented on cellular process rather than at the species level. As the uptake of resources and metabolic processes have different temperature dependencies, changes in the thermal environment will favor organisms with different investments in processes such as photosynthesis and biosynthesis. The precise level of investments, however, is conditional on the limiting process and is ultimately determined dynamically by competition and predation within the emergent community of the water column. We show how an increase in temperature can intensify nutrient limitation by altering organisms' interactions, and reduce relative cell-size in the community. Further, we anticipate that a combination of temperature and resource limitation reduces ecosystem efficiency at capturing carbon due to strengthening of the microbial loop. By explicitly representing the effects of temperature on traits responsible for growth, we demonstrate how changes on the individual level can be scaled up to trends at the ecosystem level, helping to discern direct from indirect effects of temperature on natural plankton communities.",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Serra-Pompei, C (Corresponding Author), Tech Univ Denmark, Ctr Ocean Life, Natl Inst Aquat Resources DTU Aqua, Lyngby, Denmark.

However, they are affected by environmental conditions, such as temperature, which in turn affect their distribution. Globally, the cyanobacterium Fischerella thermalis is one of the main primary producers in terrestrial hot springs with thermal gradients up to 60 degrees C, but the mechanisms by which F. thermalis maintains its photosynthetic activity at these high temperatures are not known. In this study, we used molecular approaches and bioinformatics, in addition to photophysiological analyses, to determine the genetic activity associated with the energy metabolism of F. thermalis both in situ and in high-temperature (40 degrees C to 65 degrees C) cultures. Our results show that photosynthesis of F. thermalis decays with temperature, while increased transcriptional activity of genes encoding photosystem II reaction center proteins, such as PsbA (D1), could help overcome thermal damage at up to 60 degrees C. We observed that F. thermalis tends to lose copies of the standard G4 D1 isoform while maintaining the recently described D1(INT) isoform, suggesting a preference for photoresistant isoforms in response to the thermal gradient. The transcriptional activity and metabolic characteristics of F. thermalis, as measured by metatranscriptomics, further suggest that carbon metabolism occurs in parallel with photosynthesis, thereby assisting in energy acquisition under high temperatures at which other photosynthetic organisms cannot survive. This study reveals that, to cope with the harsh conditions of hot springs, F. thermalis has several compensatory adaptations, and provides emerging evidence for mixotrophic metabolism as being potentially relevant to the thermotolerance of this species. Ultimately, this work increases our knowledge about thermal adaptation strategies of cyanobacteria.",MDPI,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",English,"Dez, B (Corresponding Author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Biol Sci Fac, Dept Mol Genet \& Microbiol, Santiago 8331150, Chile.

Under such conditions, these photosynthetic microorganisms may be close to their physiological compensation points and to the boundaries of their ecological tolerance. To grow and survive any resulting energy limitation, DCM species are thought to exhibit highly specialised or flexible acclimation strategies. In this study, we investigated several of the adaptable ecophysiological strategies potentially employed by one such species, Chlamydomonas acidophila: a motile, unicellular, phytoplanktonic flagellate that often dominates the DCM in stratified, acidic lakes. Physiological and behavioural responses were measured in laboratory experiments and were subsequently related to field observations. Results showed moderate light compensation points for photosynthesis and growth at 22A degrees C, relatively low maintenance costs, a behavioural preference for low to moderate light, and a decreased compensation point for photosynthesis at 8A degrees C. Even though this flagellated alga exhibited a physiologically mediated diel vertical migration in the field, migrating upwards slightly during the day, the ambient light reaching the DCM was below compensation points, and so calculations of daily net photosynthetic gain showed that survival by purely autotrophic means was not possible. Results suggested that strategies such as low-light acclimation, small-scale directed movements towards light, a capacity for mixotrophic growth, acclimation to low temperature, in situ exposure to low O-2, high CO2 and high P concentrations, and an avoidance of predation, could combine to help overcome this energetic dilemma and explain the occurrence of the DCM. Therefore, corroborating the deceptive ecophysiological complexity of this and similar organisms, only a suite of complementary strategies can facilitate the survival of C. acidophila in this DCM.",SPRINGER,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",English,"Clegg, MR (Corresponding Author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem \& Biol, Neuen Palais 10, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany.

Greater phagotrophic activity could reinforce the bypass of carbon (C) flux through the bacteria-mixotroph link and thus lead to a more efficient transfer of C and other nutrients to the top of the trophic web. Determining how foreseeable changes in temperature and UVR affect mixotrophic trade-offs in favor of one or the other nutritional strategy, along the mixotrophic gradient, is key to understanding the fate of carbon and mineral nutrients in the aquatic ecosystem. Our two main hypotheses were: (i) that increased warming and UVR will divert metabolism toward phagotrophy, and (ii) that the magnitude of this shift will vary according to the organism's position along the mixotrophic gradient. To test these hypotheses, we used two protists (Isochrysis galbana and Chromulina sp.) located in different positions on the mixotrophic gradient, subjecting them to the action of temperature and of UVR and their interaction. Our results showed that the joint action of these two factors increased the primary production:bacterivory ratio and stoichiometric values (N:P ratio) close to Redfield's ratio. Therefore, temperature and UVR shifted the metabolism of both organisms toward greater phototrophy regardless of the original position of the organism on the mixotrophic gradient.

In this study, Paramecium bursaria containing endosymbiotic Chlorella was tested for the effect of light on its ingestion rate. P. bursaria was grown for 4 to 6 days under five different light fluxes ranging from 1 to 90 microeinsteins s-1 m-2. Ingestion rates were determined by using 0.77-mu-m-diameter fluorescent microspheres. 4',6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride-labeled Enterobacter cloacae was used in one experiment to confirm differences in uptake rates of bacteria by P. bursaria. Unlike phagotrophic phytoflagellates, the ciliates demonstrated different ingestion rates in response to different light intensities. Although symbionts contribute carbon to their host via photosynthesis, the paramecia of the present study fed faster after exposure to higher light intensities, whereas their aposymbiotic counterparts (lacking endosymbionts) were unaffected. Light-induced changes in ingestion rates were not immediate, but corresponded to the period of time required for endosymbiont populations to change significantly. This strongly suggests that the symbionts, stimulated by higher light levels, may dictate the feeding rates of their hosts.

Their growth, demise, and interactions with other microorganisms drive the fluxes of biogeochemical elements through marine ecosystems. Mixotrophic protists are capable of both photosynthesis and ingestion of prey and are dominant components of open-ocean planktonic communities. Yet the role of mixotrophs in elemental cycling is obscured by their capacity to act as primary producers or heterotrophic consumers depending on factors that remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we develop and apply a machine learning model that predicts the in situ trophic mode of aquatic protists based on their patterns of gene expression. This approach leverages a public collection of protist transcriptomes as a training set to identify a subset of gene families whose transcriptional profiles predict trophic mode. We applied our model to nearly 100 metatranscriptomes obtained during two oceanographic cruises in the North Pacific and found community-level and population-specific evidence that abundant open-ocean mixotrophic populations shift their predominant mode of nutrient and carbon acquisition in response to natural gradients in nutrient supply and sea surface temperature. Metatranscriptomic data from ship-board incubation experiments revealed that abundant mixotrophic prymnesiophytes from the oligotrophic North Pacific subtropical gyre rapidly remodeled their transcriptome to enhance photosynthesis when supplied with limiting nutrients. Coupling this approach with experiments designed to reveal the mechanisms driving mixotroph physiology provides an avenue toward understanding the ecology of mixotrophy in the natural environment.",NATL ACAD SCIENCES,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",English,"Lambert, BS (Corresponding Author), Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.

To further increase the biomass and the biotechnological potential of this strain in these conditions, mixotrophic growth (i.e., the simultaneous use of photosynthesis and respiration) with glycerol as an external carbon source was investigated in this study and compared with phototrophic growth that made use of air enriched with 1-2\% CO2. The addition of either glycerol or CO2-enriched air stimulated the growth of Ng and theproduction of high-value long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (EPA) as well as the carotenoid canthaxanthin. Bioassays in human prostate cell lines indicated the highest antitumoral activity for Ng extracts and fractions from mixotrophic conditions. Metabolomics detected betaine lipids specifically in the bioactive fractions, suggesting their involvement in the observed antitumoral effect. Genes related to autophagy were found to be upregulated by the most bioactive fraction, suggesting a possible therapeutic target against prostate cancer progression.

To explore the coral response to LAIW, prey capture disposition and photosynthesis were investigated in relation to changes in seawater temperature, pH, flow speed and food availability in LAIW simulation studies under controlled laboratory conditions, using Porites lutea as a model organism. Although food presence stimulated polyp expansion, we found an overriding effect of low temperature (19 degrees C) causing retraction of the coral polyps into their calices, particularly when pH was altered concomitantly. Decreases in pH alone, however, caused the expansion of the polyps. The exposure history of the colonies played a crucial role in coral responses: prior field exposure to LAIW yielded lower retraction levels than in LAIW-inexperienced corals, suggesting acclimatization. Low temperature (19 degrees C) exposure did not seem to influence the photosynthetic performance, but LAIW-experienced corals showed higher values of maximum dark-adapted quantum yield (F-v/F-m) of photosystem II than LAIW-inexperienced controls.

Much attention has been given to the importance of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates as primary grazers of bacteria. However, the prevalence of phagotrophy by phytoplankton across many environments emphasizes a need to include mixotrophy in studies of the protistan food web. Few studies have addressed the seasonal dynamics nor grazing activity of mixotrophs in freshwater environments, especially those that extend below surface waters. The goal of this work was to examine temporal patterns in mixotroph abundance and taxon-specific bacterivory, with a focus on Dinobryon. Results shown here support our general predictions of increased bacterivory by Dinobryon where a low light and nutrient environment may promote grazing. Dinobryon spp. were numerically dominant members of the community under-ice in winter, possibly as a result of their ability to supplement photosynthesis with phagotrophy of bacteria in conditions of reduced irradiance and day length. However, daily grazing rate and associated impact on the bacterial community during winter were not substantial. These results highlight the importance of including winter sampling when an active community of phagotrophic phytoflagellates may play a major role in ecosystem functioning.

This was first observed in July 2001 at the station BY 15 in the Gotland Deep, where a sharp and intensive chlorophyll fluorescence signal was encountered at 77 m depth. The fluorescence peak was due to a dinoflagellate community dominated by Dinophysis acuminata (approximately 18 000 cells 1(-1)). The survival of this community was followed in laboratory incubations in low light (20 muE m(-2) s(-1)) and low temperature (+5 degreesC). After 5 weeks incubation, 67-84\% of the initial cell abundance was lost, while few D. acuminata cells survived up to 24 weeks in the original sample. During the incubation, the fluorescence signal of the cells became fainter and the chloroplasts smaller and aggregated. On two occasions a D. acuminata cell was found attached to a smaller cell by a thin cytoplasm strand, possibly indicating mixotrophic behavior. During the following summer (2002), the photosynthetic efficiency of D. acuminata collected from thermocline layers of few stations and from the nitracline (75-80 m) at one station was studied in photosynthesis irradiance (P-E) incubations. Photosynthetic activity occurred in all populations, with differences in their photosynthetic carbon uptake rates. Photosynthesis of D. acuminata populations was saturated between 250 and 500 muE m(-2) s(-1); maximum cell-specific carbon uptake rates (P,,) ranged from 160-925 pg C cell(-1) h(-1). The P-m-rates in populations originating below the thermocline and in an artificially darkened population were markedly lower than in populations from upper water layers.

Such extreme environments support truncated food webs with no fish, few metazoans and a dominance of microbial plankton. The key to success lies in entering the short Antarctic summer with actively growing populations. In many cases, the most successful organisms continue to function throughout the year. The few crustacean zooplankton remain active in the winter months, surviving on endogenous energy reserves and, in some cases, continuing development. Among the Protozoa, mixotrophy is an important nutritional strategy. In the extreme lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, planktonic cryptophytes are forced to sustain a mixotrophic strategy and cannot survive by photosynthesis alone. The dependence on ingesting bacteria varies seasonally and with depth in the water column. In the Vestfold Hills, Pyramimonas, which dominates the plankton of some of the saline lakes, also resorts to mixotrophy, but does become entirely photosynthetic at mid-summer. Mixotrophic ciliates are also common and the entirely photosynthetic ciliate Mesodinium rubrum has a widespread distribution in the saline lakes of the Vestfold Hills, where it attains high concentrations. Bacteria continue to grow all year, showing cycles that appear to be related to the availability of dissolved organic carbon. In saline lakes, bacteria experience sub-zero temperatures for long periods of the year and have developed biochemical adaptations that include anti-freeze proteins, changes in the concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids in their membranes and suites of low-temperature enzymes.",ROYAL SOC,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",English,"Laybourn-Parry, J (Corresponding Author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Life \& Environm Sci, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.

However, equivalent oscillations in metabolism are not reported under LL in this non-nitrogen fixing cyanobacterium. Here we focus on Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142, a unicellular, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium known to temporally separate the processes of oxygenic photosynthesis and oxygen-sensitive nitrogen fixation. In a recent report, metabolism of Cyanothece 51142 has been shown to oscillate between photosynthetic and respiratory phases under LL with free running periods that are temperature dependent but significantly shorter than the circadian period. Further, the oscillations shift to circadian pattern at moderate cell densities that are concomitant with slower growth rates. Here we take this understanding forward and demonstrate that the ultradian rhythm under LL sustains at much higher cell densities when grown under turbulent regimes that simulate flashing light effect. Our results suggest that the ultradian rhythm in metabolism may be needed to support higher carbon and nitrogen requirements of rapidly growing cells under LL. With a comprehensive Real time PCR based gene expression analysis we account for key regulatory interactions and demonstrate the interplay between clock genes and the genes of key metabolic pathways. Further, we observe that several genes that peak at dusk in Synechococcus peak at dawn in Cyanothece and vice versa.

Planktonic ciliates were examined during a spring-summer period (November 1998-April 1999) in the ultraoligotrophic Lake Moreno Oeste (41degrees5'S and 71degrees33'W, 758 m a.s.l), which belongs to the Nahuel Huapi System (Patagonia, Argentina). The lake is deep (Z(max) = 90 m) and warm monomictic. 2. Sampling was performed at a mid-lake station, where vertical profiles of temperature and light were measured in situ, and samples for bacteria and ciliates enumeration were taken throughout the water column. 3. The peritrich Ophrydium naumanni, a freshwater pelagic ciliate with endosymbiotic Chlorella, was the dominant ciliate in the lake. 4. Ophrydium naumanni and autotrophic picoplankton exhibit a clear coincidence in their vertical distribution (P < 0.05), preferring levels at or near the 1\% of surface photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) irradiance. Both may have the same light requirements, or the coincidence may reflect a trophic relationship. 5. Dependence on light and prey by O. naumanni were studied using field experiments, in which we analysed ciliate grazing on bacteria, and in laboratory experiments, in which we compared particle uptake under dark and light conditions. 6. Ophrydium naumanni was able to ingest particles {[}latex microspheres and fluorescently labelled bacteria (FLB)] in field and laboratory experiment, indicating that it has the potential to affect bacteria population of Lake Moreno Oeste. 7. Ciliate particle ingestion was observed to be dependent on light availability because under dark conditions, the ingestion was lowered (P < 0.05).",WILEY,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",English,"Modenutti, BE (Corresponding Author), Univ Nacl Comahue, Ctr Reg Univ Bariloche, Lab Limnol, Unidad Postal Univ, San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.

PCC 6803 is a widely used model cyanobacterium, whose substrains can vary on both genotype and phenotype levels. Previously described phenotypic variations include ability of mixotrophic growth, ability of movement on agar plates and variations in pigments composition or cell size. In this study, we report for the first time significant variation among Synechocystis substrains in complex cellular traits such as growth rate, photosynthesis efficiency, cellular dry weight and cellular composition (including protein or carbohydrates content). We also confirmed previously reported differences in cell size. Synechocystis cultures were cultivated in controlled environment of flat panel photobioreactors under red, blue and white light of intensities up to 790 mu mol(photons) m(-2) s(-1), temperatures 23 degrees C-60 degrees C, input CO2 concentrations ranging from 400 to 15 000 ppm and in BG11 cultivation medium with and without addition of NaCl. Three Synechocystis substrains were used for the comparative experiments: GT-L, GT-B (Brno, CZ) and PCC-B (Brno, CZ). Growth rates of Synechocystis GT-B were inhibited under high intensities of red light (585-670 nm), and growth rates of both substrains GT-B and PCC-B were inhibited under photons of wavelengths 485-585 nm and 670-700 nm. Synechocystis GT-B was more sensitive to low temperatures than the other two tested substrains, and Synechocystis GT-L was sensitive to the presence of NaCl in the cultivation media. The results suggest that stress sensitivity of commonly used Synechocystis substrains can strongly vary, similarly as glucose tolerance or motility as reported previously. Our study further supports the previous statement that emphasizes importance of proper Synechocystis substrains selection and awareness of phenotypical differences among Synechocystis substrains which is crucial for comparative and reproducible research.

However, the capacities and strategies of the algae to adapt to changing conditions may vary due to different nutritional requirements of individual species. In this context, comparative analyses evaluating the physiological range of mixotrophic chrysophytes are important to predict possible changes in phytoplankton composition. We compared 4 freshwater chrysophytes-Poteriospumella lacustris, Poterioochromonas malhamensis, Dinobryon divergens and Mallomonas annulata-under different growth conditions. The diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum served as a photoautotrophic reference strain. We demonstrate active growth of P. lacustris and the mixotrophic P. malhamensis under chemoheterotrophic conditions. Neither of the chrysophytes were growing photoautotrophically; however, P. malhamensis showed some photosynthetic activity and survived longer when kept in the light. M. annulata, P. tricornutum and the mixotrophic D. divergens showed light-limited growth when kept in inorganic media. Even though D. divergens consumed living bacteria, it did not grow in the dark in the presence of the bacteria only.

Biomasses of Dinophysis norvegica (Clapared \& Lachmann 1859), Prorocentrum lima ((Ehrenberg) F.Stein 1878) and Peridinium aciculiferum (Lemmermann 1900) had very similar positive relationships with salinity, temperature, phosphorus and suspended particulate organic matter concentrations while the biomass of the other common species Peridinium cinctum ((Muller) Ehrenberg 1832) and Peridinium sp. mostly showed quite opposite trends. Climate fluctuations leading to changes in the environmental variables could significantly affect the composition and productivity of the dinoflagellate community. Biomass of Glenodinium sp. and Peridinium sp. positively correlated with primary production and biomass and chlorophyll a concentration, but did not show a positive relationship with phosphorus. This may be due to the fact that these species in the conditions of the Neva Estuary, apparently, are more consumers than producers of organic matter, feeding on algae and cyanobacteria of phytoplankton. Therefore, to interpret the relationships between the dinoflagellate biomass and environmental variables one should take into account that the species of this group is characterized by mixotrophy and, consequently, their biomass may depend not only on the conditions of autotrophic, but also heterotrophic nutrition.

For latitude regions with high light irradiance for a greater part of year, it is important to optimize the proportions of critical nutrients for microalgae species to display a suitable metabolic profile and not loose advantage when total light energy input increases. In this study, the conjunct impact of light intensity using white LED, together with photoperiod and nutrients (nitrate, phosphate and glucose) depleted and replete conditions on energy storage metabolites and fuel characteristics of Scenedesmus sp. were investigated under a mixotrophic growth regime. Results show that Scenedesmus sp. could efficiently exploit even very intense light, for longer duration (216 mmolm(-2)s(-1) at 16:8 light: dark photoperiod) in presence of 1.5 g/L of sodium nitrate, 0.04 g/L of di-sodium hydrogen phosphate and 5 g/L of glucose (G(5)N(1.5)P(0.04)) to produce a biomass of 1782.4 +/- 56.8 mg/mL with a specific growth rate of 0.2 +/- 0.007 day(-1). High light intensity (216 mmolm(-2)s(-1)) and organic carbon at 16:8 light: dark photoperiod (L-16:D-8) led to increased synthesis of carbohydrate content in the absence of nitrate and phosphate (1924.8 +/- 128.6 mg/mg at G(5)N(0)P(0)), increased TFA in the absence of nitrate (59.5 mg/mg at G(5)N(0)P(0.04)) and high lipid content (154.1 +/- 7.7 mg/mg at G(5)N(1.5)P(0.04)) without obliterating growth. Certain vital properties that determine the biodiesel quality were computed and compared to the parallel parameters put forth by European and American biodiesel norms. These results stand to be a baseline for sustainable algal bio-refinery and create futuristic vistas for further evaluation of Scenedesmus sp. for bio-energy applications in countries like India having tropical climate with high solar incoming radiation for a greater part of the year.

We assessed community structure changes in a natural mixed dinoflagellate bloom incubated at three pCO(2) levels (230, 433, and 765 ppm) in a short-term experiment (2 weeks). The four dominant species were then isolated from each treatment into clonal cultures, and maintained at all three pCO(2) levels for approximately 1 year. Periodically (4, 8, and 12 months), these pCO(2)-conditioned clones were recombined into artificial communities, and allowed to compete at their conditioning pCO(2) level or at higher and lower levels. The dominant species in these artificial communities of CO2-conditioned clones differed from those in the original short-term experiment, but individual species relative abundance trends across pCO(2) treatments were often similar. Specific growth rates showed no strong evidence for fitness increases attributable to conditioning pCO(2) level. Although pCO(2) significantly structured our experimental communities, conditioning time and biotic interactions like mixotrophy also had major roles in determining competitive outcomes.

These orchids are characterized by two mechanisms of carbon assimilation, being autotrophic carbon fixation through photosynthesis supplemented by heterotrophic carbon fixation from mycorrhizal fungi. We investigated whether photosynthesis may sustain autotrophy of several species of orchids co-occurring in the same habitat (the understory of a chestnut forest in the Apennines range) along a vegetative season, and how photosynthesis responds to environmental parameters in the different species. Combined analysis of gas-exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, optical properties, chlorophylls concentration, and Ribulose 1,5 bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) activity were carried out to characterize the photosynthetic apparatus of the orchid species. Both in vivo and in vitro measurements indicated that in all orchids, in natural conditions and over the entire vegetative season (May to July), a detectable amount of carbon, typical of autotrophic shade leaves, is fixed. It is therefore suggested that these orchids are predominantly autotrophic. As an exception, however, Limodorum abortivum, a co-occurring orchid in the examined habitat, is unable to photosynthesize at rates compatible with autotrophy. At the low light intensity experienced in the understory habitat all orchids exhibited a similar quantum yield, but photosynthesis of Dactylorhiza saccifera and Cephalanthera longifolia was stimulated by light intensities higher than ambient, indicating that these species may better use sunflecks reaching the understory vegetation. Photosynthesis of all orchids, including Limodorum, positively responded to increasing CO2 concentration and temperature. Whether this will lead to a larger photosynthetic carbon fixation because of present and future climate change needs to be assessed with long-term experiments also including the impacts of climate on mychorrizal activity and host plants.",TAYLOR \& FRANCIS LTD,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",English,"Loreto, F (Corresponding Author), CNR, Ist Biol Agroambientale \& Forestale, Via Salaria Km 29,300, I-00016 Rome, Italy.

Measurements of dark respiration under closed circuit conditions at every two-hour interval during the night did not reveal any limiting by lack of the substrate under mixotrophic culture conditions.  A mathematical model of the influence of ambient CO2 concentration on net CO2 uptake rates under closed circuit conditions was devised and used to compare net photosynthesis at different lighting levels.

Mironovskaya 808) was studied on plants grown in water culture. The plants were examined at the mixotrophic stage of growth period, during their transition from vegetative state to relative dormancy in autumn. The average temperature over 10 days of the experiment was 6 degrees C at 9-h photoperiod and illuminance of 8-20 klx. The source strength was suppressed successively with a series of treatments: intact control plants (V1); plants with the seed endosperm removed (V2); plants with photosynthesis inhibited (V3); plants with the seed endosperm removed and photosynthesis inhibited (V4); plants with the seed endosperm removed, photosynthesis inhibited, and the root nutrient medium replaced with distilled water (V5). On the 6th-10th day of the experiment, the relative growth rate (RGR) was determined from dry weight increments. At the same time, the distribution of biomass among organs, the CO2 exchange rates (photosynthesis and dark respiration), the content and proportions of sugars (sucrose, glucose, and fructose), the total content of phenolic compounds and flavonoids, the index of membrane stability (IMS) in leaves, and frost hardiness of plants were measured. Frost hardiness of vegetating plants was shown to be inversely related to RGR (R = -0.906), dark respiration rate (R = -0.789), the percentage of sucrose in total sugar content (R = -0.737), leaf IMS (R = -0.390), and the rate of apparent photosynthesis (R = -0.288); it was directly proportional to the content of flavonoids (R =0.973), total phenols (R = 0.743), and sugars (R = 0.385). The role of modified source-sink relations in frost hardiness of vegetating plants at the stage of their transition to cold hardening is discussed.

ELA experienced a cyclical wet-dry-wet pattern from 1968 to 1998, with the early 1970s and 1990s having above-average precipitation and the 1980s being a period of drought with a 2 degrees C increase in air temperature. During this drought, the length of ice-free season, duration of stratification, depth of the euphotic zone, and light extinction increased while precipitation and nutrient inputs to the lakes decreased. Phytoplankton assemblages of four study lakes were temporally coherent. During the drought, phytoplankton biomass and the number of phytoplankton species increased despite decreased nutrient inputs. There was a noticeable shift in species composition to greater abundances of dinoflagellates and large chrysophytes-mixotrophic species capable of cycling through the deeper, lower light, high-nutrient waters, presumably to consume bacteria as an alternative to autotrophic production.

K. veneficum has a mixed nutritional mode and relies on both photosynthesis and phagotrophy for growth; it is a mixotroph. Here, a model of mixotrophic growth of K. veneficum (MIXO) was developed, calibrated with previously-reported laboratory physiological data, and subsequently embedded in a 3D-coupled hydrodynamic (ROMS)-biogeochemical (RCA) model of eutrophic Chesapeake Bay, USA. The resulting ROMS-RCA-MIXO model was applied in hindcast mode to investigate seasonal and spatial distributions. Simulations showed that K. veneficum blooms occurred during June-August and were confined to the upper and middle Bay, consistent with long-term field observations. Autotrophic growth dominated in spring but heterotrophic growth dominated during the summer. The number of prey ingested by K. veneficum varied from 0.1 to 0.6 day(-1) and the food vacuole content reached up to 50\% of the core mixotroph biomass. The ingestion rate increased with prey density and also when P:N ratio fell below similar to 0.03 (N:P similar to 33), indicating that K. veneficum only switched to mixotrophic feeding in P-deficient waters when sufficient prey were available; this occurred during the summer months. The digestion rate increased with both the food vacuole content and temperature.

A study of carbon-concentrating mechanism-related gene expression revealed that the levels of mRNAs, such as CAH1, LCIB and HLA3, were significantly downregulated. This represents a possible method for the reconciliation of CO2-stimulated growth with mixotrophic cultivation of C. reinhardtii in diluted primary piggery wastewater.",IWA PUBLISHING,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",English,"Wang, HY (Corresponding Author), South Cent Univ Nationalities, Coll Life Sci, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.

To overcome these problems, (1) a microalga (Coelastrella sp.) was isolated from an ammonia-rich environment, (2) the wastewater treatment was divided into two steps: a heterotrophic process followed by a mixotrophic process, and (3) a narrower transparent photobioreactor was employed with higher light intensity in the mixotrophic process. Coelastrella sp. removed 99\% of ammonia, 92\% of chemical oxygen demand (COD), and 100\% of phosphorus during the 4-day process. Acetate in the wastewater relieved the ammonia stress on microalgae and promoted algal lipid and triacylglycerol productivity.

Measured quantities included primary production, bacterial production, planktonic community respiration, and algal pigment concentrations. These measurements revealed a classic minimum in photosynthesis in the vicinity of the ETM. Temporal variability in plankton community metabolism, primary production, respiration, and bacterial production were highest in the southern oligohaline region down-estuary of the ETM and appeared to be driven by dynamic bio-physical interactions. Elevated primary production and community respiration in this region were often associated with the presence of mixotrophic dinoflagellates. The dinoflagellate contribution to primary production and respiration appeared to be particularly large as a result of their mixotrophic capabilities, which allow them to obtain energy both autotrophically and heterotrophically. The present study suggests that mixotrophic dinoflagellates play a key role in the pelagic food web in the oligohaline region of Chesapeake Bay, supplying most of the labile organic matter during late winter and spring and also providing a vector for transferring microbial production to mesozooplankton.",INTER-RESEARCH,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",English,"Lee, DY (Corresponding Author), Univ Maryland, Horn Point Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, 2020 Horns Point Rd, Cambridge, MD 21613 USA.

Unlike other cyanobacteria, two different psaC genes have been reported in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803, one (copy 1) with a deduced amino acid sequence identical to that of tobacco and another (copy 2) with a deduced amino acid sequence similar to those reported for other cyanobacteria. Insertion of a gene encoding kanamycin resistance into copy 2 resulted in a photosynthesis-deficient strain, CDK25, lacking the PsaC, PsaD and PsaE polypeptides in isolated thylakoid membranes, while the PsaA/PsaB and PsaF subunits were found. Growth of the mutant cells was indistinguishable from that of wild-type cells under light-activated heterotrophic growth (LAHG). A reversible P700(+) signal was detected by EPR spectroscopy in the isolated thylakoids during illumination at low temperature. Under these conditions, the EPR signals attributed to F-A and F-B were absent in the mutant strain, but a reversible F-x signal was present with broad resonances at g = 2.079, 1.903, and 1.784. Addition of PsaC and PsaD proteins to the thylakoids gave rise to resonances at g = 2.046, 1.936, 1.922, and 1.880; these values are characteristic of an interaction-type spectrum of F-A(-) and F-B(-). In room-temperature optical spectroscopic analysis, addition of PsaC and PsaD to the thylakoids also restored a 30 ms kinetic transient which is characteristic of the P700(+){[}F-A/F-B](-) backreaction. Expression of copy 1 was not detected in cells grown under LAHG and under mixotrophic conditions. These results demonstrate that copy 2 encodes the PsaC polypeptide in PSI in Synechocystis 6803, while copy 1 is not involved in PSI; that the PsaC polypeptide is necessary for stable assembly of PsaD and PsaE into PSI complex in vivo; and that PsaC, PsaD and PsaE are not needed for assembly of PsaA-PsaB dimer and electron transport from P700 to F-x.",SPRINGER,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",English,"YU, JP (Corresponding Author), MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, US DOE, PLANT RES LAB, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA.

Blue + red combined with natural ventilation resulted in efficient shoot proliferation. Paclobutrazol increased the pigment content. Photomixotrophic micropropagation systems have been associated with improved development of several plant species. In this work, we established an efficient protocol for the in vitro micropropagation of Bambusa oldhamii Munro by studying the influence of the rainy and dry seasons on plant tissue contamination, the effects of the gaseous atmosphere inside the culture flasks, and the effects of radiation conditions on plant morphogenetic events. Explants were collected from March to December 2016. The conditions consisted of 100\% blue (455 nm), 100\% red (630 nm), 30\% blue + 70\% red, and 30\% red + 70\% blue LED light or fluorescent light only (as a control). For induction of axillary sprouting, the explants were inoculated in MS media + 2.27 mu M thidiazuron or 3.40 mu M paclobutrazol. The best growth responses were observed for material collected from June to July. There was an increase of 81.79\% in the number of leaves under the 30\% blue + 70\% red LED treatment in comparison to the control. The facilitation of gas exchange resulted in improved shoot production, with an increase of 70.80\% under 30\% red + 70\% blue LED light in comparison to that of treatments without gas exchange. The blue LED light had an important photomorphogenic effect on the development of bamboo explants into shoots, as shoot proliferation increased.

Outbreaks of Pfiesteria piscicida (Dinophyceae) were observed during 1997 in several Chesapeake Bay tributaries, while in 1998, Pfiesteria-related events were not found but massive blooms of Prorocentrum minimum (Dinophyceae) occurred. In 1999, Aureococcus anophagefferens (Pelagophyceae) developed in the coastal bays in early summer in sufficient densities to cause a brown tide. In 1997, toxic Pfiesteria was responsible for fish kills at relatively low cell densities. In 1998 and 1999, the blooms of P. minimum and A. anophagefferens were not toxic, but reached sufficiently high densities to have ecological consequences. These years differed in the amount and timing of rainfall events and resulting nutrient loading from the largely agricultural watershed. Nutrient loading to the eastern tributaries of Chesapeake Bay has been increasing over the past decade. Much of this nutrient delivery is in organic form. The sites of the Pfiesteria outbreaks ranked among those with the highest organic loading of all sites monitored bay-wide. The availability of dissolved organic carbon and phosphorus were also higher at sites experiencing A. anophagefferens blooms than at those without blooms. The ability to supplement photosynthesis with grazing or organic substrates and to use a diversity of organic nutrients may play a role in the development and maintenance of these species. For P minimum and A. anophagefferens, urea is used preferentially over nitrate. Pfiesteria is a grazer, but also has the ability to take up nutrients directly.

Many plants have evolved isoprene synthases (IspSs) with the capacity to liberate isoprene from dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP) as part of cellular thermotolerance mechanisms. Isoprene is hydrophobic and volatile, rapidly leaves plant tissues and is one of the main carbon emission sources from vegetation globally. The universality of isoprenoid metabolism allows volatile isoprene production from microbes expressing heterologous IspSs. Here, we compared heterologous overexpression from the nuclear genome and localization into the plastid of four plant terpene synthases (TPs) in the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Using sealed vial mixotrophic cultivation, direct quantification of isoprene production was achieved from the headspace of living cultures, with the highest isoprene production observed in algae expressing the Ipomoea batatas IspS. Perturbations of the downstream carotenoid pathway through keto carotenoid biosynthesis enhanced isoprene titers, which could be further enhanced by increasing flux towards DMADP through heterologous co-expression of a yeast isopentenyl-DP delta isomerase. Multiplexed controlled-environment testing revealed that cultivation temperature, rather than illumination intensity, was the main factor affecting isoprene yield from the engineered alga.

Methods : We quantitatively assessed the effect of sugar amendments on laboratory growth of Sphagnum compactum as a representative emergent peat moss and two species of ecologically associated zygnematalean algae, Cylindrocystis brebissonii and Mougeotia sp. Key results : Together with observations published elsewhere, our results suggest that under carbon or light limitation, the uptake of exogenous sugars by cells of charophycean algae and peat mosses may help these organisms maintain positive carbon balance. Utilization of 1\% glucose by aquatic-grown algae helped to relieve dissolved inorganic carbon limitation, enhancing photoautotrophic growth by factors of 9.0 and 1.7, respectively. After an 8-wk growth period, amendments of 1\% and 2\% glucose enhanced air-grown moss biomass by 28 and 39 times, respectively, that of controls lacking sugar amendments. After 9 wk, 1\% fructose enhanced biomass by 21 times, and 2\% sucrose enhanced biomass by 31 times. Conclusion : Our results indicate that plant mixotrophy is an early-evolved trait. The results also indicate that quantitative differences in sugar utilization by bryophytes and charophycean algae correlate with relative investments in protective cell-wall polyphenolics measured in previous studies, suggesting that sugar utilization may subsidize the cost of producing phenolic wall compounds in bryophytes.",BOTANICAL SOC AMER INC,"PO BOX 299, ST LOUIS, MO 63166-0299 USA",English,"Graham, LE (Corresponding Author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Bot, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

In this study, the remaining hemicellulosic sugary waste fraction of a wheat straw biorefinery approach, without any pretreatment, was applied as a medium supplement for Chlorella vulgaris cultivation. Next to oligomeric and monomeric sugars, the waste stream contained hydrolysis by-products, such as furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and acetic acid. Despite the presence of these growth inhibitors, C. vulgaris cultivation was possible. Addition of 2.5\% (v/v) of wheat straw hydrolysate to BG11-medium boosted chlorophyll content in C. vulgaris by 40\% compared to photoautotrophically grown cells solely cultivated on defined media. As of now, this is the highest chlorophyll content obtained from a cultivation of C. vulgaris on a medium supplemented with a waste stream. Overall, our results demonstrate that wheat straw hydrolysate increases chlorophyll biosynthesis, improving the nutritional value of C. vulgaris biomass for food and feed applications. Hence, valorization of this hemicellulosic sugary fraction results in an additional high-valued product contributing towards the wheat straw biorefinery.",SPRINGER,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",English,"Kopp, J (Corresponding Author), Tech Univ Wien, Inst Chem Environm \& Biosci Engn, Res Div Biochem Engn, Gumpendorferstr 1a, A-1060 Vienna, Austria.

However, less than 2\% of red mud produced is currently utilized. Red mud contains a number of residual scarce metals including rare earth elements, some at a considerable concentration, so synchronous cultures of the red microalga Galdieria sulphuraria were tested for their ability to grow in red mud-containing medium and accumulate these rare earth elements from the mud. Red mud was added to the growth medium as an acid extract (in 10\% v/v HNO3). Pigment content and photosynthetic performance are indicators of physiological condition and stress levels in microalgae. Growth of the treated culture was suppressed compared to an untreated control and the content of chlorophyll a and phycocyanin decreased while carotenoids increased substantially. Photosynthetic performance, determined as Fv/Fm, was almost unaffected by the red mud treatment. The concentration of individual rare earth elements in the red mud extract and the biomass, was determined using ICP-MS. The most accumulated rare earth elements were Ce, Nd, La, and Y (26, 15, 11 and 11 mu g g(-1) DM, respectively). G. sulphuraria was also cultivated under different trophic regimes, auto- and mixotrophically, with the addition of red mud extract. Growth of all cultures were comparable. The concentration of total accumulated rare earth elements was surprisingly high in mixotrophic G. sulphuraria (109 mu g g(-1) DM) but was tenfold lower in the autotrophic culture.",SPRINGER,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",English,"Vtov, M (Corresponding Author), Czech Acad Sci, Ctr Algatech, Lab Cell Cycles Algae, Inst Microbiol, Novohradska 237, Trebon 37981, Czech Republic.
